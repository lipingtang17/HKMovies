Morning!Been working all night again?Yes!You better go upstairs quickly.Mr. Han was coughing all night again.Thank you!College graduate!Haven't you gone to bed yet?No, I want to finish this for the paper.Why aren't you asleep yet?I bought some medicine. I'll fix it for you.Good morning, Mrs. Han!Morning!Morning!Mr Han's an

Mrs Han works as a hostess.What sort of world is this?I reckon you're no better!Quick! Go line up for water!  OK.Here's something for you to play with.Off to work so early, Brother Fook?That's right, Uncle Chan.The sooner it's sold, the sooner I'm home.The later I go to Boss Chin'sto exchange this cash,the fewer HK dollars it's worth!Ah Fook!  What is it?Go see if the cheongsam's dry yet.Go see if the cheongsam's dry yet.Yes, almighty wife!How's Little Fook?He still seems
to have a slight temperature.I'll take him to the doctor when I'm back.Morning!Morning!Shanghai Po.  Ah Heung, you're back.Yes. Soap's gone up again.I could have bought two bars yesterdayfor the same price as one today!How will I ever get through times

Moving here from Shantung,I don't know anyone around here.Besides, even a doctor needs luck.This time, Dr Kim,
you should charge more.This time, Dr Kim,
you should charge more.No, I couldn't. A doctor must have ethics.In Shantung, I never charged the poor.In Shantung, I never charged the poor.In that case, I'll register with you!But a poor people like mewould rather die than be sick.So, I'd better go iron your trousers.Thank you.  Don't mention it.Oh, wifey!Look.
The rats have eaten up the paste again.What are we going to do?Borrow some flour from
Wo Kee to make more.We can't.
We still owe them from last time.We'll give it all back tomorrow.How can I work without glue?Fourth sister.  Morning!Do you have any flour?Just ran out. But dad's gone to buy some.Mrs Chan, the rats got at the paste again?Yes!How come there's
only half a bag of flour?Don't you know, the price went up again.The price of a whole bag yesterdaycould only buy half a bag today!How are we going to stay in business?We can do the same.We can always make our fritters thinner.They're already thin as chopsticks now.They're already thin as chopsticks now.Any thinner and they'll be toothpicks!Mrs Chan,
didn't you say you need some flour?No, I don't need it anymore.Come on,How can a tailor work without paste?No, no.The water's coming! The water's coming!Fourth Sister!Please get a bucket and fetch me some!Come on.Ah Heung, could you let me go first?Sure.You need it right away. You go ahead.Many thanks!Turn it off downstairs! Is this a rebellion?You know very well
I need to wash my face!And yet you turn on the tap full blast!How are we to know you just got up?Anyway, we haven't drawn our fill yet.Giving me grief first thing
in the morning!Damn it! I'll come down and show you.Ma's coming down. What shall I do?So what? It's got nothing to do with you.I...What are you so afraid of her for?You're not allowed to use it, damn it!How long do I have to wait
to wash my face?That's not fair, Pat Koo.You're being unreasonable.Didn't you install a personal water pipe?That's right!What do you mean "personal"?With you turning on the tap full blast,how can any water get up there?Ma, can't you see I'm already queuing?Shut up!
I told you last night to come early.How come you're second in the queue?Don't hit her. Ah Heung let me go first.You let someone else go first!When you know
I need water for washing!You stupid girl!We still have a big bucket upstairs.It's none of your business!Stupid girl! I'll fix you later!Get the hell back upstairs!Damn it!What are you cursing about?It's my water. If I like, I can even sell it.Right, you better sell it then!Damn the whole lot of you! Now listen!I'm making a new rule.From tomorrow, no one gets wateruntil after I've finished using it.That's not right!We all pay a share of the water bill.That's right!You dare bring that up? Let me ask you:how much water do you use
for your share?Don't you remember now?Didn't we agree on the matter?I wash and iron your clothes for freein return for using so much water.If it's all the same to you, fine!I don't need you to wash
and iron from now on.Fine!Now listen, all of you!From now on, the rule is each householdcan only have one tub of water a day.No way!Damn that bloody bitch!Ah Fook!I'll be right back.Why don't you mind your own business?You're deliberately targeting me!We run a laundry!How can a tub of water a day be enough?Don't worry, Shanghai Po,I, Olive Vendor Fook, am on your side.Big talk, little man.What good are you going to do her?I can spare you half of my daily water.Right, right.What's this, a rebellion? A rebellion?See? There's nothing to fear.There are 72 tenants here.That's 36 buckets of water a day.Enough even for a restaurant!
Thank you!Hear that, Pat Koo?You'll have to wash
your own clothes now!We'll continue lining up for water,and I'll go iron Dr Kim's pants.When my tub's full, please turn it off.Fat pig!Pat Koo, let me tell you,one should never push people too far.You'll get your comeuppanceif you try to hog the water for yourself.Ah Fook, come back here.Have some congee and get to work.Eighth Aunt, I'm having congee.
See you!Come here, Shanghai Po!What do you want? I'm ironing!What are you trying to do?I'm known as the battleaxe around here,and you dare pick a fight with me?You picked the fight yourself.Now you can wash
and iron your own clothes.Iron...iron...iron...oh no!Oh no! These are Dr Kim's trousers!They're the only pair he has!And he has a housecall to make!They're ruined! What do I do now?Congratulations, Shanghai Po!As you sow, so shall you reap!See how nicely you've ironedDr Kim's trousers!Shanghai Po! Shanghai Po!Are my trousers ready?I...Ironed crisply, all ironed to a crisp.What do you mean, ironed to a crisp?Smells good, too.Shanghai Po, I'll pay you later.Dr Kim, look at your leg.Shanghai Po! What have you done?This is my only pair of trousers!My first housecall,
and I have no trousers!Dr Kim, it's not really my fault!It's all because of that bitch!Picking a quarrel while I was ironing!Picking a quarrel while I was ironing!You burned his pants. Don't blame me!That's not right!We all saw it.You dragged her out. Don't deny it!What business is it of yours?That's right, I did call her out,I didn't tell her to burn the pants!But I can say a fair word too:if you want compensation,there's no way this pauper can pay up.so it's just hard luck to Dr Kim!so it's just hard luck to Dr Kim!Pat Koo, what a thing to say!Actually, you should pay for the trousers.What?Yes, you should pay.Shut up!What's this, a rebellion?You bunch of bastards!Making so much noise in the morning!What's going on?This Shanghainese womanwants me to pay for trousers she burnt!What sort of reasoning is that?You burn someone's pants,
and I should pay?Pay on what basis?I wasn't the one who burned the pants,and even if I was,I wouldn't pay if I don't feel like it!How unreasonable can you get?Shantung Man,if you don't want your pants burnt,you should iron them yourself!It's an accident, an act of God,what more is there to be said?But these are the only trousers I have!And I still have a housecall to make!Well, it's no use crying over split milk.I tell you,
you should count yourself lucky.If they'd been stolen instead,you wouldn't have anything left!See? Isn't that fine?You can turn them into a pair of shorts.Just like the Boy Scouts. Marvellous!Shorts are ideal for this hot weather.Oh no.
My son only has one pair of pants.Are these mine?Look...there's my name, Kim!Like I said, when a man's unlucky,even his trousers will lose a leg.even his trousers will lose a leg.You can't blame anyone elseHe's got more bad luck coming.How true!Chow BingKen. Oh no! Brother Bing!Do you know this is yours?Ah Bing! This was made 2 days ago!Ah Bing! This was made 2 days ago!Shanghai Po, stay where you are!I'll sue you! You'll pay me back!You'll bloody well pay me back!Ah Bing,
if you don't want your pants burnt,you should iron them yourself!It's an accident, an act of God,why should anyone pay?Count yourself lucky they weren't stolen,otherwise you'd have nothing left!But now you can turn them into shorts,just like the Boy Scouts. Cool too!Excuse me,
I must go make my housecall.Why give the pants to that damn woman?I didn't!I told Ah Heung to iron it!Ah Heung!  Coming!What is it, ma?Who told you to give the pants to her?You did!You said Shanghai Po does it for free,and only a fool wouldn't take advantage.Godammit! Stupid girl, I'll kill you!Godammit! Stupid girl, I'll kill you!Hold it! Don't hit her!What's the matter with you?He tells you to stop and you stop.Why are you so obedient?Standing there like a zombie!Who are you, you damned kid?Who am l?

You all heard clearly.Let me ask you.
Am I a man or a woman?A man of course!Is Ah Heung a man or a woman?Of course she's a woman!Then isn't it settled? Just now I saidthat I'm a man and Ah Heung's a woman.And you say I got it wrong. Idiot!You son of a bitch, I'll kill you!Stop it!Stop it! Tell them to come!Don't fight! Don't fight!Don't fight! Don't fight!I'll use my lron Palm on him!Don't fight!Don't fight!

I'll see if the congee's ready.We should go wash some clothes.Fat Chai, why is your jacket torn?It must have got ripped just nowin all the commotion.My mum's not back yet. Take it offand I'll mend it for you.Thank you.Give it to me. Thank you!I've only been here a few daysbut I see your mother beat you
all the time.Why is she so cruel?I'm not her real daughter.She bought me when I was 9 years old.No wonder!I'm a bit like you.I also lost my parents when I was little.Fat Chai,have you studied a lot?Who has the money to go to school?I started mending shoes when I was 1 2.Then how come you're so capable?Capable? How so?Like when you opposed Master Bing,and the way you help your neighbors.I don't know how to say it,but well, you're just too good.There's nothing on it, really.As long as a man walks a straight pathand doesn't mind taking a few knocks,he can't go wrong. Is that capable?No. You can mend clothes and I can't,so you're more capable than I am!I'm not talking to you anymore.Fat Chai! Fat Chai!I'm up here!What are you doing up there?Ah Heung's mending my jacket.All done. Thank you!Come have some congee.Ah Heung, you're here too.

What rotten luck!I lost 16 games in 8 rounds of mahjong.Ah Heung, open the door. Coming!Pour me some tea.Dammit! What rotten luck!Ma.Look at your damned face!It makes me angry just looking at you.It's all your fault!Calling me Ma everywhere.Making me lse 16 games in 8 rounds!What are you standing there for?You know very well
I've been playing mahjong.Give a massage already!Put a little strength into it.Haven't you eaten?No, I haven't.Wasn't there half a bowl of leftovers?Half a bowl wasn't filing enough.Damn you!Have you gone crazy?You want to eat me
out of house and home?Can you keep quiet upstairs?If you want peace and quiet,there's a perfect place for it:why don't you go live in a mortuary?You're making dust fall.
We're having congee!You're having congee? So what?It's not as if you're having a full banquet!Answer me! Bitch!What makes you think
you can pick on me?I just happen to like it noisy.Fat Chai, what are you doing?What are you doing?You want to tear the house down?Fat Chai!Let me be, Uncle Yeung.Help! Someone's tearing down the house!You damned kid!Fat Chai!You think I'm scared of you?You think I'm scared, is that it?Fat Chai!What are you going to do?Why are you hitting people?Uncle Yeung, hand me a knife.I'll cut me some pig's trotters!Fat Chai!You dare insult me!Sorry, sorry!You damned kid, I'll show you!Let's see what she'll do.What's all this racket?You've come back just in time.That bloody kid
tried to tear the house down.Smashed up the floorboards.Where?Right here.It hurts! Just now that bastardmade me so mad I couldn't breathe.Now my chest hurts! Oh, the agony!Don't be so angry.Just leave it to me.Why trouble yourself so?Go next door and have a smoke.Calm yourself down, my dear.You're right.Get me the purse, you damned girl!Hurry up! Hurry up!Hurry up! Hurry up! Yes, Ma.Poor thing.Wait for me, you sex fiend!Yes, Your Majesty.Don't I wait for you every night?How can I sleep without you?Wait for me.Watch your step. Go slow.What are you doing, Uncle Bing?What does it matter?Just let me give you a little kiss.Uncle, don't come any closer! No!What's the big deal?Actually I think of you every night,but what can I do
with the missus around?Look at you, so young and fresh;how can that old trout compare with you?Come. Give me a kiss.No! Leave me alone!What's the big deal?No! Uncle, don't come any closerNo! No!What is it!Uncle Bing, don't come any closer!If you do, I'll scream!No, don't!Help!Fire, fire!Fire! Put out the fire!Call the fire brigade!Fire! Fire!Ah Heung, are you all right?
Yes, I'm OK.Fire!, Fire!Uncle Hu! Uncle Hu!Fire! Put out the fire!Put out the fire!What's the matter?Fire!Where's your bell? I lost it.Run!Fire! Help put out the fire!Help put out the fire!Fat Chai, where's the fire?I don't know. I was working,then I heard Ah Heung cry for help,so I thought there was a fire.Damned kid! Where the hell's the fire?If there's no fire,
why did she cry for help?Ah Hsiang, you tell me.I...Don't be afraid.
There's so many people here.I'm warning you, Ah Heung,if you dare say a word,I'll have your Ma beat you to death.I...didn't...You wouldn't dare.Come home with me.All right, show's over, break it up.The firemen are here.Make way! Make way!Move back! Move back!Fire! Move back!Follow me! Follow me!Right over here. Follow me!Here's No. 96!Come on.Wait. You keep watch out here.Go!Who's the landlord?That's me, that's me.So it's you, Big Mole.What's going on? Listen.Can we turn the tap on now?Wait. We're still negotiating.Listen.Cash equals splash, no cash no splash.You pay we spray, no pay no stay.Sorry,
could you explain that again please?What a nuisance. Listen carefully.Listen.Cash equals splash, no cash no splash.You pay we spray, no pay no stay.You're asking for money?Of course, no money, no talk.You'd better make up your mind quickly.The pipe might get blocked any minute.Brothers, you've made a mistake.There's no fire here!No fire?Preposterous! You said it.Are you having us on?Why call us if there's no fire?Who made the call?I did, but he's the one who yelled "fire".This is a serious transgression.Quick, quick.Name and profession?My name's Fat Chai. I'm a cobbler.A cobbler?Cheng, cobblers don't have money.I know. Big mole, come here.According to our new regulations,the one who yells fire gets off,but whoever calls it in is responsible.Also, once we're at the scene,we must hose the house and demolish it.Demolish the house?In case a stove or something turns overand causes a real fire.Right. Level the house!No, don't!Iet's talk this over.Thus speaketh the beauty, lads.Big Mole, you know the score.You name a price.At the very least, one gold bar.What? One gold bar?For this delapidated house?A delapidated house is dangerous.Level it. No!These guys are hard to handle.I think you had better pay them off.What should we do?What's this?Why are you taking my bracelet?Treat yourself to a drink.This is genuine, is it not?Real gold?Of course!We need more than that.Come on, give me a bit of face.Come on, give me a bit of face.All right.

for breaking things?If I had to pay,I wouldn't beak them in the first place.So you don't have to pay
for breaking things?Of course not!OK, listen everyone.She says you can break things
without paying!Let's go upstairs and break all her stuff!All right, all right!I'll pay, I'll pay.I'll pay, I'll pay.Damn you, Fat Chai! That's 210,000,but he still owes me another 210,000.I must be paid today, no matter what.Otherwise,

and saw a manI came back this afternoon
and saw a manrunning down the stairs hurriedly.I thought it was a bit strange.Then I went upstairs
looking for something,and found I was missing
a red cheongsam,a green one as well, and a silk jacket.I realised I'd been robbed!Robbed?Did you take a good look at the thief?Not really, but I thought he resembledNot really, but I thought he resembledthat damned kid, Fat Chai!Are you sure?How can Fat hai be a thief?Nonsense!It couldn't possibly be Fat Chai!Pat Koo, have you gone crazy?I was working all day,
how could it be me?All right, all right.Whether it's Fat Chai or not,there's no need for a commotion.369 is here.A search will sort everything out.That's right. A search!What if he doesn't find anything?The stuff's definitely there.How can he not find anything?What did you say?No...she simply said...if you stole the stuff, it must be there.OK, OK.I'm not afraid of any search.Quiet! Quiet!But what if he finds nothing?Unless that's clear, there'll be no search.Unless that's clear, there'll be no search.He'll find it. What are you afraid f?I'm not afraid.
I've nothing to be afraid of.Listen to me. Fat Chai's right.We must have reward
as well as punishment.Otherwise, the innocent will suffer.Don't you agree?That's right.Lets clear the whole thing up.Lets clear the whole thing up.Alright, alright. Listen, everybody.If I don't find the stuff in there,then Pat Koo, 369,
and I will kneel downand kowtow 3 times to Fat Chai.You heard it. If they find nothing,the'll kowtow to me 3 times!Master Bing, be warned.I'm not letting this go.Relax.Be vigilant, 369. Go!Where's the stuff? Rattan basket...Rattan basket.Ah Bing,Fat Chai's going to jail for sure.Why don't we put up a notice nowto let out his bunk space?You'd like to, wouldn't you?But there's no need to jump the gun.Wait till 369 finds the bundle of clothes.Pat Koo, where did you put the stuf?What did he say?Nothing, he said he's half done.Another half to go.Damned idiot! Can't even search right!There's only one basket on the bunk!But there's nothing in the basket!369, how can you be so stupid?I can't understand it!I put it here myself!What did you say? Nothing!She thought you put the stuff here.You...Can you be mistaken?Didn't you say you put it here yourself?How could I have got it wrong?I definitely put it here!369, forget it.Just haul him off to the police station.Without proof, how can I charge him?Just say he sold off the loot this afternoon.That's wicked!
No wonder you have no son!Fat Chai!I realise why I can't find the loot.You must have sold it off this afternoon.Ridiculous! Don't move!As soon as I saw youI knew you were no good.Come with me to the station!Quiet!I won't let him go. Where's the loot?Hand over the cheongsams!Mr 369, Mr 369!Hand it over!The clothes aren't stolen, they're all here.You damned girl!I'll kill you!The red one, the green, and the silk jacket.They're all here, as you can all see.You three, on your knees!On your knees!What? You want to sell us Ah Heung?Yes.I can't stand her anymore, dammit!That bloody girl has no family loyalty,always taking the side of that damned kid.Pat Koo,she's not worth much to us.If the price's not right, we won't sell.Damn you!
Of course you don't want to sell!You want to keep her for yourself!I don't care if it's $10 or $20,I'm selling her for sure!Wait a minute.You're scaring me!I've found you a good connection.What is it, 369?Come!
 Stop pulling! What's the matter?As soon as I got back to the station house,I heard the Chief wants a 7th wife,specifically between the ages of 1 7 and 1 8,so I imediately thought of Ah Heung.You must be joking!Your police chief's over 60 years old!He'll still want it when he's 80.None of his 6 wives has had a child.Marriage to the chief is like the draft:he offers no betrothal gifts,so you lose out on the dowry!And you call yourself a man of the world!And you call yourself a man of the world!If your daughter marries a Police Chief,what do you care about betrothal gifts!If your daughter marries the Police Chief,he'll be your soninlaw.Think of the advantages that'll bring!Just think it over!Pat Koo, 369's right for a change.Never mind evicting your 72 tenants,you can evict the whole district!Evict the whole city, even!No, that wouldn't do.If I got rid of everyone in the city,there'd just be the few of us left.It'd be too quiet and lonely.You have a point. Yes.369, if this thing works out,I'll reward you two nice plump pigs.Two pigs? That's a bit heavy.You can keep the pigs.Just make sure you ask the Chiefto put a few stripes on my arm.Only a few?You can have an arm full of them!Then you should go make preparations.How disgraceful!Marrying off a 1 9yearold girlto a 60yearold man!Whoever came up with that ideadeserves to have a son with no rear end!No rear end?
He doesn't deserve a son at all!If he can have a son, I should have 10!What kind of life will it
be for Ah Heung?Dad, Little Fook wants me
to buy him sweets.Okay, settle down.Take him outside to paly. Go.Brother Fook.You're back, Brother Fook?How's Ah Heung? Where's Fat Chai?Fat Chai's gone up to see Ah Heung.You stinking beggars!What are you jabbering about?Tell me, you sons of bitches!You know it's my daughter's
wedding day.Why don't you come to congratulate me?One would think you'd all died!They've all gone out to make a living.It's not like
you're giving out bridal money.So why are you all here?
To plot against me?Pat Koo, you've got us wrong.We're discussing what presents to give.Shanghai Po's giving you a bed.I'm going to give you a chest of drawers.A chest of drawers!Mrs Chan's a dozen cheongsams
just for you,since you're giving away your daughter.Remember to make the waist a bit tighter,and the slit higher!There's more.Dr Kim, the Hans,and a few other neighborsare ordering a 3catty gold chain for you.Dr Kim, what an extravagance!I don't know what to say.Ah Fook, you must bring the gifts early,I've got to prepare a banquet for you.Oh, that's not necessary.Of course it is.You're giving me so many gifts,how can I not invite you?But I haven't finished.I didn't sell all my olives today,Dr Kim saw no patients,and we didn't find money on the street.So...What are you saying?So we can't give you anything!Damn you!You stinking beggars!Ganging up to make a fool of me!Wait till my daughter
comes home to visit.Then you'll see!Pat Koo,
aren't you throwing a 10table banquetto which we're all invited?Ten tables? You'll all be stuffed to death!I'll throw all right...I'll throw you all out!Fat Chai, how's Ah Heung?The windows are closed.
I couldn't see her.But I heard her crying insideI think you'd best her away from here.I wish I could, but it's too late.Sir, sir.Madam. Sir.Coming! Coming right down!You stinking beggars.Get ready to move out,or I'll have you all arrested.Hurry up!I must lock the door first.If that damned girl escapes,we'll be in trouble.Madam.Has the Police Chief arrive?Not yet. I saw him getting readyand came to tell youto get ready to welcome him outside.That will certainly please him.Yes, yes. Let's go.Sir. Madam.When you meet
your Police Chief soninlaw,don't forget to mention my stripes!Don't worry. You'll get a bunch of them.Madam, please. Sir, please.Please.What's so funny?What's so funny?Go on up.Fat Chai, what are you going up for?I'm going to save Ah Heung.Don't climb the pipes
or smash floorboards.Ah Heung. It's you!I'm taking you away.Hurry!Madam. I'm going to watch out for them.Hurry!Ah Heung's coming. Ah Heung.Take Ah Heung away while they're gone!Take Ah Heung away while they're gone!I can't go now!I'll get you all into trouble!Your going won't have anything to do
with us.Hurry, go before it's too late!Fat Chai, here's some money.Take Ah Heung and go!Here's some money.Hurry, go!Hurry, go!Where are you going?I'm taking Ah Heung away.You can't go.
Pat Koo's already in the alley.Dammit!What dreadful timing!What dreadful timing!Dr Kim, you're an educated man,Can't you think of some way
to help them?Too bad Mr Han's queuing at the hospital,otherwise there'd be one more personTo help think of what to do. Yes.He's queuing at the hospital?That's it!

you can evict the whole district!怎么会，全城赶尽都行的
Evict the whole city, even!那也不好
No, that wouldn't do.如果把全城的人都赶走了
If I got rid of everyone in the city,就剩我们几个人

It'd be too quiet and lonely.说的是呀！    是呀！
You have a point. Yes.三六九，如果这件事成功了

Then you should go make preparations.真是太缺德
How disgraceful!把个十九岁的女孩子

Whoever came up with that idea生个儿子也没有屁呀
deserves to have a son with no rear end!他就是生没屁孩子都生不出来

If he can have a son, I should have 10!阿香以后的日子怎样过？
