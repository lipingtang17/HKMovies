we'll get the men in the morning.他们怎么还不攻过来？

I'll move all the weapons here.我看不如把兵器先藏起来
I think we should hide them first.来，坐
Come on.别看刚才我们脱身容易
Let's not congratulate ourselves for escaping earlier;那是高进忠他们一时轻敌
It's only because Gao Jinzhong's gang underestimated us这五个人的武功非同寻常

and they're backed by the court.事情本来和你们一点关系也没有的

that's coming off your pay too.And if you open the shop late,
I'll deduct your pay.Yes.It's strange! Why do I trip everyday?Yang Dabao.Yang Dabao.What are you doing up there?Let me see what yourBlack Tiger Clan's
martial arts style is all aboutWhat do you know?
This is the fairy's bowl.I think it's more like a beggar's bowl.Alright. If you can snatch
this beggar's bowl,you're in for a yummy treat.Wear it.I've got it!Yummy food!Very well.Do you believe that
with this pair of chopsticksI can stop you from eating?You don't have a chance to eat anything.When I was learning martial arts
from my dad,that's what he did.For over half a year, I ate plain rice.The main feature of the martial arts
of my family,the Black Tiger Clan is that,we can pick up anything handy beside us,and use it as a weapon.While we're eating...Ain't very nice to eat plain rice
for over six months.Definitely not.But when my dad couldn't stop me...Do you get it?Swallow first, then chew later.For the Black Tiger Clan's martial arts,we can pick up anything handy beside us,and use it as a weapon.That's really something.Don't be modest.The Mantis Style you're learning
is very difficult too.I've never heard about your master.I don't know who he is.How can that be?I met my master three years ago.I was still in my hometown thenKid, c'mon address me as "grandpa"
and I'll let you go.Bastard!Come on, kid!Bastard!Spare us, "grandpa"!Master.Try this.My master left after two years.I didn't even know his name.That's a true master.Both of us have skills,I don't know how longwe must wait
to become something in this fieldthat we can do something great!I'd risk my life for that day!Great!We both want to be heroes,we just don't knowwhen that will happen.I can't wait.It will happen one of these days.Alright! A fight!Get even!I'm going to faint.And you said you want to be a hero,you can't let go of this wine.It's not me, it's my boss.I still need ajob before I become a hero.Right?Go to sleep.You need to get up to work
in the middle of the night."Qingyun Temple"Hong Xiguan."Master Zhishan, Shaolin Monastery"Brother Hong."Fang Shiyu, Shaolin disciple""Fang Meiyu""Fang Xiaoyu"Help him up."Master Xinglong, Lama Clan"Don't move him, help him to sit up.Master Zhishan.Xiguan, you have

Gao Jinzhong and the others.Brother Sande, Tong Qianjin, Nian Ruiqing,Li Jinlun, Hu Weigan... they're all dead.Being emotional is
the cause of internal injuries.Inhale.I understand.They will come to
Qingyun Temple eventually.You're badly injured,
it will take some time to heal.My student Zhou Cheng
runs a martial arts school.You can look for him,
and he can take care of you.If White Brows and Gao Jinzhong come here,I've to put up a fight with them.You can't help in your state.
You should leave soon.Han Qi works as an acrobat

it's very dangerous out there.I'm here to inform you.I know, just head back.Hong Xiguan is injured,
you must hurry and find him.We're staying here temporarily.After the rest of the members are here,I'll contact you, go!Leave at the back door.Alright.I worry about Brother Hong's injuries.Old monk, is there a Master Zhishan here?Good thing that you weren't rude.This is Master Zhishan.I didn't expect he'd be so easy to find.You were looking for me?To kill you.Old one too tough; guess I will
see to the younger ones.Zhishan is the head of
those Shaolin members.His best student is Fang Shiyu.Tackle Fang Shiyu first;
then we'll both kill Zhishan.Fang Shiyu's mother Miao Cuihuasoaked him in herbal medicine
when he was young.It's hard to hurt him with swords
except his crotch.Try to make him kick,
then I'll take care of it.For Zhishan,his weakest parts are his eyes 1and crotch.Attack his eyes,
so that he'll try to protect them.Then I'll attack his crotch.SureGo!Zhishan's dead.Hong Xiguan is the
only Shaolin member left.He's not a threat, I injured him well.Gao Jinzhong, you take the four of them,and try to locate Hong Xiguan.Kill him once you've found him.Yes.Brother Hong.Brother Wang, you're here alone?I got parted from others
after we left Shaolin Temple.I'm still trying to look for
Master Zhishan & the rest.Many of them died in
West Meditation Temple.Zhishan and Brother Fang
are still in Qingyun Temple.I came from there.Where do you plan to go now?Are you hurt?Yes, the master sent me to contact Han Qi.But when I left Qingyun Temple,and bid goodbye to Master XinglongGao Jinzhong and his gang
caught up with me.I'm not sure whether they'll find me here.Then you had better leave.If they get here,I'll deal with them.At least we're here together,we'll think of something.I'm heading off.Try to find Han Qi.Yes.

my master'smaster, Xinglong.He's badly injured.The injured person is inside.He's Hong Xiguan.What?He's Hong XiguanThe one who's wanted by the Court?I never expected that we'd have a chanceto meet such a hero.Looks like he's in a pretty bad state.I'll get the medicine.The old master's prescription would work.Don't let anyone find out though.I wouldn't mind

You didn't get any money.I pawned everything,and now I've all this tofu.What on earth are you two doing?Go get the medicine, hand me the tofu.Yang Dabao, where are you off to?What are you doing?Boss, we've got big business.We have guests who like tofu.Guests? Where?If they are,
bring these to the kitchen first.I'll take care of them.Please sit down.What's on the menu?Oh, tofu.How about some beef first?The beef, we kept it from last month.It's gone bad! Tofu is fresh.But we can't just eat tofu.Tofu is our specialty.We've fried, deepfried, steamed,stewed, diced, chilled,with vegetables, with minced pork,in a soup... you name it, we have it.All of the above!Coming right up...At this time...No one would carry weapons so openly,must be some kind of officers.Thanks.Boss.Master Zeng.What did he buy just now?The best, he's been here a few times.I think someone is badly injured.Internal injuries.Can you remember the prescription?Master Zhou,
this is my friend Official Gao.He's on the Court's order
to catch Hong Xiguan.Please assist him anyway you can.Certainly.We're trying to look for Hong Xiguan.According to my master White Brows,
Hong's injuriescan only be healed by the Lama Clan.I wonder if Hong Xiguan came to you
for help.To be frank, he did.I'm a lawabiding citizen.A traitor like him came for help,I kicked him out right away.If Master Zhou captured him on the spot,you would have
helped the court a big deal.I think master Zhou didn't dare
to kill him.Hong Xiguan has a reputation.There's one prescription
to treat internal injuries.Bear's bladder powder,
rhino's horn powder...Yes, that's our special prescription.Zhu Cai bought this prescription
many times.Could it be...Right. He's cleaning the roomwhen Hong Xiguan came here.Who's Zhu Cai?Don't worry, I can take care of him.He drops by everyday.Cheers! We've found the traitor!Let the "Qi" energy
travel through your body.You three excel in different areas.But no one has taught you about the Qi.That's why you might find it difficultfor some complicated martial arts styles.With your foundation,it's easy for you to learn.Let me teach you
Shaolin's own use of "Qi".Gather "Qi" at diaphragm.We're treating a VIP guest &
we don't have enough chefsIt's a compliment that
we're using your chef.How can I run a restaurant without a chef?Do you have any idea who my guest is?Who cares whether or not
you can do business!Get the chef!Wait...We're just a small restaurant,our chef isn't that good.Yes, the dishes are only good for pigs.Well said.For your VIP guest,our chef is only useful
if you're serving a pig.What are you on about?Stop!Boss, we must.They've got the chef;without him, we've no business.Beat him!Beat him!Come on!Run!I can walk myself out.One, two, three.You broke everything!I'll deduct from your payWhat are you doing?One, two, three.I'm Han Qi.I've seen you act.Brother Hong Xiguan is looking for you.I'm looking for him too.Come pick me up tonight,we'll go meet him.Sure.Master.Zhu Cai, the medicine you bought,who's that for?Speak up! Who's that for?For myself, it hurts here.Must be from the practising.
It's for myself.Hurts here?Yes.Interesting that you can
foresee your own injuries.Speak up! Who's that for?For myself.Where else does it hurt?Here... no... nowhere.What's the medicine for?Only Hong Xiguan would need
a prescription like that.Zhu Cai, if you show Official Gao
to Hong Xiguan,that's a merit.Speak up! Where is Hong Xiguan?He sneaks around in the tofu shop,I think Hong Xiguan could be there.No! He's not!Alright! You did us a favour.Who are you?Let me go! I'm the boss.Chen Ajin, run!Freeze.Where's Hong Xiguan? Speak up.At your grandma's.You! You can't do thatThis is more likely.Set a fire! And we can save them.They're below. We're setting a fire.Run!Don't panic! Run! Go!Run!Over there! Go!Go!Where to?The dye factory is right here,
let's hide inside.No, when they arrive,they would know that we're hiding there.We should hide in
Zhou Cheng's martial arts school.Good idea!Here you are!
Congratulations on catching Hong Xiguan,what an achievement!Well, I'm here.But no one caught me.You stay here. It's better for you.What a meal!Let's not ruin it.That's right.Zhu Cai works in the dye factory,he must be hiding in there.They're in the school, the master...Careful. After you!Me?Go!They're gone.Hey! Come on in! No one's here.I'll take a look first, follow me.How come he's suddenly acting so brave?They're gone, of course he would.It's clear.Next door is the dye factory,
wonder if they're there.No lights. Guess they must have fled.Official Gao, I'm being brave,I deserve a credit.Sure, you do.They're over there at the wall.They're in the dark.Unfamiliarity with the settings
is to our disadvantage.Zeng Shiguang is an example.Go to the magistrate's office
and get some manpower.Block all the exits.Yes.We indeed need the manpower.But it's late in the night,
I'd rather not alert them.And besides,
we haven't contacted the magistrate,I worry that we can't get any help
until daybreak.All we can do is bluff for now,we'll get the men in the morning.Why don't they attack?There's no light.They wouldn't dare to attack in the dark.The archers on the left,
shoot when you spot anyone.Soldiers with axes on the right,
chop if you see anyoneWe'll keep disturbing them over the night.That way, they can't sleep
and dare not escape.We'll launch a proper attack tomorrow.I think it's just a bluff,but we need to be prepared.The power of the palm is
different between yin & yang.After controlling your "Qi" right,
you can master it.Ah Jin, you try.You're not focused enough... once again.That's better.Not bad.Listen up, traitors!
You've been surrounded.This is where you'll die.Ah Jin, no!I brought Zhou Cheng's feast here.Let's have a good meal!That's right. If someone comes close,we can hear.I'll move all the weapons here.I think we should hide them first.Come on.Let's not congratulate ourselves
for escaping earlier;It's only because
Gao Jinzhong's gang underestimated usThose five are very skilled,and they're backed by the court.You had nothing to do with it,I appreciate that you helped me
with my medicine.I wouldn't blame you
for wanting to leave now.I'm their target.Hong Xiguan, you despise us.If I meant anything like that,please let me be struck by thunder.I was wrong, please forgive me.Come on, sit.I'm honoured to have friends like you.This is certainly
something to celebrate for.It's a long night.Let's drink and talk about martial arts.Come!Brother Hong, please teach us.Earlier on, Priest White Brows
learnt from Wudang Clan;Gao Jinzhong remains his best student.I hear they're hoping to build up
a White Brows Clan.We must watch out for Gao Jinzhong first,especially his braid.Know your enemy!Zou Feng's sword strikes fast and sneaky.He has a shield to protect himself.Watch out for his sword
breaking through the shield,that's his trick.Fan Tiancong is a man with
massive strength.I think he's the one hitting the wall now.Each strike is deadly,we must think of a way to deal with him.So boring! Let's check them!Sure.You cover for me.Go!They are the Tiger Kid and Leopard Kid.Tiger Kid has a deadly kick.Leopard Kid kills with the copper ring.Don't think that they're just kids,they're very vicious. You must be careful.The soldiers are gathering,
they'll be here soon.Wait. Come on.Come on.Have a drink.What style is this?The Black Tiger Clan's style.Zhu Cai...Zhu Cai...Dabao...Brother Hong, the soldiers are here!Leave with Han Qi, I'll stay behind.No!I'm injured anyway.Leave now! Or you won't make it!We'll stay behind and block them.Jin's badly injured too.If we all die,
who's going to complete the mission?Run!Run!Shoot!Dabao, we lived life to the fullest.Fun, isn't it?
