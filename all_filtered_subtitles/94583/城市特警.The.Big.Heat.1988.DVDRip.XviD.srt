00:02:02,889 --> 00:02:05,687
Attention all units...
HQ calling Central Patrol.

1
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:08,454
A Chinese male robber
is holding a hostage on Dudell street.

2
00:02:08,661 --> 00:02:10,253
All units proceed immediately.

3
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:20,468
Don't come over. I'll kill him.

4
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:23,834
Don't come over.

5
00:02:30,316 --> 00:02:31,908
Two guards are dead.

6
00:02:36,055 --> 00:02:38,455
Shit, so many of us
and we can't do anything.

7
00:02:38,591 --> 00:02:39,990
We'll be the laughing stock of town.

8
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,652
Let him go.

9
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:45,820
Just like that case of the jeweller's.

10
00:02:45,965 --> 00:02:47,057
That hostage was seriously injured.

11
00:02:47,233 --> 00:02:48,530
He got away
and the hostage was still hurt.

12
00:02:48,701 --> 00:02:50,601
Same deal, the hostage is yours,
I get the nutcase.

13
00:02:56,476 --> 00:02:59,274
You guys will let him go.

14
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:00,639
Get over there.

15
00:03:00,747 --> 00:03:02,339
- Dare you shoot?
- Put your gun down.

16
00:03:03,983 --> 00:03:06,076
You guys never put on a good show.

17
00:03:07,053 --> 00:03:08,543
Put your gun down, get over there.

18
00:03:24,304 --> 00:03:25,794
Kam, take a look at the hostage.

19
00:03:26,706 --> 00:03:28,503
You bastards, shooting at the hostage!

20
00:03:28,641 --> 00:03:30,131
I'll sue you.

21
00:03:30,276 --> 00:03:31,573
Why don't you send me to the hospital?

22
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:35,241
The hostage asked me why I shot him.

23
00:03:35,315 --> 00:03:37,112
I told him the gun misfired.

24
00:03:37,317 --> 00:03:38,511
He says he'll sue.

25
00:03:38,952 --> 00:03:41,250
These guns are supplied by the U.K.

26
00:03:41,387 --> 00:03:43,184
Go sue the England.

27
00:03:43,289 --> 00:03:44,688
- And he started crying.
- Kam.

28
00:03:44,824 --> 00:03:46,121
You go ahead first.

29
00:03:46,826 --> 00:03:49,818
The boss wants to see us.
Let's take his lecture together.

30
00:03:53,633 --> 00:03:55,225
What a mess!

31
00:04:27,433 --> 00:04:30,231
Your spinal nerves
are affecting your right hand.

32
00:04:30,403 --> 00:04:33,395
Making it periodically out of control.

33
00:04:33,539 --> 00:04:35,234
This is very serious.

34
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:39,806
Before it gets worse,

35
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:42,744
you should get a suspension first.

36
00:04:48,855 --> 00:04:51,119
"Malaysia"

37
00:04:59,899 --> 00:05:01,389
"HANG FUNG SHIPPING CO. LTD."

38
00:05:26,292 --> 00:05:29,989
Mr. Tse? I've been looking for you.

39
00:05:30,263 --> 00:05:32,857
One of my staff
left something at the hotel.

40
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:35,797
You've got it, right? Please return it.

41
00:05:39,572 --> 00:05:41,369
Yes, the photo album.

42
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,517
You must have seen the shipping schedule,

43
00:05:55,621 --> 00:05:57,521
and went to check us out
at the Shipping Company.

44
00:06:02,562 --> 00:06:04,257
The guy is too greedy.

45
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:06,161
I don't care where he's from, kill him.

46
00:06:06,332 --> 00:06:07,230
Yes!

47
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:22,973
Petrol.

48
00:07:08,361 --> 00:07:09,259
Send him on his way.

49
00:07:34,754 --> 00:07:36,415
The body is over there.

50
00:07:49,235 --> 00:07:52,295
- What have you found?
- A bag and a HK passport.

51
00:07:52,338 --> 00:07:56,468
Inform the HK Police immediately.

52
00:07:59,111 --> 00:08:01,204
"Hong Kong".

53
00:08:04,217 --> 00:08:07,015

00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:34,711
You remember your old partner,
Skinny Tse.

57
00:08:36,916 --> 00:08:39,908
He may have been killed in Malaysia.

58
00:08:40,052 --> 00:08:41,747
The body will be back tomorrow.

59
00:08:48,494 --> 00:08:51,395
You were such friends with him.

60
00:08:51,564 --> 00:08:56,263
You'd want to do the case anyway, right?

61
00:09:26,032 --> 00:09:27,329
Freeze, Police!

62
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:37,770

All of you stay back.

66
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:12,100
Don't move, get back to the station.

67
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:16,374
Are you alright?

68
00:10:16,882 --> 00:10:19,783
- My leg.
- Tse, brace up.

69
00:11:23,749 --> 00:11:24,841
John.

70
00:11:27,987 --> 00:11:30,080
Two more weeks to the wedding.

71
00:11:31,791 --> 00:11:32,780
Are you regretting it?

72
00:11:38,297 --> 00:11:42,290
The wedding has to be postponed.

73
00:11:43,235 --> 00:11:45,430
Why?

74
00:11:49,942 --> 00:11:51,432
Before it gets worse.

75
00:11:51,644 --> 00:11:53,544
You better apply for suspension first.

76
00:11:55,514 --> 00:11:57,209
I have my reasons.

77
00:11:57,450 --> 00:11:59,350
I've taken on Tse's case.

78
00:11:59,518 --> 00:12:01,816
It's best if we wait
until the case is over.

79
00:12:01,921 --> 00:12:03,115
Let me take you home.

80
00:12:28,714 --> 00:12:29,806
"Malaysia"

81
00:12:35,221 --> 00:12:37,314
Tse looks pretty good all dressed up.

82
00:12:37,456 --> 00:12:38,946
Quite smart.

83
00:12:39,058 --> 00:12:41,356
Looks as if he could live to 90.

84
00:12:41,527 --> 00:12:44,826
Then pop, he's gone.

85
00:12:45,364 --> 00:12:47,195
Hope it's not him.

86
00:12:47,867 --> 00:12:49,767
The loose ends from the drug case
may have caused his murder.

87
00:12:49,835 --> 00:12:50,927
He was followed to Malaysia.

88
00:12:51,103 --> 00:12:54,334
Of course not.
His boss was killed in jail.

89
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:57,739
Tse hid in S.E. Asia cause he wanted out.

90
00:12:58,544 --> 00:13:01,570
My negligence
forced Tse to go into hiding.

91
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:04,810
Sergeant Lan, I'm Waipong Wong.

92
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:06,645
Call this rookie 1006 Kwok Keung Lun.

93
00:13:06,819 --> 00:13:08,116
Tell him to meet me at the morgue.

94
00:13:08,387 --> 00:13:11,686
I'm Pak, not Lan.

95
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:13,884
Sergeant Lan has gone on leave.

96
00:13:14,126 --> 00:13:15,616
I'll call the rookie for you.

97
00:13:21,934 --> 00:13:23,128
Got a call.

98
00:13:28,941 --> 00:13:31,034
- You want to squash me to death?
- Sorry!

99
00:13:31,177 --> 00:13:32,667
Back...

100
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:46,955
Nurse, is it serious?

101
00:13:47,026 --> 00:13:48,823
Over 10 stitches.
Won't be able to sit for a while.

102
00:13:48,994 --> 00:13:50,393
A permanent scar too.

103
00:13:50,563 --> 00:13:51,552
Please call me if there are any changes.

104
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:53,721
I'm from the Police. My name is...

105
00:13:54,934 --> 00:13:56,231
Kwok Keung Lun!

106
00:13:57,870 --> 00:13:59,167
And you're Ada?

107
00:14:03,475 --> 00:14:04,464
This is my number.

108
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:05,737
Call me if something happens.

109
00:14:05,811 --> 00:14:07,904
Call me even if nothing happens.

110
00:14:12,585 --> 00:14:14,780
Shit, forgot to call back.

111
00:14:23,062 --> 00:14:25,053
Inspector Ong from Malaysia.

112
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:34,168
- Our Inspector Wong.
- Welcome!

113
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:37,775
Crime Unit, Chief Inspector Waipong Wong.

114
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:39,104
I'm Chat Fu Ong.

115
00:14:39,311 --> 00:14:40,403
Just call me John.

116
00:14:40,512 --> 00:14:41,604
And me, Ong.

117
00:14:41,981 --> 00:14:42,777
Come inside.

118
00:14:46,619 --> 00:14:47,415
Sorry!

119
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:53,957
Do you know Chief Inspector Wong?

120
00:14:54,093 --> 00:14:54,991
Is he here? He told me to report here.

121
00:14:55,127 --> 00:14:56,924
I'm 1006, Kwok Keung Lun.

122
00:14:58,030 --> 00:14:59,224
Shit!

123
00:15:02,534 --> 00:15:03,626
Let's begin.

124
00:15:03,702 --> 00:15:06,193
- I'm Kam!
- How are you!

125
00:15:06,772 --> 00:15:08,364
Since Malaysia has notified us.

126
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:10,474
We've contacted Tse's family.

127
00:15:10,509 --> 00:15:11,908
He's been missing for 2 weeks.

128
00:15:15,281 --> 00:15:17,579
If Tse's case involves both areas,

129
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:18,947
we'll probably have to go to Malaysia.

130
00:15:19,051 --> 00:15:21,349
- Your turn, Ong.
- Good.

131
00:15:22,454 --> 00:15:23,546
Run it!

132
00:15:27,426 --> 00:15:29,917
The deceased was 1.7m,

133
00:15:30,095 --> 00:15:32,086
estimated weight 45kg.

134
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:33,921
Was burnt with petrol.

135
00:15:34,133 --> 00:15:36,328
Bruises on his bones.

136
00:15:36,435 --> 00:15:38,733
But basically the body is in one piece.

137
00:15:38,904 --> 00:15:42,101
X-ray shows his left leg
has been operated on,

138
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:45,342
where a metal joint was put in.

139
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:49,039
It matches completely with your X-rays.

140
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:34,181
We found his bag at the scene of murder.

141
00:16:34,393 --> 00:16:36,293
With a photocopy of shipping schedules.

142
00:16:37,029 --> 00:16:38,826
Those circled
are ships bounds for Hong Kong.

143
00:16:40,132 --> 00:16:41,827
These duplicated photo
were also in the bag.

144
00:16:42,234 --> 00:16:45,635
Do you recognize?

145
00:16:52,311 --> 00:16:54,211
You won't get sick over this.

146
00:16:54,446 --> 00:16:56,141
The mousetachio is Kanin Ho.

147
00:16:56,348 --> 00:16:58,339
He owns a shipping Company.

148
00:17:06,825 --> 00:17:09,316
He was obviously blackmailed.

149
00:17:10,295 --> 00:17:12,695
As for Tse' murder,

150
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:14,355
the only clue lies with him.

151
00:17:15,267 --> 00:17:17,064
But investigating rich men is a problem.

152
00:17:17,236 --> 00:17:18,931
See if you have enough clout.

153
00:17:25,778 --> 00:17:26,676
John!

154
00:17:26,779 --> 00:17:29,179
The guy with Ho is from Malaysia.

155
00:17:29,815 --> 00:17:31,214
Do you know him?

156
00:17:31,417 --> 00:17:33,214
He is Ching Han,
doing very well in Hong Kong lately.

157
00:17:33,352 --> 00:17:35,343
He's something,
got filthy rich just like that.

158
00:17:35,754 --> 00:17:38,655
Can't imagine he has a clean record.

159
00:17:40,426 --> 00:17:42,223
What are you up to now, Clumsy Lun.

160
00:17:42,428 --> 00:17:43,622
Self-made bugging device.

161
00:17:48,867 --> 00:17:50,459
Doesn't work. No sound.

162
00:17:50,636 --> 00:17:51,830
Maybe the batteries are flat?

163
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:53,663
You're using batteries!

164
00:17:55,007 --> 00:17:57,407
It's the age of hydro-electricity.

165
00:17:57,509 --> 00:18:00,205
You just have to spit on it and it works.

166
00:18:00,379 --> 00:18:01,869
- Have you tried the ones you piss on.
- Kam.

167
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:05,644
You with him go away!

168
00:18:05,784 --> 00:18:07,581
I'm going with the rookie
to check Ho out.

169
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:19,629
We're C.I.D. From Central Crime Unit.

170
00:18:19,965 --> 00:18:22,160
We would like Mr. Ho
to assist in an investigation.

171
00:18:22,234 --> 00:18:23,428
What do you mean by this?

172
00:18:23,569 --> 00:18:24,661
Make an appointment with my office.

173
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:25,964
Should I take a gift too?

174
00:18:26,271 --> 00:18:27,670
I'm not kidding you.

175
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:29,172
Talk to my lawyer.

176
00:18:37,483 --> 00:18:39,178
He's stalling.

177
00:18:50,529 --> 00:18:53,020
Kam, can you see over there
by the flag poles.

178
00:18:53,165 --> 00:18:54,860
Someone's taking pictures of us.

179
00:18:57,035 --> 00:18:58,434
Shit, must be a talent scout.

180
00:18:59,204 --> 00:19:01,900
- There's another there on the podium.
- Kam, Lun.

181
00:19:02,307 --> 00:19:04,104
You fix the one at the flag poles.

182
00:19:50,889 --> 00:19:52,186
They've planned their exit.

183
00:19:53,392 --> 00:19:54,689
I though only cops tailed people.

184
00:19:54,793 --> 00:19:56,385
How come we're being tailed?

185
00:20:24,856 --> 00:20:25,948
Sign here please.

186
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:27,457
Sorry, it's urgent.

187
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:29,216
- Thanks!
- Crime Unit!

188
00:20:29,328 --> 00:20:30,818
Is Inspector Wong there?

189
00:20:30,996 --> 00:20:31,985
Hold on.

190
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:34,991
Waipong Wong!

191
00:20:35,434 --> 00:20:37,129
John, it's me, Maggie.

192
00:20:37,936 --> 00:20:39,767
I told you
we stop meeting each other for a while.

193
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:41,099
Don't call again.

194
00:20:42,307 --> 00:20:43,797
John!

195
00:20:55,687 --> 00:20:57,985
We've got the gay kid who's with Ho.

196
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:01,582
His name is Ah Chi.
Lives in Wanchai, comes out rarely.

197
00:21:01,727 --> 00:21:04,821
Only wholesale deals, no retail trade.

198
00:21:05,063 --> 00:21:07,657
Been to every gay hangout
and 2 guys know him.

199
00:21:09,901 --> 00:21:11,698
- Bring him in.
- Yes!

200
00:21:23,415 --> 00:21:25,110
I'm Inspector Wong from Crime Unit.

201
00:21:25,217 --> 00:21:26,616
We have an appointment
with Mr. Ho at 4 p.m.

202
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:30,115
Do you have a booking?

203
00:21:30,255 --> 00:21:31,847
How can you say there's no appointment!

204
00:21:31,923 --> 00:21:33,322
I came personally yesterday.

205
00:21:33,492 --> 00:21:35,687
Mr. Ho is busy for the rest of the month.

206
00:22:03,922 --> 00:22:04,911
Open up.

207
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,559
So noisy, must be a gay party.

208
00:22:24,276 --> 00:22:25,174
Open up.

209
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:35,650
Shit.

210
00:23:17,996 --> 00:23:19,190
Is John there?

211
00:23:19,331 --> 00:23:20,923
What? Go on.

212
00:23:21,099 --> 00:23:25,798
The circled ship is arriving today
and will leave in 2 days' time.

213
00:23:25,937 --> 00:23:27,336
Do we have time to apply for a permit.

214
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:30,935
It's too big,
we won't have time to search.

215
00:23:31,042 --> 00:23:32,839
We'll discuss it when I get back.

216
00:23:52,664 --> 00:23:54,256
The guy's still following.

217
00:23:54,499 --> 00:23:56,399
I know I've failed.

218
00:23:56,501 --> 00:23:57,900
Tried twice to meet the guy.

219
00:23:58,069 --> 00:23:59,263
I didn't mean you.

220
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:01,929
I meant those guys are tailing us again.

221
00:24:02,073 --> 00:24:02,767
Tailing us?

222
00:24:02,874 --> 00:24:04,068
- If send up here.
- Where?

223
00:24:04,176 --> 00:24:05,268
Let's play hide and seek.

224
00:24:08,413 --> 00:24:09,505
Don't scare them.

225
00:24:09,648 --> 00:24:11,047
You take one end, I'll take the other.

226
00:24:12,017 --> 00:24:12,915
Go!

227
00:24:13,385 --> 00:24:14,579
Careful!

228
00:24:26,131 --> 00:24:27,325
Freeze, C.I. D!

229
00:24:37,909 --> 00:24:39,103
Gun, he's got a gun.

230
00:24:53,625 --> 00:24:54,523
Move off.

231
00:24:56,495 --> 00:24:57,291
Freeze.

232
00:25:05,504 --> 00:25:07,096
You've got guns too. You can shoot too!

233
00:25:27,192 --> 00:25:30,889
Hell.

234
00:25:47,112 --> 00:25:49,603
You're lucky to be alive.

235
00:25:49,781 --> 00:25:51,976
Are you alright?
Scared the hell out of me.

236
00:26:54,813 --> 00:26:56,303
Well, Sir?

237
00:26:57,449 --> 00:26:58,541
What about the one you were after?

238
00:26:58,750 --> 00:27:00,945
- He got away.
- O. K?

239
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:02,416
Fine.

240
00:27:04,656 --> 00:27:06,351
- Fix them up.
- Yes, sir!

241
00:27:28,113 --> 00:27:30,411
Shit! Two are gone in a day.

242
00:27:31,016 --> 00:27:32,608
Looks like a really tricky case.

243
00:27:33,885 --> 00:27:35,785
They really want to know
where we're going.

244
00:27:38,456 --> 00:27:39,650
Ho is leaving for Seattle tomorrow.

245
00:27:39,824 --> 00:27:41,121
What can we do if he leaves?

246
00:27:42,794 --> 00:27:44,386
We can't stop him from going.

247
00:27:44,663 --> 00:27:46,460
But I can fix it so that he can't go.

248
00:27:48,033 --> 00:27:49,523
Kam, let's put on a good show tomorrow.

249
00:27:49,668 --> 00:27:50,862
We'll have some fun with him.

250
00:27:51,036 --> 00:27:53,129
Good, it won't so boring then.

251
00:28:04,549 --> 00:28:07,746
What we do to Ho tomorrow
is not in the rule book.

252
00:28:08,253 --> 00:28:09,811
Can lose your job anytime.

253
00:28:10,021 --> 00:28:11,420
If you don't want to take part.

254
00:28:13,191 --> 00:28:14,385
I'll apply for your transfer.

255
00:28:17,996 --> 00:28:19,896
I'm right behind you.

256
00:28:20,065 --> 00:28:21,555
I can't transfer just after I've started.

257
00:28:21,833 --> 00:28:23,232
We'll have some fun!

258
00:28:27,472 --> 00:28:30,270
You got my photos
to coerce me into co-operation.

259
00:28:30,675 --> 00:28:32,643
Now there's murder and you hang in on me?

260
00:28:32,777 --> 00:28:34,472
Who did you kill in Malaysia?

261
00:28:34,679 --> 00:28:36,271
Why are the cops after me?

262
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:44,215
I've got someone tailing the cops.

263
00:28:44,389 --> 00:28:45,686
Anything happens, I'll handle it.

264
00:28:46,458 --> 00:28:47,857
The guy was killed in Malaysia,

265
00:28:48,026 --> 00:28:51,018
so that your photos won't get out.

266
00:28:51,930 --> 00:28:55,661
Your other Board Members
will not like it.

267
00:28:56,701 --> 00:28:57,998
If this is revealed.

268
00:28:58,603 --> 00:29:01,003
Your companies will suffer.

269
00:29:01,139 --> 00:29:04,734
You know
I can fix the cops and the gangs.

270
00:29:05,210 --> 00:29:07,508
If you're smart,
wait for the cargo to arrive safely,

271
00:29:08,546 --> 00:29:10,844
or else I can squash you
with my little finger.

272
00:29:12,650 --> 00:29:13,639
You hear?

273
00:29:18,323 --> 00:29:20,814
Don't come looking for me.

274
00:29:22,727 --> 00:29:24,922
I'll arrange everything for you.

275
00:29:25,730 --> 00:29:27,721
Someone will meet you in Seattle.

276
00:29:44,449 --> 00:29:45,541
I'm Lun from Crime Unit.

277
00:29:45,683 --> 00:29:46,877
Mr. Ho, lower your window please.

278
00:29:47,018 --> 00:29:47,916
Ignore him, go on.

279
00:29:48,019 --> 00:29:49,816
Mr. Ho!

280
00:29:53,992 --> 00:29:56,187
He really ignored me.

281
00:29:58,163 --> 00:30:00,256
Forget it, we'll move in on him.

282
00:30:00,398 --> 00:30:01,490
Kam, all yours.

283
00:30:01,933 --> 00:30:03,127
Got it.

284
00:30:04,102 --> 00:30:06,297
Get going. You're really slow.

285
00:30:06,638 --> 00:30:08,230
Slow? I haven't seen him yet.

286
00:30:10,074 --> 00:30:11,268
Mr. Ho. It's a red light.

287
00:30:11,442 --> 00:30:12,841
Just go on.

288
00:30:17,882 --> 00:30:19,372
You see that! Aren't you slow? Go over!

289
00:30:38,002 --> 00:30:39,902
Are you crazy? We said punch twice.

290
00:30:41,139 --> 00:30:44,802
Get going, you're slow even to get away.

291
00:30:46,678 --> 00:30:47,576
Where are the car keys?

292
00:30:50,014 --> 00:30:51,413
Wait for me.

293
00:30:56,421 --> 00:31:00,016
Shit, wait for me!
You never told me about switching cars.

294
00:31:04,062 --> 00:31:05,461
Who told you to drive this car away?

295
00:31:05,597 --> 00:31:07,189
We drive it away, he can't move.

296
00:31:07,332 --> 00:31:08,822
Why didn't you say so before?

297
00:31:08,967 --> 00:31:10,366
If I didn't get on,
I'd be in real trouble.

298
00:31:10,602 --> 00:31:12,797
You're so fast, you're bound to catch me.

299
00:31:12,871 --> 00:31:13,963
You're putting me on.

300
00:31:14,038 --> 00:31:17,235
Park it, I'll sort it out with you.

301
00:31:26,284 --> 00:31:27,979
Mr. Ho, what happened?

302
00:31:28,286 --> 00:31:29,378
I don't know.

303
00:31:32,523 --> 00:31:34,115
Those guys were here to beat you up.

304
00:31:34,292 --> 00:31:35,691
They'll probably come back.

305
00:31:35,894 --> 00:31:37,691
You'd better give me a statement.

306
00:31:38,329 --> 00:31:40,524
You are very brave.
I'll sort it out with you.

307
00:31:40,665 --> 00:31:42,656
No one must know we're having it out.

308
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:44,700
I don't think you can take it.
I'll let you start.

309
00:31:44,869 --> 00:31:45,767
You go first. Cari mati.

310
00:31:45,937 --> 00:31:47,131
What "Cari mati", what do you mean?

311
00:31:47,238 --> 00:31:48,728
It's Malay, you want to die, Curry what?

312
00:31:48,973 --> 00:31:50,167
Carry me?

313
00:31:51,175 --> 00:31:52,369
You started it.

314
00:31:53,311 --> 00:31:54,209
I let you go first.

315
00:31:55,446 --> 00:31:56,344
Cari mati!

316
00:32:01,619 --> 00:32:03,917
- Carry me...
- My glasses...

317
00:32:03,988 --> 00:32:06,183
Your reaction is pretty fast too.

318
00:32:06,324 --> 00:32:08,622
Hurry, we're not through yet. Cari mati!

319
00:32:11,329 --> 00:32:13,729
Mr. Ho, look again.
Do you recognize this man?

320
00:32:14,499 --> 00:32:16,296
They were masked.

321
00:32:16,501 --> 00:32:18,196
How would I know?

322
00:32:18,403 --> 00:32:20,496
No! Have you seen him before?

323
00:32:21,005 --> 00:32:22,302
No!

324
00:32:23,007 --> 00:32:25,237
Do you know who Skinny Tse is?

325
00:32:25,376 --> 00:32:26,570
No!

326
00:32:26,678 --> 00:32:28,077
Think clearly.

327
00:32:28,413 --> 00:32:32,406
I don't understand the law.
Talk to my lawyer.

328
00:32:32,617 --> 00:32:34,016
I'm going abroad tonight.

329
00:32:35,053 --> 00:32:37,146
Thank you for letting me
return to the office.

330
00:32:40,558 --> 00:32:44,050
Sign the statement please.

331
00:32:48,266 --> 00:32:49,460
You may go.

332
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:51,500
I know how to look after people
who do not know law.

333
00:32:51,602 --> 00:32:52,694
Thank you for your co-operation.

334
00:32:56,774 --> 00:32:59,971
We'll find your car.

335
00:33:22,667 --> 00:33:24,658
We've sent the stuff out.

336
00:33:25,269 --> 00:33:27,260
- Let's see how he reacts.
- Yes!

337
00:33:28,406 --> 00:33:29,805
Please deliver this
to Mr. Ho immediately.

338
00:33:29,974 --> 00:33:31,771
It's urgent. He must see it at once.

339
00:33:40,985 --> 00:33:44,284
The meeting is adjourned.

340
00:33:46,124 --> 00:33:48,024
He took the photos
and returned to his office.

341
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:50,719
I told him to take $1M
to the cinema tomorrow.

342
00:33:50,862 --> 00:33:51,954
Will he take the bait?

343
00:33:53,231 --> 00:33:54,823
If he is behind Tse's killing.

344
00:33:54,999 --> 00:33:56,990
He's going to
murder this blackmailer as well.

345
00:33:57,468 --> 00:33:59,163
If he calls the police.

346
00:33:59,237 --> 00:34:01,034
Our plan fails.

347
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:05,371
Nobody knows we're behind this.

348
00:34:05,843 --> 00:34:08,334
If he does,
we'll just take over the case.

349
00:34:13,284 --> 00:34:15,411
He's gone downstairs.

350
00:34:19,690 --> 00:34:21,988
Calling station, he's made a showing.

351
00:34:27,131 --> 00:34:28,530
You go and play the blackmailer.

352
00:34:28,733 --> 00:34:29,927
Wait for him in front of the cinema.

353
00:34:30,034 --> 00:34:31,331
What if he recognizes me.

354
00:34:31,569 --> 00:34:33,560
Get made up, then he won't.

355
00:34:33,738 --> 00:34:34,932
Go and get prepared.

356
00:34:35,273 --> 00:34:36,865
Kam, according to plans.

357
00:34:37,542 --> 00:34:39,237
- Follow me.
- Yes!

358
00:34:41,546 --> 00:34:43,241
Will you guys look out for me.

359
00:34:43,414 --> 00:34:44,312
No problem!

360
00:34:46,751 --> 00:34:47,843
Calling grasshopper.

361
00:34:47,952 --> 00:34:49,146
What's it like at the cinema?

362
00:34:49,253 --> 00:34:50,652
We've been watching.

363
00:34:50,755 --> 00:34:53,747
Lun has been waiting for over an hour.

364
00:34:54,659 --> 00:34:56,354
No show.

365
00:34:59,764 --> 00:35:00,958
Nothing here either.

366
00:35:05,503 --> 00:35:08,700
It's not time yet.

367
00:35:09,373 --> 00:35:11,671
Hey, one big blue whale went by.

368
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:14,203
- Everybody stand-by.
- Yes!

369
00:35:14,412 --> 00:35:15,208
Stand-by!

370
00:35:15,346 --> 00:35:16,540
Climbing over at 6 furlong.

371
00:35:20,318 --> 00:35:22,115
Bastard,
you come right through the red lights!

372
00:35:22,286 --> 00:35:22,980
You want to die young.

373
00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:24,713
Can't you see me?

374
00:35:24,789 --> 00:35:25,687
If you die, don't find me.

375
00:35:25,857 --> 00:35:28,348
If you scratch me, I'll sue you.

376
00:35:36,267 --> 00:35:38,064
He's making a call.

377
00:35:39,036 --> 00:35:40,628
- Trace it.
- Yes, Sir!

378
00:35:40,771 --> 00:35:42,568
Trace the call.

379
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:45,841
- Mr. Ching Han please!
- Who is it?

380
00:35:46,410 --> 00:35:48,310
It's Ho! Tell him to come to the phone.

381
00:35:48,446 --> 00:35:50,437
Mr. Han says you
should not call him again.

382
00:35:53,351 --> 00:35:54,750
Han wouldn't take his call.

383
00:36:10,801 --> 00:36:12,291
It's really you!

384
00:36:12,503 --> 00:36:13,595
Something's up.

385
00:36:17,208 --> 00:36:19,904
- Don't move!
- Don't shoot. She's my friend.

386
00:36:20,077 --> 00:36:21,567
Abort. Abort. Everybody in positions.

387
00:36:22,713 --> 00:36:25,705
Are you on duty?
Then I won't get in the way.

388
00:36:26,651 --> 00:36:29,552
Bye bye, careful! Bye bye.

389
00:36:30,021 --> 00:36:31,318
Call me.

390
00:36:32,056 --> 00:36:34,149
- Anything happening?
- Nothing at all.

391
00:36:59,016 --> 00:37:01,314
Help! Come!

392
00:37:01,485 --> 00:37:02,577
Screaming for help!

393
00:37:02,653 --> 00:37:03,745
Go in!

394
00:37:04,288 --> 00:37:05,380
All units, move.

395
00:37:18,669 --> 00:37:19,567
Quick.

396
00:37:20,638 --> 00:37:22,435
Call the police.

397
00:37:34,218 --> 00:37:35,913
You're foolish!

398
00:37:37,021 --> 00:37:38,113
So slow.

399
00:37:41,726 --> 00:37:42,624
What is it?

400
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:43,954
The guy cut his wrists.

401
00:37:44,262 --> 00:37:46,560
Oh shit!

402
00:37:46,631 --> 00:37:48,223
- Get an ambulance.
- Yes, Sir!

403
00:37:48,399 --> 00:37:49,798
Get an ambulance.

404
00:37:50,368 --> 00:37:51,665
He's still alive, get him to hospital.

405
00:37:51,902 --> 00:37:52,800
- Hurry!
- Quick.

406
00:37:53,137 --> 00:37:54,331
Call the Emergency ward to stand-by.

407
00:37:54,472 --> 00:37:55,962
Notify P.C. Chan to seal all news.

408
00:37:56,207 --> 00:37:57,105
Don't let the reporters know.

409
00:37:57,308 --> 00:37:58,502
Also, tell Lun to wrap up.

410
00:38:09,487 --> 00:38:10,385
You're out tomorrow.

411
00:38:10,488 --> 00:38:11,887
Still remember my name?

412
00:38:12,023 --> 00:38:13,217
- Ada.
- Good boy.

413
00:38:13,391 --> 00:38:15,882
- Back home you can't jump.
- OK.

414
00:38:17,361 --> 00:38:18,760
Go see your female patient?

415
00:38:19,196 --> 00:38:20,788
Today you scare me to death.

416
00:38:20,898 --> 00:38:21,887
I have a case at 15th floor.

417
00:38:22,066 --> 00:38:23,158
Tonight I'll be there all night.

418
00:38:23,267 --> 00:38:24,962
Can I go there and find you?

419
00:38:25,036 --> 00:38:27,334
OK, don't forget to bring some food.

420
00:38:27,972 --> 00:38:29,269
What kind of food?

421
00:38:29,407 --> 00:38:32,865
Peanuts, chips, beef jerky, chocolates.

422
00:38:33,811 --> 00:38:35,005
That's junk food.
I'll get you something else.

423
00:38:35,179 --> 00:38:36,373
I bring something else for you.

424
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:37,378
O. K!

425
00:38:40,151 --> 00:38:40,947
Ho is alright now.

426
00:38:41,118 --> 00:38:43,018
- He needs to rest, don't ask too long
- Thanks.

427
00:38:53,964 --> 00:38:55,056
How's going inside?

428
00:38:57,568 --> 00:38:59,559
If you were willing to co-operate,

429
00:38:59,737 --> 00:39:01,227
you wouldn't be in this mess.

430
00:39:01,439 --> 00:39:03,339
Someone is blackmailing you,

431
00:39:03,474 --> 00:39:04,668
so you had him murdered.

432
00:39:05,409 --> 00:39:08,037
Now you know you can't get away with it.

433
00:39:08,312 --> 00:39:09,609
Did you kill Tse?

434
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:11,272
- A lawyer.
- Lawyer obey the law too.

435
00:39:11,515 --> 00:39:14,916
You committed murder.
A lawyer can't save you.

436
00:39:15,019 --> 00:39:15,815
The deceased was my friend.

437
00:39:15,886 --> 00:39:17,478
I'm speaking to you
in a personal capacity.

438
00:39:17,855 --> 00:39:18,947
I want my lawyer.

439
00:39:19,023 --> 00:39:20,991
Don't throw a lawyer at me.
You killed my friend.

440
00:39:21,158 --> 00:39:22,648
- I didn't...
- You didn't?

441
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:24,951
Then why won't you co-operate? You say!

442
00:39:25,496 --> 00:39:26,394
I didn't kill.

443
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:28,623
If you co-operate,
you can avoid a scandal.

444
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:30,394
I didn't kill.

445
00:39:30,534 --> 00:39:31,831
How can you face people now.

446
00:39:33,204 --> 00:39:35,001
Where's your shitty bugging device.
Let's have it.

447
00:39:35,439 --> 00:39:37,430
Did you kill Tse?

448
00:39:37,708 --> 00:39:38,697
- I didn't.
- You still deny it.

449
00:39:38,843 --> 00:39:40,242
No...

450
00:39:40,678 --> 00:39:42,077
Will you talk?

451
00:39:43,514 --> 00:39:44,811
If you didn't, who did?

452
00:39:44,882 --> 00:39:46,577
The one who's blackmailing you.

453
00:39:46,751 --> 00:39:48,150
If not, then you did it.

454
00:39:48,285 --> 00:39:49,479
He can't take it anymore, John.

455
00:39:49,587 --> 00:39:51,384
Don't deny it. Who is blackmailing you?

456
00:39:51,856 --> 00:39:52,845
You're really scum.

457
00:40:00,197 --> 00:40:01,687
Now none is going to protect you.

458
00:40:01,832 --> 00:40:03,629
Your name will be ruined. Talk!

459
00:40:03,801 --> 00:40:06,395
Ching Han! Him!

460
00:40:19,283 --> 00:40:20,272
Come out soon.

461
00:40:21,552 --> 00:40:23,543
Get a doctor.

462
00:40:24,755 --> 00:40:26,655
Kam, burn up this false stuff.

463
00:40:27,725 --> 00:40:28,919
- What is it?
- How will I know?

464
00:40:37,101 --> 00:40:39,092
The only way to save yourself
is for you to,

465
00:40:39,170 --> 00:40:41,263
tell us who's blackmailing you.

466
00:40:41,439 --> 00:40:43,430
Han secretly had me photographed,

467
00:40:43,641 --> 00:40:46,633
and has been threatening me
to help him move cargo with my ships.

468
00:40:46,777 --> 00:40:47,436
What sort of cargo?

469
00:40:47,511 --> 00:40:50,309
Cans. But I don't know what's in them.

470
00:40:50,614 --> 00:40:52,104
How come Tse is involved?

471
00:40:52,283 --> 00:40:54,478
I don't know him.

472
00:40:54,685 --> 00:40:57,176
Han says
Tse found the photos by accident,

473
00:40:57,388 --> 00:40:59,185
and he had to be killed.

474
00:41:00,891 --> 00:41:02,756
What sort of cargo is Han moving?

475
00:41:02,893 --> 00:41:04,190
Not sure moving what sort of cargo.

476
00:41:04,328 --> 00:41:05,420
I'll search in the godown.

477
00:41:06,497 --> 00:41:10,399
"HANG FUNG SHIPPING CO. LTD.
STORE NO. 2"

478
00:41:30,321 --> 00:41:31,413
Door's open.

479
00:41:34,825 --> 00:41:36,520
Told you it's open.

480
00:41:38,195 --> 00:41:39,127
Bother.

481
00:42:05,890 --> 00:42:08,484
Shit, telling me to watch these guys.

482
00:42:08,692 --> 00:42:10,091
Wasting my talents.

483
00:42:10,261 --> 00:42:12,661
I will be change a gay early or lately.

484
00:42:12,796 --> 00:42:14,195
If I go on the streets,

485
00:42:14,498 --> 00:42:15,863
crime rate would fall.

486
00:42:16,033 --> 00:42:17,022
"DISPENSARY"

487
00:42:46,397 --> 00:42:47,295
Got it!

488
00:42:56,340 --> 00:42:57,432
Let's move this out.

489
00:42:57,608 --> 00:42:59,200
- Put the goods onto the truck quickly.
- Yes.

490
00:42:59,410 --> 00:43:00,604
We'll move it all out tonight.

491
00:43:00,678 --> 00:43:02,373
- Meal's on me.
- O. K!

492
00:43:02,613 --> 00:43:04,604
He looks familiar. Do you know him?

493
00:43:04,748 --> 00:43:06,841
It's the number 1 from the next district.

494
00:43:07,117 --> 00:43:08,414
Han is really good.

495
00:43:08,919 --> 00:43:10,614
Got our people too.

496
00:43:17,494 --> 00:43:21,487
- Blonde chick.
- Target for emigration.

497
00:43:31,275 --> 00:43:33,766
This is even better, can't emigrate,
pick this one.

498
00:43:35,245 --> 00:43:36,143
Where's my snack?

499
00:43:36,246 --> 00:43:37,645
- Catch!
- Thank you!

500
00:43:38,215 --> 00:43:40,809
Peanuts, kumquats, apricots,
beef jerky and chocolates.

501
00:43:41,352 --> 00:43:43,149
- You have to eat it all up.
- O. K!

502
00:43:44,355 --> 00:43:46,152
- He's my partner, Kam!
- Hello!

503
00:43:46,323 --> 00:43:48,416
Clumsy Lun,
I see you're not so clumsy now.

504
00:43:48,692 --> 00:43:50,284
Really, is he clumsy?

505
00:44:22,593 --> 00:44:24,083
- Well, enough?
- Miss!

506
00:44:24,294 --> 00:44:26,285
All the nurses are so pretty.

507
00:44:26,463 --> 00:44:28,363
Even that blonde nurse
just now is pretty.

508
00:44:28,666 --> 00:44:31,157
Blondes!
This hospital has only Chinese nurses.

509
00:44:35,406 --> 00:44:36,998
- The salt water bottle.
- Shit!

510
00:44:37,708 --> 00:44:38,902
Where are you going?

511
00:45:10,074 --> 00:45:11,166
Sorry!

512
00:45:25,222 --> 00:45:26,314
- What is it?
- Look after Mr. Ho!

513
00:45:26,423 --> 00:45:27,321
Lun, what is it?

514
00:45:34,598 --> 00:45:35,496
Hurry and get out.

515
00:45:35,666 --> 00:45:37,065
- Get her out.
- Yes, Sir!

516
00:45:46,110 --> 00:45:47,099
What's happened?

517
00:45:51,148 --> 00:45:53,446
Careful. Take Ho to the 13/F. Quick!

518
00:46:03,894 --> 00:46:04,883
Hold it!

519
00:46:16,740 --> 00:46:18,332
- Something is wrong upstairs.
- Shit!

520
00:46:20,544 --> 00:46:23,445
Auntie...

521
00:46:32,756 --> 00:46:33,848
Kam, come with me.

522
00:46:55,712 --> 00:46:56,406
Hurry up!

523
00:47:00,317 --> 00:47:02,012
Hurry! Get up!

524
00:47:08,091 --> 00:47:09,888
Kam, turn off the mains.

525
00:47:22,873 --> 00:47:23,965
Coming down, hurry.

526
00:47:27,811 --> 00:47:28,607
Damn you!

527
00:48:21,198 --> 00:48:22,290
Wong, are you really?

528
00:48:22,432 --> 00:48:23,831
Yes, have you seen him?

529
00:48:24,001 --> 00:48:24,797
No.

530
00:48:28,205 --> 00:48:28,899
Oh, I seen him.

531
00:49:05,475 --> 00:49:06,567
Wong!

532
00:49:07,878 --> 00:49:09,368
What are you doing here, go down.

533
00:49:14,117 --> 00:49:15,209
Kam, careful down below.

534
00:49:26,630 --> 00:49:27,927
What are you doing below.

535
00:49:28,098 --> 00:49:29,395
I hit the safety switch by mistake.

536
00:49:59,830 --> 00:50:00,524
Shit!

537
00:50:06,303 --> 00:50:08,498
That guy's hanging.

538
00:50:17,581 --> 00:50:20,379
Help me! I can't take it, save me!

539
00:50:27,657 --> 00:50:28,851
I can see him, John!

540
00:50:29,259 --> 00:50:30,351
Is he near to you now?

541
00:50:30,494 --> 00:50:31,893
Yes, I'll get him.

542
00:50:32,629 --> 00:50:33,527
Help!

543
00:50:43,206 --> 00:50:45,401
It's dangerous, he's got a grenade.

544
00:50:47,744 --> 00:50:52,841
Help!

545
00:51:00,290 --> 00:51:01,689
Oh Shit!

546
00:51:26,016 --> 00:51:27,415
Get Doctor Chang!

547
00:51:29,152 --> 00:51:31,347
Mind the way, excuse me!

548
00:51:32,756 --> 00:51:35,554
Oxygen, we need oxygen.

549
00:51:37,094 --> 00:51:37,890
Let's help him, alright?

550
00:51:38,028 --> 00:51:39,222
Hurry, why blood won't come?

551
00:51:42,899 --> 00:51:46,596
- Excuse me!
- Blood... hurry up!

552
00:51:48,071 --> 00:51:49,265
Come here, help me, hurry up!

553
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:51,834
Hold the salt water bottle, hurry up!

554
00:52:46,596 --> 00:52:48,393
We've got Ho's statement.

555
00:52:48,498 --> 00:52:49,795
Why can't we go and get Han now?

556
00:52:52,869 --> 00:52:54,359
Ho is dead.

557
00:52:54,504 --> 00:52:56,096
You go and alert Han now,

558
00:52:56,139 --> 00:52:58,334
he'll sue you like hell, idiot!

559
00:52:58,942 --> 00:53:02,935
That's true. Last year a guy
cheated so much money from the banks,

560
00:53:03,079 --> 00:53:04,774
but he was judged not guilty.

561
00:53:05,048 --> 00:53:06,345
It's a mess anyway.

562
00:53:19,462 --> 00:53:22,056
What is it? All your fathers died?

563
00:53:24,134 --> 00:53:25,431
This case is not over yet.

564
00:53:27,337 --> 00:53:28,634
Look at this.

565
00:53:31,641 --> 00:53:32,539
Powdered milk.

566
00:53:33,343 --> 00:53:35,937
That's right, what's wrong?

567
00:53:36,246 --> 00:53:38,339
If so many
can get killed over powdered milk,

568
00:53:39,049 --> 00:53:40,346
women wouldn't dare have children.

569
00:53:41,218 --> 00:53:42,515
Let's take it for tests.

570
00:54:01,137 --> 00:54:03,298
We have an informer in the police.

571
00:54:03,373 --> 00:54:07,002
You must help us find out
what this stuff is.

572
00:54:19,990 --> 00:54:22,390
What are these? Plant seeds.

573
00:54:31,067 --> 00:54:34,468
I'll let you know.

574
00:54:36,439 --> 00:54:38,634
It's urgent but you be careful.

575
00:54:39,042 --> 00:54:41,442
Nobody must know about it.

576
00:54:42,746 --> 00:54:44,941
I'll conduct the tests
when none is around.

577
00:54:54,224 --> 00:54:55,714
Call me when you have the results.

578
00:54:56,493 --> 00:54:58,586
I'll wait for your call.

579
00:55:00,130 --> 00:55:01,119
John.

580
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:05,459
Let's go. It's a family affair.

581
00:55:05,702 --> 00:55:06,600
Wait!

582
00:55:13,076 --> 00:55:15,010
This is your birthday gift to me.

583
00:55:16,346 --> 00:55:17,313
Do you want it back?

584
00:55:59,189 --> 00:56:01,384
I'll call you with the results.

585
00:56:01,691 --> 00:56:02,988
Just take care.

586
00:56:05,562 --> 00:56:06,654
I will.

587
00:56:08,064 --> 00:56:09,759
I hope I can help you break the case.

588
00:56:24,214 --> 00:56:26,114
He's back, quiet.

589
00:56:27,717 --> 00:56:30,015
These guys have really got guts.

590
00:56:31,221 --> 00:56:32,620
Following us again!

591
00:56:35,558 --> 00:56:38,049
What do we do?

592
00:56:38,261 --> 00:56:40,957
Calm down, they won't get away.

593
00:56:42,465 --> 00:56:44,160
Hawk calling H.Q., I'm P.C. Chan.

594
00:56:44,267 --> 00:56:46,258
According to the information,
we discovered the drug dealer.

595
00:56:46,369 --> 00:56:48,064
We must stick an eye on him, over.

596
00:56:59,082 --> 00:57:01,073
This is Inspector Wong.

597
00:57:01,251 --> 00:57:02,741
I'm going past Sheung Wan Street.

598
00:57:02,886 --> 00:57:05,354
One light brown 4-door sedan,

599
00:57:05,455 --> 00:57:07,855
registration B.T. 6041.

600
00:57:07,991 --> 00:57:09,982
4 suspects in the car.

601
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:12,560
We are proceeding to Wing Lok Street.

602
00:57:12,729 --> 00:57:14,663
Keep an eye on them, over!

603
00:57:23,840 --> 00:57:24,932
We've got to catch them today.

604
00:57:25,108 --> 00:57:26,097
Here they come.

605
00:57:47,030 --> 00:57:48,429
I've never had a gun fight yet.

606
00:57:48,531 --> 00:57:49,520
Shut the door and watch the fun.

607
00:57:59,008 --> 00:58:00,805
Looks like they're armed.

608
00:58:14,557 --> 00:58:15,581
They're armed.

609
00:58:15,725 --> 00:58:17,420
Get some help.

610
00:58:18,161 --> 00:58:20,061
Those inside do not move. We are C.I.D.

611
00:58:22,031 --> 00:58:24,329
We're C.I.D. Too.
Why are you following us?

612
00:58:24,634 --> 00:58:26,727
We'll shoot if you don't come out.

613
00:58:27,203 --> 00:58:30,695
Shit, whoever shoots first gets it.

614
00:58:35,278 --> 00:58:36,575
Get down!

615
00:58:41,050 --> 00:58:42,347
Put your I.D. Away.

616
00:58:42,952 --> 00:58:43,850
They are getting out their guns.

617
00:58:51,194 --> 00:58:54,595
Kam, Ong, don't shoot.
Someone is playing a bad joke on us.

618
00:58:54,731 --> 00:58:56,130
Kam, Ong!

619
00:58:59,435 --> 00:59:00,527
Really C.I.D.'s.

620
00:59:04,841 --> 00:59:05,933
How are you?

621
00:59:33,803 --> 00:59:35,998
- A gun fight!
- This serious?

622
00:59:36,706 --> 00:59:38,105
Someone was lying in wait for us.

623
00:59:38,274 --> 00:59:40,572
- Attack the police? Seal the place!
- Yes, sir!

624
00:59:40,677 --> 00:59:42,577
Looks like guys from the next district.

625
00:59:42,779 --> 00:59:45,873
Bad luck for them,
barging in on us like this.

626
00:59:55,258 --> 00:59:56,748
You jerks come up with something new
each day.

627
00:59:56,893 --> 00:59:58,588
Don't let news of this get out.

628
00:59:58,728 --> 01:00:01,526
Or it will make the top 10 charts.

629
01:00:01,631 --> 01:00:04,896
Our crime unit says
someone is following them,

630
01:00:06,135 --> 01:00:09,662
someone gave us a tip-off
to follow your guys, Sir!

631
01:00:10,707 --> 01:00:13,107
- Tell them all to come out. Now.
- Yes, Sir!

632
01:00:13,409 --> 01:00:15,502
All of you inside come out.

633
01:00:16,479 --> 01:00:18,970
This is Ng. Don't come out.

634
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:26,411
How can you guarantee your guys
won't attack my guys.

635
01:00:26,623 --> 01:00:29,114
If my guys were to shoot,
your guys can't come out.

636
01:00:29,292 --> 01:00:30,884
I guarantee their safety.

637
01:00:31,294 --> 01:00:32,488
O.K.

638
01:00:33,196 --> 01:00:34,993
I'm Law from Central.

639
01:00:35,198 --> 01:00:36,790
Our guys come out.

640
01:01:00,256 --> 01:01:02,554
Who started the shooting?

641
01:01:02,725 --> 01:01:04,784
I'll put this in my report,
you just wait.

642
01:01:08,598 --> 01:01:09,895
I fired the first shot.

643
01:01:11,234 --> 01:01:14,465
People like you ruin the police's image.

644
01:01:23,413 --> 01:01:26,246
Do you think that Peter arranged this.

645
01:01:37,126 --> 01:01:38,423
Isn't that Ching Han?

646
01:01:48,104 --> 01:01:49,799
Inspector Wong, pleased to meet you.

647
01:01:54,544 --> 01:01:55,636
How are you?

648
01:01:56,179 --> 01:01:58,272
I hear your gang is very thorough, good!

649
01:02:04,253 --> 01:02:08,246
Hong Kong has only 10 years left,
not much time.

650
01:02:08,858 --> 01:02:10,655
How can we make a living
if we are not thorough.

651
01:02:11,661 --> 01:02:12,855
You know we are investigating you.

652
01:02:12,962 --> 01:02:15,396
You have your hands on my shoulders,
wanna deal?

653
01:02:17,633 --> 01:02:20,329
I don't know about deals.

654
01:02:21,904 --> 01:02:23,496
I knew you'd come looking for me.

655
01:02:24,173 --> 01:02:25,868
That's why I've come voluntarily.

656
01:02:26,209 --> 01:02:28,404
Go ahead, ask.
I'll try my best to answer.

657
01:02:28,911 --> 01:02:32,403
The answers you can give
are probably not good enough.

658
01:02:34,751 --> 01:02:36,742
No hurry, I'll be looking for you.

659
01:02:37,186 --> 01:02:40,849
Don't get a ticket for Seattle
when the time comes.

660
01:02:40,890 --> 01:02:43,085
You dropped something.

661
01:02:43,426 --> 01:02:44,825
Take it home and look it over.

662
01:03:02,712 --> 01:03:05,681
I don't know which beggar
threw that dirty money away.

663
01:03:13,122 --> 01:03:14,521
Tell him to go eat shit.

664
01:03:56,899 --> 01:03:58,196
Did you see that face!

665
01:03:58,401 --> 01:04:00,699
Watching us throw his money away.

666
01:04:00,803 --> 01:04:02,600
- What fun!
- Fun, eh!

667
01:04:02,672 --> 01:04:05,539
My heart broke when I saw that money go.

668
01:04:25,428 --> 01:04:28,022
You can't suspend me now.

669
01:04:28,130 --> 01:04:29,722
I'm nearly there.

670
01:04:29,899 --> 01:04:31,196
Let me go on.

671
01:04:31,334 --> 01:04:33,529
How can there be
suddenly $300,000 in my bank?

672
01:04:33,636 --> 01:04:35,126
Someone is setting me up.

673
01:04:36,205 --> 01:04:38,105
Sorry, I.C.A.C. Is after you.

674
01:04:38,441 --> 01:04:40,238
Even then, I don't need to be suspended.

675
01:04:40,276 --> 01:04:42,574
When will we get enough evidence
to get Han?

676
01:04:42,712 --> 01:04:44,805
You talk to the I.C.A.C.

677
01:04:45,047 --> 01:04:47,447
Just give me one more month.

678
01:04:47,583 --> 01:04:49,278
Otherwise
all my work goes down the drain.

679
01:04:49,452 --> 01:04:50,111
Superintendent, Wong...

680
01:04:50,152 --> 01:04:51,346
Anymore from you,
you get an investigation too.

681
01:04:52,455 --> 01:04:55,049
Lun, don't mess about. I'll fix the boss.

682
01:05:00,029 --> 01:05:01,929
Ho was murdered at the hospital.

683
01:05:02,832 --> 01:05:03,821
This case is not finished yet.

684
01:05:03,966 --> 01:05:06,730
You'll be busy at the Courts
all the time.

685
01:05:14,443 --> 01:05:15,774
Don't go on investigating this month.

686
01:05:15,912 --> 01:05:17,402
I've got to make a call.

687
01:05:20,049 --> 01:05:21,846
Lun, Maggie called.

688
01:05:21,951 --> 01:05:23,248
- Go and see what it is.
- OK.

689
01:05:35,264 --> 01:05:37,164
Hello, Maggie, Lun here.

690
01:05:37,466 --> 01:05:40,629
I've got it, it's cocaine seeds.

691
01:05:40,736 --> 01:05:42,431
After refinement, it becomes heroin.

692
01:05:42,571 --> 01:05:44,869
I'll tell Inspector Wong!

693
01:07:33,282 --> 01:07:34,476
One and half minutes left.

694
01:07:35,117 --> 01:07:36,015
Throw it out the window.

695
01:07:38,721 --> 01:07:40,211
No, there are pedestrians.

696
01:07:40,923 --> 01:07:42,322
- There's building site there.
- Excuse me!

697
01:07:43,659 --> 01:07:46,150
- Move over!
- Excuse...

698
01:07:46,962 --> 01:07:48,156
This way! Hurry up!

699
01:07:51,634 --> 01:07:52,623
Excuse...

700
01:07:53,836 --> 01:07:56,737
- That's way! Hurry up!
- What do you do?

701
01:08:00,509 --> 01:08:01,908
Calling H. Q!

702
01:08:03,012 --> 01:08:04,001
Move off!

703
01:08:04,780 --> 01:08:05,974
I'll shoot if you don't stop.

704
01:08:06,615 --> 01:08:07,604
What is it?

705
01:08:09,552 --> 01:08:10,450
Hurry up!

706
01:08:11,854 --> 01:08:13,151
I'm C.I. D!

707
01:08:20,596 --> 01:08:21,585
Move off!

708
01:08:23,732 --> 01:08:26,223
Don't run... l'll shoot.

709
01:08:45,154 --> 01:08:46,451
You're idiot!

710
01:08:48,624 --> 01:08:49,682
Are you O.K. Kam?

711
01:08:50,226 --> 01:08:54,322
You're right, I'm slow.

712
01:08:54,463 --> 01:08:57,364
To let that old soldier shoot me,
shit on shit.

713
01:08:58,100 --> 01:08:59,089
You...

714
01:09:00,469 --> 01:09:02,061
My mother is really stubborn.

715
01:09:02,171 --> 01:09:03,866
She mustn't know I'm shot.

716
01:09:12,748 --> 01:09:15,581
Kam...

717
01:09:19,488 --> 01:09:23,083
Do you know where my son Kam is?

718
01:09:23,292 --> 01:09:25,692
The cop with the bad temper?

719
01:09:25,794 --> 01:09:27,284
Right, where is he?

720
01:09:27,496 --> 01:09:31,694
- In bed number 52.
- Thank you! Kam!

721
01:09:33,235 --> 01:09:34,429
Oh Shit!

722
01:10:02,831 --> 01:10:05,129
- Who shall I say it's from?
- Waipong Wong?

723
01:10:05,401 --> 01:10:08,097
- How much?
- Waipong Wong, $200.

724
01:10:55,417 --> 01:10:58,614
Attention! Start!

725
01:11:15,170 --> 01:11:18,435
John! You have to go to Court tomorrow.

726
01:11:24,980 --> 01:11:26,675
I'm going back to K.L. Tomorrow.

727
01:11:27,182 --> 01:11:29,275
Your boss reported on me to my boss.

728
01:11:30,085 --> 01:11:32,076
H.Q. Wants me back.

729
01:11:34,757 --> 01:11:37,248
Can't send you off.

730
01:11:38,060 --> 01:11:39,550
- Take care!
- I will!

731
01:11:42,264 --> 01:11:43,663
Sorry! Wong!

732
01:11:43,866 --> 01:11:46,562
I don't know
whether it's the right time to resign.

733
01:11:47,002 --> 01:11:49,402
My mother is afraid I'll get killed.

734
01:11:51,373 --> 01:11:53,068
She needs me to take care of her.

735
01:11:57,112 --> 01:11:59,307
Don't worry, I'll fix it.

736
01:12:00,683 --> 01:12:02,674
If you need help, anytime.

737
01:12:05,154 --> 01:12:08,146
"The Supreme Court"

738
01:12:08,457 --> 01:12:11,358
Do you have any comments
on this investigation?

739
01:12:11,560 --> 01:12:12,652
Sorry, no comments.

740
01:12:12,995 --> 01:12:14,087
Mr. Han!

741
01:12:14,430 --> 01:12:16,057
How come you're involved in this?

742
01:12:16,131 --> 01:12:17,325
Actually decent businessmen like me,

743
01:12:17,466 --> 01:12:19,866
hate law keepers who are corrupt. Sorry!

744
01:12:21,470 --> 01:12:23,461
I never knew
we'd see one another in Court.

745
01:12:24,206 --> 01:12:26,504
But you're not after me, I'm after you.

746
01:12:27,476 --> 01:12:31,173
Frankly,
this is your chance to go straight.

747
01:12:31,513 --> 01:12:33,003
I feel sorry for you too.

748
01:12:34,717 --> 01:12:37,117
I've always doubted Hong Kong's law,

749
01:12:37,586 --> 01:12:39,781
but a lot of people
are wasting good time,

750
01:12:39,988 --> 01:12:42,479
nowadays studying basic law,
actually there is no law.

751
01:12:43,092 --> 01:12:44,286
Small matter.

752
01:12:44,493 --> 01:12:47,587
Spend a few years inside. Start again.

753
01:12:47,930 --> 01:12:49,329
Don't worry. Nothing will happen.

754
01:12:49,665 --> 01:12:51,860
Any problems, call me.

755
01:13:07,416 --> 01:13:08,610
You bastard.

756
01:13:24,199 --> 01:13:29,102
- Don't fight!
- Let him go!

757
01:13:30,005 --> 01:13:31,404
- Bastard!
- Don't fight!

758
01:13:32,241 --> 01:13:34,038
Excuse me! Don't fight!

759
01:13:35,444 --> 01:13:39,039
Let me go, I'll beat him to death.

760
01:13:42,651 --> 01:13:44,642
Don't bother, kid.
You need some vitamin pills.

761
01:13:46,455 --> 01:13:47,353
Let's go!

762
01:13:49,291 --> 01:13:50,690
Don't you leave.

763
01:13:50,859 --> 01:13:52,759
- There are reporters here.
- Let me go!

764
01:13:52,961 --> 01:13:56,863
- Don't fail for it!
- I can't live with it.

765
01:13:58,333 --> 01:14:00,028
If this is what a cop's life is, I quit.

766
01:14:00,636 --> 01:14:03,537
- Lun!
- Lun. Kwok Keung Lun!

767
01:14:05,741 --> 01:14:07,732
Lun. Kwok Keung Lun!

768
01:14:11,313 --> 01:14:13,110
- Where are you off to?
- Come on!

769
01:14:15,651 --> 01:14:19,246
Lun...

770
01:14:36,572 --> 01:14:37,470
$15!

771
01:14:41,910 --> 01:14:45,004
That's right. Just let it blow over.

772
01:14:45,214 --> 01:14:46,408
Love forever!

773
01:14:53,455 --> 01:14:56,856
- $58.
- Miss! Give me a lighter.

774
01:14:57,292 --> 01:14:58,486
- O. K!
- $15.

775
01:15:08,203 --> 01:15:09,295
What is it?

776
01:15:09,505 --> 01:15:11,097
Notify Inspector Wong and Kam.

777
01:15:11,240 --> 01:15:13,435
Tell them to wait, I've got a new clue.

778
01:15:41,803 --> 01:15:42,701
Let's go!

779
01:15:43,105 --> 01:15:45,005
At least you have to tell me where to go.

780
01:15:45,173 --> 01:15:46,572
I'm C.I.D. Follow that Rolls Royce.

781
01:15:47,009 --> 01:15:48,101
After some robbers?

782
01:15:56,952 --> 01:15:58,249
Where did you go?

783
01:15:58,320 --> 01:15:59,218
Don't ask me to do dangerous things.

784
01:15:59,354 --> 01:16:01,549
You take the car,
I'll get it back from police station.

785
01:16:42,998 --> 01:16:46,365
You bungled the job,
the cargo nearly didn't go out.

786
01:16:46,535 --> 01:16:47,934
It will be even more inconvenient.

787
01:16:48,003 --> 01:16:49,300
The police are watching us.

788
01:16:49,972 --> 01:16:52,463
Our transport network in S.E. Asia,

789
01:16:52,641 --> 01:16:54,734
has been completely destroyed by you.

790
01:16:55,911 --> 01:16:57,606
Ching Han, you are a man of resources,

791
01:16:57,746 --> 01:16:59,737
now there's a problem, what then?

792
01:17:00,048 --> 01:17:03,449
Mr. Molotov,
Hong Kong will be handed over soon,

793
01:17:04,853 --> 01:17:06,946
many are waiting to emigrate.

794
01:17:07,489 --> 01:17:08,387
They need money.

795
01:17:08,557 --> 01:17:09,956
I agree with you.

796
01:17:10,125 --> 01:17:12,320
This is the time to grab money.

797
01:17:12,494 --> 01:17:13,791
As long as we pay the price,

798
01:17:13,962 --> 01:17:15,156
not to mention drugs,

799
01:17:15,297 --> 01:17:17,322
you can ship
the entire Hong Kong to your country.

800
01:17:17,532 --> 01:17:20,433
This list are high government officials.

801
01:17:20,535 --> 01:17:21,832
Yes, we spent some money,

802
01:17:21,937 --> 01:17:23,427
but compared to our profits,

803
01:17:23,605 --> 01:17:27,006
this investment is peanuts.

804
01:17:30,612 --> 01:17:33,206
Traveler Chat Fu Ong,
who took flight 071 to Malaysia,

805
01:17:33,382 --> 01:17:37,079
please contact
the airport enquiry center.

806
01:17:39,087 --> 01:17:43,080
You're right.
Everybody looks to money now.

807
01:17:43,291 --> 01:17:47,887
Selling drugs and capitalism together
is the best way.

808
01:17:48,530 --> 01:17:51,226
Let's drink to 1997.

809
01:17:51,333 --> 01:17:53,733
- Cheers!
- To greater success.

810
01:18:10,819 --> 01:18:12,514
Mr. Han,
that rookie has followed us here.

811
01:19:01,536 --> 01:19:02,434
Freeze!

812
01:19:03,672 --> 01:19:05,640
Trying to scare somebody?

813
01:19:06,842 --> 01:19:08,742
- Have you called Inspector Wong!
- He'll be here soon.

814
01:19:09,644 --> 01:19:11,942
I've recorded Han's meeting.

815
01:19:12,080 --> 01:19:14,071
He's moving drugs for the Russians.

816
01:19:14,249 --> 01:19:15,841
Han's nailed this time.

817
01:19:19,888 --> 01:19:20,980
Lun!

818
01:19:23,191 --> 01:19:24,283
It's that guy.

819
01:19:35,937 --> 01:19:37,336
Can't call out.

820
01:19:42,878 --> 01:19:44,277
Go through that window.

821
01:19:47,015 --> 01:19:48,312
Jump down, quick.

822
01:19:52,888 --> 01:19:54,185
And give the tape to Inspector Wong!

823
01:21:02,991 --> 01:21:06,256
How come your face can be cut by a blade?

824
01:21:06,695 --> 01:21:08,595
I thought it was made of steel.

825
01:21:09,030 --> 01:21:11,021
I despise stupid people like you.

826
01:21:11,132 --> 01:21:12,724
You do not treasure your life.

827
01:21:14,269 --> 01:21:16,066
You go all the way each time,

828
01:21:16,605 --> 01:21:19,403
with no ulterior motive, no gains.

829
01:21:19,841 --> 01:21:21,536
I don't know for what.

830
01:21:22,410 --> 01:21:26,540
I thought stubborn people like you
have already become extinct.

831
01:21:29,618 --> 01:21:31,518
Mr. Han, we found the tape.

832
01:21:31,720 --> 01:21:32,618
Other than the kid,

833
01:21:32,721 --> 01:21:35,121
others must know our secret too.

834
01:21:40,195 --> 01:21:43,687
Pity, bad enough for you.

835
01:21:45,133 --> 01:21:48,125
Why did you get others involved?

836
01:21:48,870 --> 01:21:54,775
You want a quick death,
tell me who's heard this tape before.

837
01:22:08,890 --> 01:22:10,084
The janitor is dead.

838
01:22:58,907 --> 01:22:59,896
Lun!

839
01:23:00,208 --> 01:23:01,607
Don't, Lun!

840
01:23:01,743 --> 01:23:05,144
- Let me go!
- Don't go over there.

841
01:23:05,513 --> 01:23:08,414
- Lun...
- Sir.

842
01:23:18,460 --> 01:23:20,257
Lun!

843
01:23:21,930 --> 01:23:25,627
Lun!

844
01:23:36,344 --> 01:23:37,140
Let's go!

845
01:24:20,422 --> 01:24:21,320
Hide.

846
01:24:30,465 --> 01:24:31,454
Cari mati!

847
01:24:37,872 --> 01:24:38,668
Let's go!

848
01:24:41,876 --> 01:24:42,865
That's way!

849
01:24:44,045 --> 01:24:47,139
Kam...

850
01:26:56,444 --> 01:26:57,536
Hurry!

851
01:27:31,479 --> 01:27:32,776
I'll smash you to death.

852
01:27:54,168 --> 01:27:55,260
Don't release the pedal.

853
01:28:04,112 --> 01:28:05,306
Jump, we're crashing.

854
01:28:29,103 --> 01:28:31,196
- Are you O. K?
- No problem!

855
01:29:21,489 --> 01:29:23,980
You bastard, go to hell!

856
01:29:43,211 --> 01:29:44,906
Few years later will be 1997.

857
01:29:45,012 --> 01:29:47,412
Many people are waiting for immigration.

858
01:29:47,582 --> 01:29:48,674
They need money.

859
01:29:48,816 --> 01:29:50,215
I agree with you.

860
01:29:50,385 --> 01:29:52,580
We should take this time
and earn some money.

861
01:29:52,720 --> 01:29:54,517
As long as we can pay for it,

862
01:29:54,689 --> 01:29:55,883
not only smuggling drug,

863
01:29:55,957 --> 01:29:58,255
I can smuggle everything in Hong Kong
to your place.

864
01:29:58,393 --> 01:30:01,487
People in the list
are important people in the government.

865
01:30:31,292 --> 01:30:33,487
We never found out who's on Han's list.

866
01:30:33,628 --> 01:30:36,119
But the drugs leaving Hong Kong
were found by the Marine Police.

867
01:30:36,297 --> 01:30:38,492
At least your efforts were not wasted.

868
01:30:48,676 --> 01:30:51,167
The doctor says my stitches
will be removed next month.

869
01:30:51,379 --> 01:30:52,869
I want to apply to be with you.

870
01:30:53,080 --> 01:30:54,479
I thought you wanted to quit.

871
01:30:54,649 --> 01:30:55,547
On second thoughts,

872
01:30:55,683 --> 01:30:58,481
in this world,
it would be safer to carry a gun.

873
01:31:09,797 --> 01:31:12,789
Excuse me, which one is Inspector Wong?

874
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:14,797
I've been transferred from
the Western District.

875
01:31:14,969 --> 01:31:16,994
Number 1003, Chuchia Butt!

876
01:31:17,238 --> 01:31:19,433
Don't know where he's...

877
01:31:19,607 --> 01:31:20,301
I am Waipong Wong!

878
01:31:20,441 --> 01:31:21,931
We'll talk about it back in the station.

879
01:31:22,109 --> 01:31:22,905
Yes, Sir!

880
01:31:25,580 --> 01:31:27,980
This car, don't you want your own car?

881
01:31:28,182 --> 01:31:29,080
No, sir!

882
01:31:29,717 --> 01:31:32,015
Working with this long-haired weirdo,
shit!

883
01:31:37,625 --> 01:31:39,616
Wait me!
