1
00:01:14,474 --> 00:01:16,533
In the 49th year of Kang Xi's reign

2
00:01:16,643 --> 00:01:18,611
It was the 11th month

3
00:01:18,711 --> 00:01:21,202
Emperor Kang Xi escorted the Queen Mother

4
00:01:21,314 --> 00:01:24,875
To stay in the Summer Resort in Changde

5
00:01:24,984 --> 00:01:27,282
Accompanying them were Prince Yunnai

6
00:01:27,387 --> 00:01:30,185
Prince Yong,4th son of the Emperor

7
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:34,420
And many imperial concubines and princes

8
00:01:35,428 --> 00:01:37,919
The Summer Resort has an area
of 16 square miles

9
00:01:38,031 --> 00:01:39,726
With a lake on its left and mountains
on its right

10
00:01:39,833 --> 00:01:42,358
The mountains stretch from north to west

11
00:01:42,469 --> 00:01:47,304
With green valleys and pine forests

12
00:01:47,407 --> 00:01:50,205
And verdant paths with scenic views

13
00:01:51,244 --> 00:01:53,235
A waterfall comes from a valley
of the west

14
00:01:53,346 --> 00:01:55,906
It starts from the tip of an emerald rock

15
00:01:56,015 --> 00:01:59,917
And is streaming down to the lake

16
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:04,651
Seemingly harnessed over the lake
is a rainbow bridge

17
00:02:04,757 --> 00:02:06,122
It is a scenic delight

18
00:02:15,835 --> 00:02:19,737
On the 11th day of the 11 month,
the Emperor

19
00:02:19,839 --> 00:02:21,773
went to hunt with Prince Yunnai
and Prince Yong

20
00:02:21,875 --> 00:02:23,467
During a hunting chase in Mulan

21
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:22,032
Don't kill it

22
00:03:22,335 --> 00:03:23,495
Seems like it can't survive

23
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:25,334
Don't waste the good stuff

24
00:03:25,438 --> 00:03:27,497
Drink its blood while it's still alive

25
00:03:27,607 --> 00:03:28,039
Deer blood£¿

26
00:03:28,141 --> 00:03:30,234
It's good stuff,gives you energy

27
00:03:30,343 --> 00:03:31,605
Makes you strong and live long

28
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:32,643
Good

29
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:34,243
Kill it

30
00:03:45,858 --> 00:03:46,916
Drink it while it's still hot

31
00:03:47,026 --> 00:03:47,924
The fresher the better

32
00:03:48,428 --> 00:03:49,725
What to do after having this good stuff£¿

33
00:03:49,829 --> 00:03:51,888
After having this,you¡­

34
00:03:54,567 --> 00:03:55,591
Nonsense

35
00:04:01,007 --> 00:04:03,100
It's a bit smelly

36
00:04:03,209 --> 00:04:06,406
Deer blood smells,human flesh
has a sour taste

37
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:07,978
Human flesh is sour£¿

38
00:04:08,414 --> 00:04:10,348
What£¿ You ate human flesh before£¿

39
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:11,576
Why not£¿

40
00:04:11,684 --> 00:04:13,914
Everyone who went to war with the Emperor

41
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:16,853
has tasted human flesh and horse piss

42
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:20,191
But not all human flesh is sour

43
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:35,272
Here's a sweet one coming

44
00:05:05,505 --> 00:05:07,063
Who give you permission to hunt here£¿

45
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:14,175
Tell me,who give you permission
to hunt here£¿

46
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:15,304
What£¿

47
00:05:16,849 --> 00:05:18,441
You raise these deer£¿

48
00:05:18,551 --> 00:05:19,848
Of course not

49
00:05:19,952 --> 00:05:21,783
But I'm in charge of all the deer in Mulan

50
00:05:21,888 --> 00:05:24,857
Tell me,who give you permission
to hunt here£¿

51
00:05:24,957 --> 00:05:26,254
My old man

52
00:05:26,359 --> 00:05:27,758
Your old man£¿

53
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:28,451
Why your old man can give you permission

54
00:05:28,561 --> 00:05:30,392
to hunt in this place£¿

55
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:32,488
Don't you know the Emperor forbids

56
00:05:32,598 --> 00:05:35,226
hunting within 200 miles of Mulan£¿

57
00:05:35,735 --> 00:05:40,195
Sure,no one is allowed to hunt here

58
00:05:40,306 --> 00:05:41,933
Except me

59
00:05:42,508 --> 00:05:44,169
That doesn't make sense

60
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:47,074
Why the hell would you be allowed
to hunt here£¿

61
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:51,146
It is because¡­

62
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:52,979
the order is given by my old man

63
00:05:59,392 --> 00:06:00,882
Come and meet Prince Yong

64
00:06:02,929 --> 00:06:05,295
Your Highness,here's your humble maid
Lijia

65
00:06:06,733 --> 00:06:10,032
My lord,she's rude and has offended you

66
00:06:11,804 --> 00:06:12,793
Get up¡­

67
00:06:26,152 --> 00:06:30,987
Lijia,you're a member of the Han clan,
right£¿

68
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:32,085
Yes

69
00:06:33,559 --> 00:06:34,685
Where do you live£¿

70
00:06:35,294 --> 00:06:37,956
The cottage next to the stable

71
00:06:39,499 --> 00:06:40,898
So you're in charge of
the imperial stable£¿

72
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:41,898
Yes

73
00:07:19,705 --> 00:07:20,399
Your Highness

74
00:07:20,506 --> 00:07:21,473
Get up¡­

75
00:07:36,255 --> 00:07:37,222
Your Highness

76
00:07:53,539 --> 00:07:54,563
Your Highness

77
00:08:07,687 --> 00:08:08,711
In the 8th month the following year

78
00:08:08,821 --> 00:08:10,254
News of stable maid Lijia's pregnancy

79
00:08:10,356 --> 00:08:12,722
Has spread through the Summer Resort

80
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:15,089
The Resort was guarded as heavily as
the Palace

81
00:08:15,194 --> 00:08:16,491
Then who's the baby's father£¿

82
00:08:16,596 --> 00:08:18,860
Emperor Kang Xi was indignant

83
00:08:23,302 --> 00:08:25,497
It must be him

84
00:08:25,605 --> 00:08:26,469
Summon Prince Yong

85
00:08:26,572 --> 00:08:27,300
Yes

86
00:08:38,384 --> 00:08:42,787
According to Vol.247 of Kang Xi's
Chronicles

87
00:08:42,889 --> 00:08:44,288
In the 50th year of Kang Xi's reign

88
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:48,793
which happened to be the 6th month
of 1 71 1A.D

89
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:53,764
Prince Yong went to Rehe
to visit his father

90
00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:56,892
The visit was only an excuse

91
00:08:57,003 --> 00:09:00,734
In fact Kang Xi had known about
Lijia's pregnancy

92
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,000
And was indignant

93
00:09:02,108 --> 00:09:04,542
He reprimanded Prince Yong

94
00:09:04,644 --> 00:09:07,636
And Lijia was not allowed to
give birth in the palace

95
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:09,038
On the 13th day of the 8th month

96
00:09:09,148 --> 00:09:10,877
A kind old palace maid

97
00:09:10,983 --> 00:09:12,951
Secretly helped Lijia to give birth

98
00:09:13,819 --> 00:09:18,051
Prince Yong's 4th son was born at midnight

99
00:09:18,157 --> 00:09:21,354
Among the 208 emperors in Chinese history

100
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:23,485
He was the only one who lived to be 89

101
00:09:23,596 --> 00:09:24,893
He had ruled for sixty years

102
00:09:24,997 --> 00:09:27,124
And gave his throne to his heir
after he retired

103
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:31,192
He was Emperor Chien Lung

104
00:09:48,154 --> 00:09:51,180
In the 59th year of Kang Xi's reign

105
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:53,349
The Emperor was 65

106
00:09:53,459 --> 00:09:57,020
And was still looking for an heir
to his throne

107
00:09:57,129 --> 00:10:00,621
So worried was he that his hair
turned grey

108
00:10:00,733 --> 00:10:02,030
An unexpected incident happened

109
00:10:02,134 --> 00:10:04,102
during this hunting trip

110
00:10:04,203 --> 00:10:05,363
During a group hunt

111
00:10:05,471 --> 00:10:08,406
a ferocious black bear appeared

112
00:10:21,721 --> 00:10:23,450
Your Majesty

113
00:10:36,035 --> 00:10:37,900
Your grandson Hongli kowtows to you

114
00:10:38,004 --> 00:10:40,472
May my grandfather live
many thousands of years

115
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:49,905
Hongli£¿ Who's Hongli£¿

116
00:10:50,016 --> 00:10:54,350
Your Majesty,he's the 4th son
of Prince Yong

117
00:10:54,453 --> 00:10:56,512
The one who was born in Mulan

118
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,388
Good

119
00:11:14,974 --> 00:11:15,998
Good

120
00:11:41,434 --> 00:11:41,957
Hongli

121
00:11:42,068 --> 00:11:42,727
I'm here

122
00:11:42,835 --> 00:11:44,598
You're raised outside the lmperial Palace

123
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:46,797
and have good martial and
equestrian skills

124
00:11:46,906 --> 00:11:49,204
Have you started learning yet£¿

125
00:11:49,308 --> 00:11:50,639
I started learning at four

126
00:11:50,743 --> 00:11:52,643
I could recite some classic at six

127
00:11:53,412 --> 00:11:55,243
Do you know how to make couplets£¿

128
00:11:55,347 --> 00:11:56,405
A little bit

129
00:11:56,515 --> 00:11:59,279
Good,I'll make the first part and
you the next

130
00:11:59,385 --> 00:11:59,976
Yes

131
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:07,018
What's the matter£¿

132
00:12:07,126 --> 00:12:09,185
You know how to make couplets£¿
Want to try£¿

133
00:12:09,295 --> 00:12:11,092
It's easy. You do it first

134
00:12:12,598 --> 00:12:13,565
I say ¡°up¡±

135
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:15,190
I say ¡°down¡±

136
00:12:15,301 --> 00:12:15,995
I say ¡°big¡±

137
00:12:16,102 --> 00:12:17,763
I say ¡°small¡±

138
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:18,461
I say ¡°man¡±

139
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:19,333
I say ¡°dog¡±

140
00:12:20,106 --> 00:12:21,937
I am ¡°big man up¡± here

141
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:23,167
I am ¡°small dog down¡± below

142
00:12:25,044 --> 00:12:27,171
Hey you,you¡­

143
00:12:35,321 --> 00:12:36,151
Listen

144
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:37,085
Yes

145
00:12:37,189 --> 00:12:39,714
A four-sided pavilion has four sides

146
00:12:39,825 --> 00:12:43,056
Look out the four sides from
the four-sided pavilion

147
00:12:43,162 --> 00:12:46,529
All four sides are covering
the four directions

148
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:55,430
Long life to my grandpa who lived long

149
00:12:55,541 --> 00:12:57,566
Wishing longevity to the one
who lived long

150
00:12:57,676 --> 00:13:00,042
Long live long live to the one
who lived long

151
00:13:30,543 --> 00:13:31,942
Your humble maid Lijia

152
00:13:32,044 --> 00:13:34,706
Kowtows to Your Majesty

153
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:35,803
Arise

154
00:13:35,915 --> 00:13:36,973
Thank you,Your Majesty

155
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:20,416
It's too shabby here

156
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:23,524
A small hill is famous for
the fairies living there

157
00:14:23,629 --> 00:14:26,120
A small pond is known for
the dragons it has

158
00:14:26,232 --> 00:14:29,030
A shabby room is decorated with my virtues

159
00:14:29,134 --> 00:14:31,796
There's green grass and moss outside

160
00:14:31,904 --> 00:14:34,372
inside there are scholars but not laymen

161
00:14:34,473 --> 00:14:35,667
This is far from shabby

162
00:14:36,275 --> 00:14:39,335
It sounds ambitious at our age

163
00:14:39,445 --> 00:14:42,209
Grandpa,everyone in this room is either

164
00:14:42,314 --> 00:14:45,715
Of imperial descent or high officials

165
00:14:45,818 --> 00:14:47,979
There's no commoners here

166
00:14:48,354 --> 00:14:49,184
You're right

167
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:12,167
You can play the qin and read
Buddhist scriptures

168
00:15:12,678 --> 00:15:18,048
Life in this room is quiet and relaxed

169
00:15:19,285 --> 00:15:24,780
Good,this analogy is precise and exact

170
00:15:28,527 --> 00:15:29,152
Come here

171
00:15:29,261 --> 00:15:30,125
Yes

172
00:15:31,964 --> 00:15:32,726
Tell me

173
00:15:32,831 --> 00:15:36,096
What are the eight major families of Qing£¿

174
00:15:36,201 --> 00:15:37,429
Yes

175
00:15:37,536 --> 00:15:38,628
The Gua'erjia family

176
00:15:38,737 --> 00:15:39,965
The Shumulu family

177
00:15:40,072 --> 00:15:41,061
The Bangla family

178
00:15:41,173 --> 00:15:42,538
The Dong'e family

179
00:15:42,641 --> 00:15:44,199
The Majia family

180
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:46,244

181
00:15:46,345 --> 00:15:47,607
The Huifa family

182
00:15:47,713 --> 00:15:49,408
And the Niugulu family

183
00:15:49,815 --> 00:15:50,839
Is that all£¿

184
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:51,678
Yes

185
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:54,252
I grant the family name Niugulu to Lijia

186
00:15:54,753 --> 00:15:57,517
When I go back to Beijing with
the Queen Mother

187
00:15:57,623 --> 00:16:02,287
Hongli and Niugulu should accompany me

188
00:16:02,394 --> 00:16:03,918
And move into Prince Yong's mansion

189
00:16:04,029 --> 00:16:05,189
Yes,Your Majesty

190
00:16:08,067 --> 00:16:09,261
Thank you,Your Majesty

191
00:16:14,273 --> 00:16:17,401
In 61 st year of Kang Xi's reign,
on 13th November

192
00:16:17,509 --> 00:16:18,840
Kang Xi passed away in the evening

193
00:16:18,944 --> 00:16:21,469
¡­in Changchun Garden

194
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:23,707
In the same year,on 20th day
of 1 1th month

195
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:26,216
Prince Yong became heir to the throne

196
00:16:26,318 --> 00:16:29,082
After having reigned for thirteen years

197
00:16:29,188 --> 00:16:32,555
he made Hongli his heir

198
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:34,683
Hongli's title was Chien Lung

199
00:16:34,793 --> 00:16:37,956
He remained as an emperor for sixty years

200
00:16:38,063 --> 00:16:42,500
It was a golden era of the Qing dynasty

201
00:16:42,601 --> 00:16:44,592
He had won ten wars

202
00:16:44,703 --> 00:16:47,433
And thus called himself
¡°Old Man of Perfect Ten¡±

203
00:16:51,944 --> 00:16:54,913
Now in the Palace Museum in Taipei

204
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:57,380
this is Chien Lung's Diadem

205
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:04,689
Mala beads and the queen's
phoenix headdress

206
00:17:06,658 --> 00:17:09,456
And these are Chien Lung's snuff bottles

207
00:17:09,561 --> 00:17:11,392
and his treasure box

208
00:17:12,431 --> 00:17:14,524
It is said that Chien Lung had
collected tens and

209
00:17:14,633 --> 00:17:17,329
thousands of treasure pieces like these

210
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:22,507
Chien Lung liked antiques and paintings

211
00:17:22,608 --> 00:17:25,634
He had composed volumes of poems
and lyrics

212
00:17:25,744 --> 00:17:28,645
Some of them might be written by
his ministers

213
00:17:28,747 --> 00:17:31,807
He was really an emperor of arts

214
00:17:35,821 --> 00:17:40,019
These are part of his seals and stationery

215
00:17:42,394 --> 00:17:45,363
Chien Lung's greatest contribution
to literature was£º

216

Chief EditorJi Xiaolan¡­

238
00:18:52,631 --> 00:18:57,728
led the team to complete
the editorial work

239
00:18:57,836 --> 00:18:59,861
ofthis classic collection and an index

240
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:03,806
¡­to the entire collection

241
00:19:03,909 --> 00:19:06,901
Ji was a great scholar of
the Chien Lung era

242
00:19:07,012 --> 00:19:09,378
His works included
¡°Notes from Yuewei Hall¡± etc

243
00:19:09,481 --> 00:19:13,281
He was humorous and eloquent

244
00:19:13,385 --> 00:19:15,819
The eunuchs always wanted a story from him

245
00:19:29,401 --> 00:19:30,231
Master Ji

246
00:19:30,335 --> 00:19:31,199
Hmm

247
00:19:32,371 --> 00:19:35,101
This is the new editorfrom
the lmperial Academy

248
00:19:35,207 --> 00:19:37,266
Master Chang Fengwu

249
00:19:37,376 --> 00:19:38,638
Master Ji

250
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:42,810
Fengwu,good,it's a good name

251
00:19:43,615 --> 00:19:46,175
The day before I was born,my mother
had dreamt of

252
00:19:46,285 --> 00:19:49,049
A phoenix on a parasol tree

253
00:19:49,154 --> 00:19:51,088
So I was named
Feng£¨phoenix£©Wu£¨parasol tree£©

254
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:54,915
Fengwu,a phoenix on a parasol tree

255
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:58,155
So you were called Fengwu,
it's a good name

256
00:19:59,064 --> 00:20:02,966
Fengwu¡­oh dear

257
00:20:04,069 --> 00:20:05,297
That's too close

258
00:20:05,404 --> 00:20:06,428
To what£¿

259
00:20:06,972 --> 00:20:11,170
Your mother dreamt of a phoenix
on a parasol tree

260
00:20:11,276 --> 00:20:13,870
So you're called Fengwu,you're lucky

261
00:20:13,979 --> 00:20:18,143
Had she dreamt of a chicken
on a banana tree

262
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:20,650
¡­that's not very good

263
00:20:26,091 --> 00:20:27,058
What does that mean£¿

264
00:20:27,159 --> 00:20:30,185
A phoenix on a parasol tree

265
00:20:30,295 --> 00:20:31,922
That's why your name is Fengwu,right£¿

266
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:33,964
If a chicken lands on a banana tree

267
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:36,261
Then it must be Ji¡­

268
00:20:41,607 --> 00:20:43,939
Old master¡­

269
00:20:44,042 --> 00:20:45,202
Wait

270
00:20:47,512 --> 00:20:48,342
Don't leave now

271
00:20:48,647 --> 00:20:50,615
Old master¡­

272
00:20:50,716 --> 00:20:51,512
What's the matter¡­

273
00:20:51,617 --> 00:20:53,778
Please tell us a joke

274
00:20:53,885 --> 00:20:57,514
I'm busy now,maybe next time

275
00:20:57,623 --> 00:20:59,648
Don't just leave

276
00:21:02,227 --> 00:21:03,125
You have to tell us one¡­

277
00:21:03,228 --> 00:21:04,820
Just a short one

278
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:07,626
Okay¡­a short one

279
00:21:09,668 --> 00:21:10,930
Once upon a time

280
00:21:11,036 --> 00:21:11,866
What happened£¿

281
00:21:11,970 --> 00:21:13,870
There was a eunuch

282
00:21:13,972 --> 00:21:15,940
Once upon a time there was a eunuch,
what next£¿

283
00:21:16,041 --> 00:21:17,008
Next£¿

284
00:21:17,309 --> 00:21:18,867
Right,what next£¿

285
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:21,310
Nothing

286
00:21:23,782 --> 00:21:24,874
It's that short£¿

287
00:21:24,983 --> 00:21:27,918
Short£¿ There's nothing

288
00:21:28,854 --> 00:21:30,219
Nothing£¿

289
00:21:30,322 --> 00:21:31,152
Nothing

290
00:21:33,925 --> 00:21:35,290
It's that short

291
00:21:35,394 --> 00:21:38,386
Ah¡­this old bastard

292
00:21:38,497 --> 00:21:38,986
What£¿

293
00:21:39,097 --> 00:21:41,327
He's right,do you have anything
down there£¿

294
00:21:41,733 --> 00:21:42,597
I don't

295
00:21:42,701 --> 00:21:45,101
That old bastard,he's making fun of us

296
00:21:45,203 --> 00:21:47,194
Right,I'll make him pay for this some day

297
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:49,536
When I get the chance

298
00:21:49,641 --> 00:21:51,040
I'll make it very difficult for him

299
00:21:51,143 --> 00:21:52,132
Right¡­

300
00:24:45,083 --> 00:24:46,050
Your Majesty

301
00:24:47,986 --> 00:24:49,783
Your Majesty

302
00:24:50,422 --> 00:24:51,753
Arise

303
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:53,552
Thank you,Your Majesty

304
00:25:25,657 --> 00:25:29,753
Where's Master Ji,the Chief Editor£¿

305
00:25:32,230 --> 00:25:33,561
He¡­

306
00:25:40,939 --> 00:25:43,169
Must be somewhere to get some fresh air

307
00:25:44,042 --> 00:25:46,670
Right,it's too hot here

308
00:25:48,346 --> 00:25:50,906
You're busy,please sit down

309
00:25:51,650 --> 00:25:52,639
Let's go

310

00:26:44,102 --> 00:26:45,763
Oh my laotouzi

315
00:26:47,172 --> 00:26:48,571

00:27:00,352 --> 00:27:01,580
Your Majesty

319
00:27:02,187 --> 00:27:07,887
You're not properly dressed,
it's already an offence

320
00:27:10,528 --> 00:27:13,793
And you call me laotouzi

321
00:27:14,232 --> 00:27:17,633
Right,this is really impolite

322
00:27:17,736 --> 00:27:20,796
And you even dare to call His Majesty
laotouzi

323
00:27:21,573 --> 00:27:23,666
Yes,this is too much

324
00:27:24,643 --> 00:27:29,444
Tell me what laotouzi means

325
00:27:29,547 --> 00:27:32,015
Am I really old £¨lao£©£¿

326
00:27:32,917 --> 00:27:39,379
You have to give me a good explanation now

327
00:27:39,491 --> 00:27:46,192
Otherwise I'll have your head chopped off

328
00:27:47,365 --> 00:27:49,663
I'll explain¡­

329
00:27:49,768 --> 00:27:50,666
Hurry up

330
00:27:53,738 --> 00:27:56,434
Hmm¡­

331
00:27:57,275 --> 00:28:01,905
Lao means to live as long as Heaven

332
00:28:03,348 --> 00:28:08,615
To live as long as Heaven

333
00:28:10,188 --> 00:28:11,519
Then how about ¡°tou¡±£¿

334
00:28:12,490 --> 00:28:15,823
Men can't walk without a head

335
00:28:15,927 --> 00:28:18,020
Your Majesty is the head of all people

336
00:28:18,129 --> 00:28:19,596
So this is ¡°tou¡±

337
00:28:21,232 --> 00:28:22,699
How about ¡°zi¡±£¿

338
00:28:23,768 --> 00:28:27,898
It means Your Majesty is the son
of Heaven and Earth

339
00:28:28,473 --> 00:28:31,340
Son of Heaven and Earth

340
00:28:34,679 --> 00:28:36,874
Laotouzi

341
00:28:38,883 --> 00:28:42,250
Good,Laotouzi

342
00:28:43,088 --> 00:28:46,615
Lao means to live as long as Heaven

343
00:28:46,725 --> 00:28:49,023
Tou means you're head of all people

344
00:28:49,127 --> 00:28:51,322
Zi means your parents are Heaven and Earth

345
00:28:51,429 --> 00:28:54,523
So Your Majesty is loatouzi

346
00:28:55,467 --> 00:29:00,063
Loutouzi,my loatouzi

347
00:29:04,275 --> 00:29:05,105
Come here

348
00:29:05,210 --> 00:29:06,199
Yes

349
00:29:07,645 --> 00:29:10,239
It's hot but Master Ji is allowed

350
00:29:10,348 --> 00:29:13,317
To work here without a shirt

351
00:29:13,418 --> 00:29:15,318
It's not your business

352
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:16,114
Yes

353
00:29:17,055 --> 00:29:19,046
You four stay here to sever Master Ji
from now on

354
00:29:19,157 --> 00:29:20,715
To keep him cool and comfortable

355
00:29:20,825 --> 00:29:21,655
Yes

356
00:30:13,978 --> 00:30:16,105
Ji Xiaolan was not the only scholar

357
00:30:16,214 --> 00:30:18,205
who was renowned for his humour

358
00:30:18,316 --> 00:30:20,147
There was also Liu Yong,another scholar

359
00:30:20,251 --> 00:30:24,312
Who was humorous and eloquent

360
00:30:24,422 --> 00:30:26,754
Liu had been a high ranking
government official

361
00:30:26,858 --> 00:30:29,588
¡­and a scholar of the lmperial Academy

362
00:30:29,694 --> 00:30:32,925
Because of his humour and eloquence

363
00:30:33,031 --> 00:30:35,261
He won Chien Lung's favour

364
00:30:35,366 --> 00:30:38,358
They often made fun of each other

365
00:30:38,469 --> 00:30:41,632
And here's a story about them

366
00:30:44,142 --> 00:30:45,040
Rong An

367
00:30:45,143 --> 00:30:45,837
Yes,Your Majesty

368
00:30:45,944 --> 00:30:47,605
Does he look like a hunchback£¿

369
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:52,539
Yes,exactly

370
00:30:52,650 --> 00:30:55,346
It might take him all day

371
00:30:55,453 --> 00:30:57,387
to climb all the 864 steps

372
00:30:59,390 --> 00:31:02,120
See,he's breathing heavily

373
00:31:02,227 --> 00:31:04,195
And really looks like a hunchback

374
00:31:04,295 --> 00:31:05,284
Yes¡­

375
00:31:16,541 --> 00:31:17,007
Come here

376
00:31:17,108 --> 00:31:18,166
Yes

377
00:31:18,276 --> 00:31:19,265
Tell him to hurry up

378
00:31:19,377 --> 00:31:20,105
Yes

379
00:31:25,583 --> 00:31:27,642
Master Liu,His Majesty wants to
talk to you

380
00:31:27,752 --> 00:31:28,650
Please hurry up

381
00:31:28,753 --> 00:31:29,515
Okay

382
00:31:40,331 --> 00:31:42,492
Hurry up,Master Liu

383
00:32:11,963 --> 00:32:19,301
Your¡­

384
00:32:20,538 --> 00:32:23,507
Oh,my dear Master Liu

385
00:32:23,608 --> 00:32:28,011
It's not easy for you to climb
all these steps

386
00:32:31,049 --> 00:32:38,785
Your Majesty,Liu Yong kowtow¡­

387
00:32:38,890 --> 00:32:45,352
Long live¡­long live

388
00:32:46,230 --> 00:32:47,219
Arise

389
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:50,065
Thank you,Your Majesty

390
00:32:57,342 --> 00:32:59,435
Liu Yong

391
00:32:59,544 --> 00:33:00,533
Yes,Your Majesty

392
00:33:02,547 --> 00:33:05,380
Why are you so slow today£¿

393
00:33:05,483 --> 00:33:07,212
You're becoming a hunchback

394
00:33:08,653 --> 00:33:11,383
Thank you,Your Majesty

395
00:33:15,593 --> 00:33:17,288
What for£¿

396
00:33:18,062 --> 00:33:21,589
Thank you for giving me the title
¡°Hunchback¡±

397
00:33:24,635 --> 00:33:28,196
What's that title good for£¿

398
00:33:29,907 --> 00:33:30,532
From now on,I can have an extra salary of

399
00:33:30,641 --> 00:33:33,735
20 thousand a year

400
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:37,070
Why is that so£¿

401
00:33:37,949 --> 00:33:39,610
It was established by the ancestors
of Qing

402
00:33:40,952 --> 00:33:42,476
Established by our ancestors£¿

403
00:33:42,587 --> 00:33:45,920
Yes,it came from the ancestors

404
00:33:46,024 --> 00:33:48,390
At the time of Emperor Shun Zhi,
his titles included£º

405
00:33:48,493 --> 00:33:52,486
Titian,Longyun,Dingtong,Jianji

406
00:33:52,597 --> 00:33:56,192
Yinrui,Qinwen,Xianwu,Dade

407
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:59,360
Honggong,Zhiren,Chunxiao

408
00:33:59,470 --> 00:34:00,664
You're an erudite

409
00:34:00,772 --> 00:34:02,171
For each extra title

410
00:34:02,273 --> 00:34:06,073
An extra sum of 20 thousand was added

411
00:34:06,177 --> 00:34:08,042
I have blessings from my ancestors

412
00:34:08,146 --> 00:34:11,741
And thus get the title ¡°Hunchback¡±
from Your Majesty

413
00:34:11,849 --> 00:34:15,785
I should say thank you to Your Majesty

414
00:34:17,422 --> 00:34:20,687
I am not giving you the title ¡°Hunchback¡±

415
00:34:20,792 --> 00:34:23,989
It's nothing serious,it's just a joke

416
00:34:25,830 --> 00:34:28,094
A monarch always speaks seriously

417
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:32,135
You can't deny what you've said

418
00:34:32,236 --> 00:34:36,138
If you don't take this seriously

419
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:40,973
How can we believe in you£¿

420
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:44,480
You're the Emperor,you have to
keep your word

421
00:34:44,582 --> 00:34:48,382
Okay,I grant you the extra
20 thousand every year

422
00:34:49,187 --> 00:34:50,552
Thank you,Your Majesty

423
00:34:50,655 --> 00:34:52,213
Your Majesty¡­

424
00:34:52,323 --> 00:34:54,655
Think of something to trick him

425
00:34:54,759 --> 00:34:56,989
So I can revoke his title

426
00:34:57,095 --> 00:34:58,027
Yes¡­

427
00:34:59,630 --> 00:35:02,360
Okay,arise

428
00:35:02,467 --> 00:35:04,059
Thank you,Your Majesty

429
00:35:06,838 --> 00:35:13,402
The Emperor is leaving now

430
00:35:14,178 --> 00:35:17,204
Enjoy your extra salary

431
00:35:17,315 --> 00:35:18,009
Yes

432
00:35:18,883 --> 00:35:20,908
Oh,that's right

433
00:35:21,018 --> 00:35:25,148
This extra money is really enough for you

434
00:35:25,256 --> 00:35:29,352
Master Liu,let's wait and see

435
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:36,696
Rong An

436
00:35:36,801 --> 00:35:37,597
Yes,Your Majesty

437
00:35:46,944 --> 00:35:50,471
Master Liu,when His Majesty was
climbing the steps

438
00:35:50,581 --> 00:35:52,981
I had wished him good luck

439
00:35:53,084 --> 00:35:55,746
Wish him to ascend higher with every step

440
00:35:55,853 --> 00:35:56,285
Yes

441
00:35:56,387 --> 00:35:59,049
Now His Majesty is coming down the steps

442
00:35:59,157 --> 00:36:02,558
You go and wish His Majesty good luck

443
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:06,061
And make His Majesty feeling happy

444
00:36:09,267 --> 00:36:12,134
Doesn't matter,take your time

445
00:36:12,236 --> 00:36:15,637
It's not too late if he can do it¡­

446
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:18,368
before I set foot on flat ground

447
00:36:18,476 --> 00:36:22,572
Otherwise I'll take back his title

448
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:25,672
With 20 thousand dollars a year

449
00:36:25,783 --> 00:36:28,445
After 10 years it'll add up
to 200 thousand

450
00:36:28,553 --> 00:36:31,386
If you are going to live to 80 or even 1 00

451
00:36:31,489 --> 00:36:33,787
Then I end up paying pay you a fortune

452
00:36:33,891 --> 00:36:36,985
Yes,that's a huge amount of money

453
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:43,724
So£¿

454
00:36:44,569 --> 00:36:46,298
You see¡­

455
00:36:46,404 --> 00:36:47,530
Down with every step

456
00:36:48,005 --> 00:36:49,768
Missing every step

457
00:36:49,874 --> 00:36:51,535
Slipping with every step

458
00:36:51,642 --> 00:36:52,574
Sliding with every step

459
00:36:52,677 --> 00:36:53,575
Lowering with every step

460
00:36:53,678 --> 00:36:55,543
A step is worse than the next

461
00:36:59,083 --> 00:37:01,813
Your Majesty

462
00:37:04,789 --> 00:37:08,088
I have made a wish for you¡­

463
00:37:10,094 --> 00:37:13,120
Your Majesty,I wish you

464
00:37:13,231 --> 00:37:15,529
to have smarter descendents

465
00:37:15,633 --> 00:37:21,401
Each generation is smarter than
their elders

466
00:37:24,242 --> 00:37:27,211
Good¡­

467
00:37:28,813 --> 00:37:30,781
Thank you,Your Majesty

468
00:37:31,515 --> 00:37:33,676
Oh shit,let's go

469
00:37:37,321 --> 00:37:39,789
Master Liu,you're really smart

470
00:37:40,524 --> 00:37:44,927
And you can keep your extra salary

471
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:57,635
Your Majesty,is that title¡­

472
00:37:57,742 --> 00:37:59,334
really worth 20 thousand dollars£¿

473
00:38:01,045 --> 00:38:03,673
He has a reason for this,I can't help

474
00:38:04,115 --> 00:38:05,275
His head is full of vicious ideas

475
00:38:07,652 --> 00:38:08,949
You have to think of something

476
00:38:09,053 --> 00:38:11,613
He can't have that extra money for free

477
00:38:11,722 --> 00:38:13,417
I'm thinking as we speak

478
00:38:18,529 --> 00:38:20,520
Your Majesty,I have an idea

479
00:38:22,433 --> 00:38:23,764
What idea£¿

480
00:38:24,602 --> 00:38:25,864
This¡­

481
00:38:26,737 --> 00:38:27,669
Tell me

482
00:38:27,772 --> 00:38:30,468
You haven't rewarded him for
his good wish yet

483
00:38:30,975 --> 00:38:34,433
A reward£¿ That old bastard

484
00:38:34,545 --> 00:38:37,673
No,just set up a trap to trick him

485
00:38:37,782 --> 00:38:38,976
How£¿

486
00:38:39,083 --> 00:38:41,677
Give him that ring you're wearing

487
00:38:41,786 --> 00:38:44,220
If Liu took it and put it on

488
00:38:44,322 --> 00:38:47,257
then he would have offended the Emperor

489
00:38:47,358 --> 00:38:48,791
But you should spare his death punishment

490
00:38:48,893 --> 00:38:52,021
And only revoke his title

491
00:38:54,065 --> 00:38:55,157
What if he didn't put the ring on£¿

492
00:38:55,266 --> 00:38:58,793
Then he is disobeying the Emperor's order

493
00:38:58,903 --> 00:39:01,531
His title should be revoked

494
00:39:01,872 --> 00:39:02,634
Good idea

495
00:39:06,777 --> 00:39:07,675
Liu Yong

496
00:39:12,216 --> 00:39:14,013
Wait for the imperial order

497
00:39:14,118 --> 00:39:16,916
You've just said something very nice

498
00:39:18,656 --> 00:39:20,214
I give you this ring as a reward

499
00:39:20,324 --> 00:39:21,018
Thank you,Your Majesty

500
00:39:23,861 --> 00:39:25,658
Master Liu,you may put it on

501
00:39:31,435 --> 00:39:32,959
Thank you,Your Majesty

502
00:39:35,873 --> 00:39:36,567
Liu Yong

503
00:39:36,674 --> 00:39:37,470
Yes,Your Majesty

504
00:39:37,575 --> 00:39:39,338
Why don't you put it on£¿

505
00:39:39,443 --> 00:39:41,411
I dare not to

506
00:39:41,512 --> 00:39:47,644
Why£¿ You must think it's cheap,right£¿

507
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:50,414
This is a reward from Your Majesty

508
00:39:50,521 --> 00:39:52,512
I dare not to think it's cheap

509
00:39:52,623 --> 00:39:55,649
Then why don't you just put it on£¿

510
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:58,251
If I do,I'm offending the Emperor

511
00:39:58,362 --> 00:40:01,229
If I don't,I'm disobeying the Emperor

512
00:40:05,703 --> 00:40:08,069
But you can't keep holding it
just like that

513
00:40:08,706 --> 00:40:10,173
I'll give it to my servants and
ask them¡­

514
00:40:10,274 --> 00:40:13,607
to take it back to my home in Shandong

515
00:40:13,711 --> 00:40:16,145
And place it in our ancestral shrine

516
00:40:16,247 --> 00:40:19,978
But now I'll put it over my hat

517
00:40:26,724 --> 00:40:28,055
He wins that ring

518
00:40:38,436 --> 00:40:40,165
You must think of something to trick him

519
00:40:40,271 --> 00:40:41,033
Yes

520
00:41:22,546 --> 00:41:25,674
Forty skating beauties from Korea are here

521
00:41:25,783 --> 00:41:28,752
They're ready to perform for Your Majesty

522
00:41:30,521 --> 00:41:32,887
Okay,start the performance

523
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:35,390
¡°Celebration Hall¡±

524
00:43:17,227 --> 00:43:20,560
Your Majesty,I have an idea

525
00:43:20,664 --> 00:43:21,596
What idea£¿

526
00:43:21,699 --> 00:43:24,429
There's an ice hole under that bridge

527
00:43:24,535 --> 00:43:27,265
When the performance is over

528
00:43:27,371 --> 00:43:30,238
You ask Liu to jump into that ice hole

529
00:43:31,542 --> 00:43:32,907
Jump into that ice hole£¿

530
00:43:33,377 --> 00:43:35,538
You may ask him

531
00:43:35,646 --> 00:43:38,171
If a father asks his son to die
but the son refuses

532
00:43:38,282 --> 00:43:39,681
What is this£¿

533
00:43:39,783 --> 00:43:40,613
This is impious

534
00:43:40,718 --> 00:43:45,451
If a monarch asks his subject to die
but he refuses

535
00:43:45,556 --> 00:43:47,046
What is this£¿

536
00:43:47,157 --> 00:43:48,089
This is disloyalty

537
00:43:48,192 --> 00:43:51,889
Exactly. Your Majesty,if he refused

538
00:43:51,996 --> 00:43:54,430
Then he's disobeying you

539
00:43:54,531 --> 00:43:57,056
You can revoke his title

540
00:43:58,836 --> 00:44:00,269
What if he did jump£¿

541
00:44:00,371 --> 00:44:02,339
Then you call for rescue

542
00:44:02,439 --> 00:44:05,306
He's still disloyal because he hasn't died

543
00:44:05,409 --> 00:44:08,503
You can revoke his title

544
00:44:08,612 --> 00:44:12,844
And take back that ring

545
00:45:14,878 --> 00:45:15,708
Rong An

546
00:45:15,813 --> 00:45:17,075
Yes,Your Majesty

547
00:45:17,781 --> 00:45:18,577
Yes

548
00:45:19,750 --> 00:45:21,217
Pass the Emperor's order

549
00:45:21,318 --> 00:45:22,649
Reward each performer with

550
00:45:22,753 --> 00:45:26,018
4 large rolls of silk

551
00:45:26,123 --> 00:45:28,387
4 small rolls of silk

552
00:45:28,492 --> 00:45:32,053
Five pairs of silk pouches

553
00:45:32,162 --> 00:45:33,561
Reward each ambassador with

554
00:45:33,664 --> 00:45:36,997
3 rolls of fine silk and 3 rolls of wool

555
00:45:37,101 --> 00:45:39,501
And have a banquet in Ziguang Hall

556
00:45:39,603 --> 00:45:41,833
Thank you,Your Majesty

557
00:46:02,126 --> 00:46:03,320
Liu Yong

558
00:46:07,364 --> 00:46:08,353
Yes,Your Majesty

559
00:46:10,134 --> 00:46:11,624
There's an old saying

560
00:46:11,735 --> 00:46:14,636
I remember only the first part
but not the second part

561
00:46:14,738 --> 00:46:17,730
Please tell me what I've forgotten

562
00:46:17,841 --> 00:46:19,331
I don't deserve to do this

563
00:46:20,744 --> 00:46:24,475
A father asks his son to die
but the son refuses

564
00:46:24,581 --> 00:46:26,014
What is this£¿

565
00:46:26,517 --> 00:46:28,485
This is impious

566
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:32,611
A monarch asks his subject to die
but he refuses£¿

567
00:46:35,859 --> 00:46:38,157
This is disloyal

568
00:46:40,030 --> 00:46:42,965
So

569
00:46:43,066 --> 00:46:47,093
I'm the monarch and you're the subject

570
00:46:47,204 --> 00:46:52,164
Now I am asking you to die

571
00:46:54,378 --> 00:46:55,777
And you go to die now

572
00:46:56,446 --> 00:46:57,572
This¡­

573
00:46:57,681 --> 00:47:00,149
Master Liu,accept the imperial order

574
00:47:00,250 --> 00:47:01,478
Now I¡­

575
00:47:06,490 --> 00:47:07,980
I'm waiting for the imperial order

576
00:47:09,359 --> 00:47:11,224
What order£¿

577
00:47:11,328 --> 00:47:14,092
I told you to die and you just go and die

578
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,594
Your Majesty only told me to die

579
00:47:19,703 --> 00:47:23,662
But haven't told me how to die

580
00:47:29,413 --> 00:47:31,313
There's an ice hole over there

581
00:47:31,415 --> 00:47:32,939
You can just jump into that hole

582
00:47:39,523 --> 00:47:41,218
I accept the order

583
00:49:18,288 --> 00:49:19,312
Is he really jumping£¿

584
00:50:29,559 --> 00:50:30,719
What happened£¿

585
00:50:31,795 --> 00:50:33,023
Yes¡­

586
00:50:33,430 --> 00:50:35,728
Right,I'll go and ask

587
00:50:35,832 --> 00:50:39,734
Thank you for reminding me,see you later

588
00:51:13,270 --> 00:51:15,602
Liu Yong has completed your order

589
00:51:18,942 --> 00:51:22,434
Completed£¿ What£¿

590
00:51:22,546 --> 00:51:25,140
If you're dead then you've completed
my order

591
00:51:25,982 --> 00:51:29,850
You haven't jumped into the ice hole yet

592
00:51:29,953 --> 00:51:31,716
And you think you've completed my order£¿

593
00:51:33,723 --> 00:51:36,624
Your Majesty,before I jump

594
00:51:36,726 --> 00:51:39,957
a man in the water stops me

595
00:51:40,063 --> 00:51:41,553
Oh£¿

596
00:51:43,333 --> 00:51:45,062
And he speaks to me

597
00:51:45,168 --> 00:51:48,569
He tells me to come back
and ask Your Majesty

598
00:51:48,672 --> 00:51:51,903
¡­before I jump into that ice hole

599
00:51:52,375 --> 00:51:58,905
There's even a man in the water,who's he£¿

600
00:51:59,416 --> 00:52:03,113
He's Qu Yuan of the Chu State

601
00:52:05,021 --> 00:52:06,750
Is he the one who was forced to jump into

602
00:52:06,857 --> 00:52:10,554
Miluo River by a tyrant
and killed himself£¿

603
00:52:10,660 --> 00:52:15,859
Yes,that's Qu Yuan who was forced to jump

604
00:52:15,966 --> 00:52:18,093
into the Miluo River because
a tyrant listened

605
00:52:18,201 --> 00:52:21,398
to slanderous talks

606
00:52:23,173 --> 00:52:25,198
What does he tell you£¿

607
00:52:26,009 --> 00:52:30,241
He tells me thus£º

608
00:52:30,347 --> 00:52:33,043
I had met a tyrant so I had to die

609
00:52:33,150 --> 00:52:35,618
You've met a smart emperor
so you should live

610
00:52:35,986 --> 00:52:37,613
Go back and ask the Emperor

611
00:52:37,721 --> 00:52:40,383
¡­before you come back and die

612
00:52:42,826 --> 00:52:44,726
And I think

613
00:52:44,828 --> 00:52:48,662
I'm nothing,but Your Majesty's name
is important

614
00:52:48,765 --> 00:52:52,201
Though Qu Yuan was killed by a tyrant

615
00:52:52,302 --> 00:52:55,965
Yet people keep remembering him

616
00:52:56,072 --> 00:52:58,870
Every year during Dragon Boat Festival

617
00:52:58,975 --> 00:53:03,275
We still have dragon boat races
and rice dumplings

618
00:53:03,380 --> 00:53:06,213
We remember Qu Yuan when we have
rice dumplings

619
00:53:06,316 --> 00:53:07,578
When we remember Qu Yuan

620
00:53:07,684 --> 00:53:10,676
We also remember that tyrant

621
00:53:10,787 --> 00:53:13,984
So he asks me to come back and make sure

622
00:53:14,090 --> 00:53:17,548
You're an intelligent and virtuous monarch

623
00:53:17,661 --> 00:53:23,122
How can you force an official to die
just because of

624
00:53:23,233 --> 00:53:26,396
paying an extra salary
of 20 thousand dollars£¿

625
00:53:33,076 --> 00:53:36,512
My life is nothing but a feather

626
00:53:36,613 --> 00:53:41,380
Your Majesty's name will last
for generations

627
00:53:41,484 --> 00:53:44,044
So I want to make sure

628
00:53:44,154 --> 00:53:48,648
My intelligent and virtuous monarch

629
00:53:48,758 --> 00:53:54,424
Do you want me to die or not£¿

630
00:53:55,632 --> 00:53:58,123
Well¡­

631
00:53:59,569 --> 00:54:01,332
You don't have to die

632
00:54:02,005 --> 00:54:03,131
If I told you to die

633
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:07,108
Then I would become that tyrant

634
00:54:14,818 --> 00:54:16,752
Okay,you don't have to die

635
00:54:16,853 --> 00:54:20,311
You stay alive and keep annoying me

636
00:54:21,191 --> 00:54:22,590
Yes,Your Majesty

637
00:54:26,263 --> 00:54:29,721
The 1st month of the 16th year
of Chien Lung's reign

638
00:54:29,833 --> 00:54:33,200
Chien Lung went to the south
with Queen Mother

639
00:54:33,303 --> 00:54:37,034
He had taken six trips to the south

640
00:54:37,140 --> 00:54:40,234
Some say he went to visit his real parents

641
00:54:40,343 --> 00:54:42,174
But this is totally groundless

642
00:54:43,113 --> 00:54:44,307
The emperors of Qing dynasty

643
00:54:44,414 --> 00:54:46,814
Went to the Summer Resort in Rehe
every year

644
00:54:46,916 --> 00:54:47,974
Not only to hide away from the heat
in Beijing

645
00:54:48,084 --> 00:54:51,247
But also keep a leeway for themselves

646
00:54:51,354 --> 00:54:54,414
And to make connections with
the Mongolian tribes

647
00:54:54,991 --> 00:54:56,788
Trips to the south is also
public relations work

648
00:54:56,893 --> 00:55:00,158
To maintain good relations with Han people

649
00:55:00,263 --> 00:55:04,063
Minor taxes would be waived

650
00:55:04,167 --> 00:55:07,762
And visited those retired ministers
and officials

651
00:55:07,871 --> 00:55:11,500
Elders were invited to banquets as well

652
00:55:11,608 --> 00:55:14,042
And of course the Emperor might just

653
00:55:14,144 --> 00:55:16,442
Go to the south for his own pleasure

654
00:55:16,546 --> 00:55:19,071
Ministers and officials around him

655
00:55:19,182 --> 00:55:20,615
Would never offend him

656
00:55:20,717 --> 00:55:22,480
By telling the truth

657
00:55:22,585 --> 00:55:23,609
If he wanted to know the truth

658
00:55:23,720 --> 00:55:26,018
He had to go to the people

659
00:55:26,122 --> 00:55:28,056
So he left the lmperial Palace alone

660
00:55:28,158 --> 00:55:29,147
And posed as a merchant

661
00:55:29,626 --> 00:55:30,456
If someone asked questions

662
00:55:30,560 --> 00:55:33,893
He would say he's Gao Tianci from Beijing

663
00:55:34,497 --> 00:55:37,660
Honestly,this was a pompous name

664
00:55:38,535 --> 00:55:40,594
Boss,is your business good£¿

665
00:55:40,704 --> 00:55:44,663
Just so so¡­

666
00:55:46,376 --> 00:55:47,934
Excuse me

667
00:55:48,044 --> 00:55:51,172
Sir,how may I be of any help£¿

668
00:55:51,915 --> 00:55:55,043
People in Yangzhou are serious
about their tea

669
00:55:55,151 --> 00:55:57,415
Which is the best teahouse here£¿

670
00:55:57,954 --> 00:56:03,392
Do you want just tea or tea with food£¿

671
00:56:05,462 --> 00:56:08,989
Well,what's the difference£¿

672
00:56:09,599 --> 00:56:13,865
You northerners only have tea

673
00:56:13,970 --> 00:56:17,872
with melon seeds or peanuts

674
00:56:17,974 --> 00:56:22,001
We here are serious about having tea
with food

675
00:56:22,112 --> 00:56:24,103
Here's the best teahouse

676
00:56:24,214 --> 00:56:27,650
The Merry Teahouse over there

677
00:56:28,385 --> 00:56:29,443
Merry Teahouse

678
00:56:30,320 --> 00:56:35,314
Go straight ahead,then turn right
and there's an arch

679
00:56:35,425 --> 00:56:38,121
That's the Merry Teahouse

680
00:56:38,228 --> 00:56:39,195
Thank you

681
00:57:09,359 --> 00:57:10,826
¡°Merry Teahouse¡±

682
00:57:23,006 --> 00:57:24,940
Where are you going£¿ Come with me now

683
00:57:54,404 --> 00:57:56,770
Sir,please go upstairs

684
00:58:29,005 --> 00:58:31,667
Old gentleman,this is hot water

685
00:58:31,774 --> 00:58:34,265
It's bad to scald you,it's also bad
to scald me

686
00:58:34,377 --> 00:58:36,174
It's bad if someone is scalded

687
00:58:36,279 --> 00:58:40,716
You're not the emperor,
stop dashing around

688
00:58:57,333 --> 00:58:58,265
Lao San

689
00:59:18,821 --> 00:59:19,810
Waiter

690
00:59:22,058 --> 00:59:22,888
Ignore him

691
00:59:27,664 --> 00:59:28,756
Waiter

692
00:59:30,066 --> 00:59:31,226
Waiter

693
00:59:31,601 --> 00:59:32,795
Looks like he's a newcomer

694
00:59:32,902 --> 00:59:35,666
Bring me tea,bring me tea

695
00:59:35,772 --> 00:59:36,739
Want to have tea£¿

696
00:59:38,174 --> 00:59:39,141
I'm here for the tea

697
00:59:39,242 --> 00:59:42,268
You haven't been here before,have you£¿

698
00:59:42,378 --> 00:59:43,436
This is the first time

699
00:59:44,013 --> 00:59:47,210
That's why you don't know our custom here

700
00:59:48,751 --> 00:59:50,309
What custom£¿

701
00:59:50,954 --> 00:59:53,320
Have you brought the tea leaves£¿

702
00:59:54,157 --> 00:59:56,022
I come here for tea

703
00:59:56,125 --> 00:59:58,218
I know you're coming for tea

704
00:59:58,328 --> 01:00:01,957
But you haven't brought your own
tea leaves

705
01:00:02,365 --> 01:00:03,992
I come here for tea

706
01:00:04,100 --> 01:00:06,091
We don't have tea leaves here

707
01:00:06,202 --> 01:00:09,194
No£¿ How can you have tea without
tea leaves£¿

708
01:00:09,672 --> 01:00:11,640
You have to buy your own tea leaves

709
01:00:11,741 --> 01:00:14,039
We only offer water but not tea leaves

710
01:00:15,244 --> 01:00:18,509
Then don't call it a teahouse,
this is a waterhouse

711
01:00:18,615 --> 01:00:21,675
This is our custom here

712
01:00:21,784 --> 01:00:23,081
Where should I go to buy the tea leaves£¿

713
01:00:24,053 --> 01:00:26,487
See,that shop opposite the street

714
01:00:26,589 --> 01:00:29,615
Tea leaves are packed into small packages

715
01:00:34,364 --> 01:00:36,924
Old gentleman,this is the best
Longjin tea

716
01:00:38,101 --> 01:00:39,295
Old gentleman£¿

717
01:00:40,737 --> 01:00:41,635
Waiter

718
01:00:42,905 --> 01:00:44,031
Coming¡­

719
01:00:47,810 --> 01:00:49,471
Yes,old gentleman

720
01:00:49,946 --> 01:00:51,743
Is this for one pot or two pots

721
01:00:52,181 --> 01:00:53,148
For one pot

722
01:01:01,324 --> 01:01:04,191
Old gentleman,is this your first time
in Yangzhou£¿

723
01:01:07,530 --> 01:01:09,191
Do you think I'm old£¿

724
01:01:09,298 --> 01:01:11,892
Calling me ¡°old gentleman¡± all the time

725
01:01:14,637 --> 01:01:17,071
Sir,there's a saying which goes £º

726
01:01:17,173 --> 01:01:20,665
Boats all become small when they come
to Guazhou

727
01:01:20,777 --> 01:01:22,836
Because the harbour of Guazhou is very big

728
01:01:22,945 --> 01:01:25,311
All boats seem small in comparison

729
01:01:25,415 --> 01:01:27,110
We Yangzhou folk are very polite

730
01:01:27,216 --> 01:01:29,650
We call those in their thirties
¡°old gentleman¡±

731
01:01:31,721 --> 01:01:33,814
This is because you are polite

732
01:01:34,157 --> 01:01:36,455
If you're going further south

733
01:01:36,559 --> 01:01:38,550
People in Guangzhou are even more polite

734
01:01:38,661 --> 01:01:39,923
They call everyone lao £¨old£©

735
01:01:40,730 --> 01:01:41,992
Tall ones are gaolao

736
01:01:42,098 --> 01:01:44,191
Fat ones are feilao

737
01:01:44,300 --> 01:01:45,790
Bald ones are guangtaolao

738
01:01:45,902 --> 01:01:48,370
Those with beard are husulao

Weaklings are Kuilao

742
01:01:53,843 --> 01:01:55,811
Strong ones are daizilao

743
01:01:56,546 --> 01:01:58,070
Drunkards are zuijiulao

744
01:01:58,181 --> 01:02:00,376
Womanizers are hanshilao

745
01:02:00,483 --> 01:02:02,110
Thieves are zeilao

746
01:02:02,218 --> 01:02:04,277
Policemen are chailao

747
01:02:04,387 --> 01:02:05,319
Older brother is dalao

748
01:02:05,421 --> 01:02:06,752
Younger brother is xilao

749
01:02:07,390 --> 01:02:10,188
The ignorant is menglao

750
01:02:10,293 --> 01:02:13,285
Gossipy like me is yashualao

751
01:02:13,396 --> 01:02:15,694
Singles are gualao

752
01:02:15,798 --> 01:02:18,062
I have a wife¡­

753
01:02:18,935 --> 01:02:21,096
She calls me shuailao all the time

754
01:02:21,204 --> 01:02:23,172
Why does she call you shuailao£¿

755
01:02:23,272 --> 01:02:25,706
Because I'm a kuilao

756
01:02:35,618 --> 01:02:37,552
What kind of lao is this fellow£¿

757
01:02:38,521 --> 01:02:42,218
He's not a lao,he's the older brother
of lao

758
01:02:42,325 --> 01:02:43,690
He's xilaoge

759
01:02:45,828 --> 01:02:49,355
How about in Yangzhou dialect£¿

760
01:02:50,032 --> 01:02:54,196
We call him xiaolaodi

761
01:02:54,670 --> 01:02:56,365
Xiaolaodi

762
01:02:59,942 --> 01:03:00,704
Come here¡­

763
01:03:11,454 --> 01:03:12,352
What is this for£¿

764
01:03:14,924 --> 01:03:15,913
For having tea

765
01:03:16,659 --> 01:03:17,956
What are the chopsticks for£¿

766
01:03:21,330 --> 01:03:25,266
People here are serious in tea drinking

767
01:03:25,368 --> 01:03:26,801
So you eat the tea leaves as well£¿

768
01:03:26,903 --> 01:03:29,030
No¡­this is for the meat jelly

769
01:03:29,639 --> 01:03:30,264
Meat jelly£¿

770
01:03:30,373 --> 01:03:33,809
Right¡­meat jelly is famous in Yangzhou

771
01:03:33,910 --> 01:03:34,808
Try some¡­

772
01:03:40,750 --> 01:03:42,149
At least have one piece

773
01:03:43,853 --> 01:03:47,289
Is it okay to have meat with tea£¿

774
01:03:47,390 --> 01:03:49,824
It's okay. Don't worry,old gentleman

775
01:03:49,926 --> 01:03:52,793
Meat is not the only food we have here

776
01:03:52,895 --> 01:03:57,798
We have ribs,chicken and
crab dumplings too

777
01:03:57,900 --> 01:04:00,460
You can also have wine here

778
01:04:00,570 --> 01:04:03,437
If you don't drink wine you can have tea

779
01:04:05,975 --> 01:04:07,806
No wonder they call this tea with food

780
01:04:08,544 --> 01:04:11,274
A while back didn't you say
you have crab dumplings£¿

781
01:04:11,380 --> 01:04:12,438
Yes,dumplings with soup

782
01:04:12,915 --> 01:04:14,348
So you put dumplings in the soup£¿

783
01:04:14,450 --> 01:04:18,113
No¡­it's soup within the dumplings

784
01:04:18,521 --> 01:04:20,113
You can't have this in the north

785
01:04:20,223 --> 01:04:22,248
The emperor's cooks might be able to

786
01:04:22,358 --> 01:04:25,191
Prepare a grand imperial banquet

787
01:04:25,294 --> 01:04:28,354
They can't make dumplings with soup inside

788
01:04:28,464 --> 01:04:31,331
Even the emperor would have
never tasted this

789
01:04:31,434 --> 01:04:32,958
Don't you believe this£¿

790
01:04:34,337 --> 01:04:35,167
I believe

791
01:04:37,807 --> 01:04:40,605
People said the emperor has been
in Yangzhou

792
01:04:40,710 --> 01:04:43,804
He should try this delicacy

793
01:04:45,848 --> 01:04:48,908
Right¡­I want to try this delicacy too

794
01:04:49,018 --> 01:04:51,418
Bring me some crab dumplings

795
01:04:51,520 --> 01:04:52,111
Okay

796
01:04:53,723 --> 01:04:55,418
Old gentleman,your crab dumplings

797
01:04:55,524 --> 01:04:57,014
Would you like to add one
or two extra ingredients£¿

798
01:04:57,960 --> 01:05:00,986
What does that mean£¿

799
01:05:01,097 --> 01:05:02,621
You can add more pork

800
01:05:02,732 --> 01:05:05,633
And more crab meat,just cost you
a little bit more

801
01:05:05,735 --> 01:05:09,330
Okay,add whatever you like,
just make them tasty

802
01:05:09,438 --> 01:05:10,700
Money is not a problem

803
01:05:10,806 --> 01:05:11,465
Sure

804
01:05:15,411 --> 01:05:21,441
One order of crab dumplings,
add 3 extra ingredients

805
01:05:22,718 --> 01:05:24,686
One order of crab dumplings,add 3 extras

806
01:05:26,122 --> 01:05:27,020
Please go upstairs

807
01:05:33,362 --> 01:05:34,727
This meat jelly is good

808
01:06:16,505 --> 01:06:17,437
Very tasty

809
01:06:24,280 --> 01:06:25,144
Here's your dumplings

810
01:06:49,372 --> 01:06:52,136
Bastard,waiter

811
01:06:53,442 --> 01:06:54,374
Coming¡­

812
01:06:56,912 --> 01:06:58,539
Old gentleman,can I help£¿

813
01:06:59,048 --> 01:07:00,913
Bastard,there's so much soup inside

814
01:07:02,385 --> 01:07:04,876
How can crab dumplings be
without soup inside£¿

815
01:07:05,521 --> 01:07:07,045
And why didn't you warn me
about that hot soup£¿

816
01:07:10,893 --> 01:07:12,326
It doesn't look hot from the outside

817
01:07:13,929 --> 01:07:15,556
That's why they're good dumplings

818
01:07:15,664 --> 01:07:18,428
You don't know there's hot soup inside

819
01:07:18,534 --> 01:07:22,300
People often remark that
the imperial banquet

820
01:07:22,405 --> 01:07:27,240
Has all sorts of delicacies

821
01:07:27,343 --> 01:07:31,609
Except the crab dumplings of Yangzhou

822
01:07:35,684 --> 01:07:36,810
Bastard

823
01:08:25,267 --> 01:08:26,165
Waiter

824
01:08:27,369 --> 01:08:28,165
Coming

825
01:08:30,840 --> 01:08:32,307
Old gentleman,what else would you like£¿

826
01:08:33,609 --> 01:08:37,045
No wonder there are many scholars
from the south

827
01:08:37,146 --> 01:08:39,444
Even a vegetable hawker can read

828
01:08:43,352 --> 01:08:48,415
He must be poor and can't afford to study

829
01:08:48,524 --> 01:08:51,322
He has to work and to study

830
01:08:51,427 --> 01:08:56,023
So now he's reading because
the business is slow

831
01:08:57,199 --> 01:08:58,223
Poor fellow

832
01:08:58,667 --> 01:09:00,225
Poor£¿

833
01:09:00,336 --> 01:09:05,171
Old gentleman,poor people are annoying

834
01:09:05,274 --> 01:09:07,538
You tell people what you're selling

835
01:09:07,643 --> 01:09:09,611
You do what you have to do

836
01:09:09,712 --> 01:09:11,373
But people like him

837
01:09:11,480 --> 01:09:14,040
Just sit there reading
but not selling his veggies

838
01:09:14,416 --> 01:09:16,213
Who knows what he's reading£¿

839
01:09:16,318 --> 01:09:18,946
Must be some sort of erotic writings

840
01:09:19,054 --> 01:09:23,957
Or just rubbish

841
01:09:31,200 --> 01:09:35,000
He's reading the Chunqiu,
he can be a scholar

842
01:09:38,240 --> 01:09:39,070
Waiter

843
01:09:39,175 --> 01:09:40,142
Coming¡­

844
01:09:40,976 --> 01:09:42,443
How may I help£¿

845
01:09:42,845 --> 01:09:44,608
Go and get that young man here

846
01:09:44,713 --> 01:09:46,237
There's something I wish to ask him

847
01:09:46,348 --> 01:09:47,975
What do you want to ask him£¿

848
01:09:49,318 --> 01:09:52,151
I've heard that the emperor is
coming to the south

849
01:09:52,254 --> 01:09:54,051
in search of those well-learned scholars

850
01:09:54,156 --> 01:09:56,716
My relative is a court official

851
01:09:56,825 --> 01:09:59,487
He comes to the south with the emperor

852
01:09:59,595 --> 01:10:04,464
If that young guy is really a scholar

853
01:10:04,567 --> 01:10:06,592
I'll take him to my relative

854
01:10:06,702 --> 01:10:08,795
He might be offered a job
in the government

855
01:10:08,904 --> 01:10:10,735
It's better than being in the street

856
01:10:11,907 --> 01:10:14,842
Old gentleman,just mind your own business

857
01:10:14,944 --> 01:10:16,673
I know this young guy

858
01:10:16,779 --> 01:10:19,043
His name is Zhou Reqing

859
01:10:19,148 --> 01:10:21,616
His uncle is Zhou Jianfeng

860
01:10:21,717 --> 01:10:22,809
Zhou Jianfeng£¿

861
01:10:23,319 --> 01:10:25,913
The one who used to work
in the lmperial Academy£¿

862
01:10:26,021 --> 01:10:28,489
Yes,he used to work there

863
01:10:28,591 --> 01:10:32,049
Now he's retired and returned to
his hometown

864
01:10:32,161 --> 01:10:37,258
Zhou is a just and virtuous official

865
01:10:37,366 --> 01:10:40,858
So he didn't make much money

866
01:10:40,970 --> 01:10:44,167
He has some paintings that could be
worth something

867
01:10:44,273 --> 01:10:46,366
But he insists not to sell them

868
01:10:46,475 --> 01:10:49,706
His nephew is now supporting him

869
01:10:49,812 --> 01:10:52,246
But Reqing is not working hard enough

870
01:10:52,348 --> 01:10:53,906
He doesn't care about his business

871
01:10:54,016 --> 01:10:55,745
And keeps studying all day

872
01:10:55,851 --> 01:10:58,411
Always talking about books

873
01:10:58,520 --> 01:11:02,012
If he doesn't study,he practices
martial arts

874
01:11:02,124 --> 01:11:04,456
Thinking he's both a literary and
martial arts master

875
01:11:04,560 --> 01:11:08,087
He has such pride and ambition

876
01:11:08,197 --> 01:11:10,495
If you give him the job of
a military general

877
01:11:10,599 --> 01:11:12,499
He might think this is too trivial for him

878
01:11:12,601 --> 01:11:15,399
He has high aspirations but
he's unfortunate

879
01:11:15,504 --> 01:11:17,904
He can't earn his capital back

880
01:11:18,007 --> 01:11:20,737
Let alone making a profit

881
01:11:20,843 --> 01:11:23,471
He also owes huge debts

882
01:11:23,579 --> 01:11:25,342
Trouble will find its way to him

883
01:11:25,447 --> 01:11:29,645
I think you should forget about this guy

884
01:11:30,886 --> 01:11:32,820
Military general

885
01:11:33,522 --> 01:11:35,513
Veggie military general

886
01:11:35,624 --> 01:11:37,091
Carrot military general

887
01:11:38,761 --> 01:11:40,820
See,I told ya trouble will find him

888
01:11:40,929 --> 01:11:42,396
Now here comes the trouble

889
01:11:47,436 --> 01:11:48,664
Officers

890
01:11:49,738 --> 01:11:52,206
You should pay up now,shouldn't you£¿

891
01:11:52,308 --> 01:11:53,468
I don't have the money

892
01:11:55,344 --> 01:11:58,711
No money£¿ And you're studying here,
bastard

893
01:11:58,814 --> 01:12:00,213
Why don't you do your business now£¿

894
01:12:00,316 --> 01:12:01,806
Yes¡­

895
01:12:04,953 --> 01:12:06,147
I am going to do business now

896
01:12:07,956 --> 01:12:09,981
What£¿ You're not convinced

897
01:12:25,107 --> 01:12:26,734
This is too much

898
01:12:28,010 --> 01:12:32,037
This is the fifth day,5 dollars a day

899
01:12:32,147 --> 01:12:35,514
The total adds up to 25 dollars

900
01:12:35,617 --> 01:12:37,141
It'll be 30 tomorrow

901
01:12:37,252 --> 01:12:38,514
So how about paying up¡­

902
01:12:38,620 --> 01:12:39,746
the 25 dollars today£¿

903
01:12:39,988 --> 01:12:41,012
Do you hear me£¿

904
01:12:41,824 --> 01:12:43,917
Please,I really have no money

905
01:12:44,026 --> 01:12:46,620
What do you mean by no money£¿

906
01:12:46,729 --> 01:12:48,993
We wouldn't have a cent if everyone
was like you

907
01:12:49,698 --> 01:12:52,724
I know you're poor so I let you delay
for a few days

908
01:12:52,835 --> 01:12:54,928
But now you're delaying day after day

909
01:12:55,037 --> 01:12:57,062
Every day you say ¡°tomorrow¡±

910
01:12:57,172 --> 01:12:58,230
What kind of tricks you're playing

911
01:12:58,640 --> 01:12:59,572
I'm not playing tricks

912
01:12:59,675 --> 01:13:02,041
See,I can't even sell vegetables

913
01:13:02,745 --> 01:13:03,803
Can't sell£¿

914
01:13:04,613 --> 01:13:06,103
Then why don't you just go
and sell them now£¿

915
01:13:07,983 --> 01:13:11,714
Study£¿ If people like you can study

916
01:13:11,820 --> 01:13:13,481
Then everyone can be an official

917
01:13:13,889 --> 01:13:17,347
If you can study,you can be the emperor

918
01:13:17,826 --> 01:13:18,850
Now give me the money

919
01:13:18,961 --> 01:13:21,862
Sorry¡­my uncle is sick

920
01:13:21,964 --> 01:13:24,125
I need the money to buy medicine for him

921
01:13:24,233 --> 01:13:25,393
If he could get well again¡­

922
01:13:25,501 --> 01:13:26,399
No

923
01:13:26,769 --> 01:13:28,896
If you don't pay,you can't leave

924
01:13:29,004 --> 01:13:30,733
Officers,please be kind¡­

925
01:13:30,839 --> 01:13:33,501
What£¿ Let me tell you

926
01:13:33,609 --> 01:13:36,407
It's no use to delay

927
01:13:36,512 --> 01:13:39,709
Tomorrow is the 6th day,
day after tomorrow is 7th

928
01:13:39,815 --> 01:13:42,375
Your debt rolls bigger and bigger,
like a snowball

929
01:13:42,484 --> 01:13:44,349
If you pay a little today and
a little tomorrow

930
01:13:44,453 --> 01:13:46,045
Then you'll clear up your debt

931
01:13:46,155 --> 01:13:48,589
Well,we want to be kind to you

932
01:13:48,690 --> 01:13:51,659
But our situation is difficult too

933
01:13:51,760 --> 01:13:53,091
Our supervisors think
we've spent the money

934
01:13:53,195 --> 01:13:54,492
In fact we haven't got any

935
01:13:54,596 --> 01:13:55,654
If everyone delays like you

936
01:13:55,764 --> 01:13:57,527
Then we'll be finished

937
01:13:57,633 --> 01:13:58,224
You have to understand that

938
01:13:58,333 --> 01:14:00,733
We can't spend event a cent of this money

939
01:14:00,836 --> 01:14:02,963
This is imperial taxes

940
01:14:03,071 --> 01:14:04,971
All the money has to go to Beijing

941
01:14:05,073 --> 01:14:06,802
And be given to Emperor Chien Lung
to spend

942
01:14:08,110 --> 01:14:11,910
What money£¿ For me to spend£¿

943
01:14:12,014 --> 01:14:13,413
I never use this money

944
01:14:14,716 --> 01:14:15,774
It's so strange

945
01:14:15,884 --> 01:14:16,316
Waiter

946
01:14:19,988 --> 01:14:21,182
Old gentleman,what's the matter£¿

947
01:14:22,558 --> 01:14:24,321
What kind of money they're collecting
downstairs£¿

948
01:14:26,028 --> 01:14:28,155
This£¿ Downstairs£¿

949
01:14:29,932 --> 01:14:30,990
What money£¿

950
01:14:31,099 --> 01:14:32,532
What money£¿ You tell me

951
01:14:33,735 --> 01:14:34,963
I'll tell you

952
01:14:39,975 --> 01:14:40,737
Come here

953
01:14:44,246 --> 01:14:45,372
Come here

954
01:14:45,714 --> 01:14:46,681
You can tell me just right here

955
01:14:46,782 --> 01:14:48,477
Why are you being so stealthy£¿

956
01:14:48,851 --> 01:14:50,842
ldiot,just come with me

957
01:14:51,453 --> 01:14:53,045
I want you to tell me right here

958
01:14:53,422 --> 01:14:54,912
You idiot,come here

959
01:14:58,894 --> 01:15:00,987
Come¡­

960
01:15:01,930 --> 01:15:03,591
Come¡­

961
01:15:03,699 --> 01:15:04,563
Come here

962
01:15:06,935 --> 01:15:08,163
Come here

963
01:15:09,238 --> 01:15:10,500
This money¡­

964
01:15:15,477 --> 01:15:17,968
Come here

965
01:15:19,281 --> 01:15:20,248
Come here

966
01:15:22,150 --> 01:15:24,277
Sit down¡­

967
01:15:24,386 --> 01:15:26,149
Tell me,what's this money for£¿

968
01:15:26,255 --> 01:15:28,314
Old gentleman,this money

969
01:15:28,423 --> 01:15:30,721
I'm okay if I didn't talk about it

970
01:15:30,826 --> 01:15:33,693
When I start talking about it
I'm getting angry

971
01:15:34,062 --> 01:15:35,529
What's this money for£¿ Tell me

972
01:15:35,631 --> 01:15:37,861
You can't blame other people

973
01:15:37,966 --> 01:15:41,595
But that Emperor Chien Lung,
son-of-a-bitch

974
01:15:41,703 --> 01:15:44,001
He gives us citizens a hard time

975
01:15:44,106 --> 01:15:46,472
I wonder how such an emperor

976
01:15:46,575 --> 01:15:48,600
will die in the future

977
01:15:50,178 --> 01:15:52,203
Don't curse people

978
01:15:52,314 --> 01:15:54,111
Why are you cursing people£¿

979
01:15:54,216 --> 01:15:55,342
Honestly

980
01:15:55,450 --> 01:15:56,747
Well,this is me

981
01:15:56,852 --> 01:15:58,717
I only curse those who deserve
to be cursed

982
01:15:58,820 --> 01:16:02,119
Honestly,even if Emperor Chien Lung
was here

983
01:16:02,224 --> 01:16:04,556
I won't shut up. I won't be polite to him

984
01:16:07,362 --> 01:16:08,829
That son of a bitch

985
01:16:10,232 --> 01:16:13,759
Tell me,what's that money for£¿

986
01:16:14,770 --> 01:16:16,328
This money¡­

987
01:16:26,481 --> 01:16:29,382
Actually we didn't have to pay
this money before

988
01:16:29,484 --> 01:16:34,353
Last spring,when Emperor Chien Lung

989
01:16:34,456 --> 01:16:37,857
was having fun in his imperial palace

990
01:16:37,960 --> 01:16:41,657
He passed an order

991
01:16:41,763 --> 01:16:46,894
Shit,this emperor really spends
a lot of money

992
01:16:49,972 --> 01:16:51,633
On what would be spend so much on£¿

993
01:16:52,708 --> 01:16:58,146
Shit,he has dozens of imperial concubines

994
01:16:58,246 --> 01:17:02,512
They have shark's fin and
other delicacies every day

995
01:17:02,618 --> 01:17:05,348
There's not enough money
in the national treasure

996
01:17:05,454 --> 01:17:09,914
And he knows that Yangzhou
is a wealthy place

997
01:17:10,025 --> 01:17:12,926
So he sends over a minister

998
01:17:13,028 --> 01:17:14,427
Ye Hongjun

999
01:17:14,529 --> 01:17:17,327
To come here and set up a tax office

1000
01:17:17,432 --> 01:17:18,899
Tax office£¿

1001
01:17:19,501 --> 01:17:22,197
Everyone doing business has to pay tax

1002
01:17:22,304 --> 01:17:25,364
Shop proprietors have to pay 100 dollars

1003
01:17:25,474 --> 01:17:27,442
Or maybe 50 dollars

1004
01:17:27,542 --> 01:17:30,409
Those small businesses and hawkers

1005
01:17:30,512 --> 01:17:32,605
They might have to pay 10 to 20 dollars

1006
01:17:32,714 --> 01:17:35,979
Even the smallest business has to pay tax

1007
01:17:36,084 --> 01:17:38,917
He has to pay at least 5 dollars

1008
01:17:39,021 --> 01:17:43,253
If you didn't have 5 dollars
you couldn't do business

1009
01:17:43,358 --> 01:17:45,849
When the money is collected

1010
01:17:45,961 --> 01:17:49,294
Every cent is sent to Beijing for
Chien Lung's pleasure

1011
01:17:49,398 --> 01:17:52,390
Old gentleman,not only Yangzhou

1012
01:17:52,501 --> 01:17:54,366
It'd be okay even if it's just Yangzhou

1013
01:17:54,469 --> 01:17:56,664
Even areas around Yangzhou have to pay tax

1014
01:17:56,772 --> 01:18:01,300
You see,this is a huge amount of income

1015
01:18:01,410 --> 01:18:03,344
The taxing period was for a year

1016
01:18:03,445 --> 01:18:06,812
From last spring to this spring

1017
01:18:06,915 --> 01:18:08,576
Now Dragon Boat Festival is approaching

1018
01:18:08,684 --> 01:18:13,644
And he's still getting good money

1019
01:18:13,755 --> 01:18:15,985
So the period is extended for another year

1020
01:18:16,091 --> 01:18:21,188
Then the people will have
more difficult times

1021
01:18:21,296 --> 01:18:25,528
Old gentleman,do you still think
I'm wrong£¿

1022
01:18:25,634 --> 01:18:29,661
Son of a bitch,bastard

1023
01:18:30,539 --> 01:18:33,906
Damn it,bastard

1024
01:18:34,009 --> 01:18:35,704
If I had used this money

1025
01:18:35,811 --> 01:18:37,244
I really deserve to be cursed

1026
01:18:37,345 --> 01:18:39,870
But I'd never use a cent

1027
01:18:39,981 --> 01:18:44,577
You£¿ It's good if he gave you some

1028
01:18:57,766 --> 01:19:00,200
Officer,please give me a few more days

1029
01:19:00,302 --> 01:19:02,600
How much should he pay£¿
I'll pay for him first

1030
01:19:02,704 --> 01:19:06,196
You'll pay for him£¿ You have a big family

1031
01:19:06,308 --> 01:19:07,240
How can you pay for him£¿

1032
01:19:08,009 --> 01:19:10,239
It's none of your business,get lost

1033
01:19:25,093 --> 01:19:25,889
Son of a bitch

1034
01:19:43,745 --> 01:19:45,713
Give me the money

1035
01:19:45,814 --> 01:19:46,974
I don't have any

1036
01:19:47,082 --> 01:19:48,242
No£¿

1037
01:19:48,350 --> 01:19:49,874
No

1038
01:19:49,985 --> 01:19:51,247
Even if you beat me to death

1039
01:19:51,353 --> 01:19:53,344
You really want to die£¿

1040
01:19:53,455 --> 01:19:54,717
I have no money

1041
01:19:54,823 --> 01:19:56,051
You sure have a lot of nerve !

1042
01:19:56,158 --> 01:19:57,056
I have no money

1043
01:19:59,394 --> 01:20:04,457
Good

1044
01:20:06,101 --> 01:20:12,131
Good¡­very good

1045
01:20:18,613 --> 01:20:20,137
Want to fight back£¿

1046
01:20:22,317 --> 01:20:23,249
What are you doing£¿

1047
01:20:33,829 --> 01:20:34,693

Good

01:20:44,072 --> 01:20:45,630
Left strike,right strike

1051
01:20:49,845 --> 01:20:50,834
Don't look like a fool

1052
01:20:52,514 --> 01:20:53,981
Good,good strike

1053
01:20:54,082 --> 01:20:54,912
Son of a bitch

1054
01:20:55,016 --> 01:20:55,880
Watch your back

1055
01:20:57,352 --> 01:20:58,444
Be careful

1056
01:21:06,728 --> 01:21:07,820
Five Phoenix Facing the Sun

1057
01:21:09,297 --> 01:21:10,161
Monkey stealing the Peach

1058
01:21:14,936 --> 01:21:15,960
Good

1059
01:21:17,439 --> 01:21:19,737
A turtle rolling over the door

1060
01:21:28,116 --> 01:21:29,276
Shit,I'll kill you

1061
01:21:30,085 --> 01:21:30,710
At your back

1062

Good¡­beat him¡­good¡­

1064
01:21:53,541 --> 01:21:55,099
I am going to bring you food

1065
01:21:57,646 --> 01:21:58,670
Son of a bitch

1066
01:21:59,281 --> 01:22:02,808
Go¡­get lost¡­

1067
01:22:03,118 --> 01:22:04,847
Who's yelling£¿ Who's there£¿

1068
01:22:05,453 --> 01:22:07,421
Come over,come over now

1069
01:22:07,856 --> 01:22:09,118
Who's yelling£¿

1070
01:22:10,759 --> 01:22:14,991
Crab dumplings with 3 extras

1071
01:23:05,213 --> 01:23:07,545
Don't you know there's a dish
in the imperial banquet£¿

1072
01:23:07,649 --> 01:23:08,547
What dish£¿

1073
01:23:08,650 --> 01:23:11,778
Make a hole in the center of the table

1074
01:23:11,886 --> 01:23:14,252
A head pokes out,strike it with a hammer

1075
01:23:14,356 --> 01:23:16,324
Use a spoon to have some fresh brain

1076
01:23:16,424 --> 01:23:16,822
Human brain£¿

1077

No¡­monkey brain

1078
01:23:21,496 --> 01:23:25,091
Take that table away

1079
01:23:25,467 --> 01:23:29,096
Take it away now

1080
01:23:29,204 --> 01:23:33,004
Chief,I would take it away if I could

1081
01:23:33,108 --> 01:23:34,302
But it's stuck on you

1082
01:23:35,210 --> 01:23:37,178
It does have a hole at the center

1083
01:23:37,278 --> 01:23:39,269
Bring it back and have a hot pot then

1084
01:23:49,157 --> 01:23:50,146
Bullshit

1085
01:23:53,161 --> 01:23:55,755
This is bullshit,son of a bitch

1086
01:24:23,191 --> 01:24:23,919
It's you£¿

1087
01:24:24,025 --> 01:24:24,491
It's me

1088
01:24:24,592 --> 01:24:25,217
Well done

1089
01:24:43,111 --> 01:24:44,078
Come on

1090
01:24:45,280 --> 01:24:47,305
Kid,if you did have guts,don't go

1091
01:24:49,117 --> 01:24:50,846
Come here,I'm waiting

1092
01:24:51,352 --> 01:24:53,445
I dare pull the emperor down
even if I have to die

1093
01:25:30,692 --> 01:25:32,159
Bastard

1094
01:25:32,260 --> 01:25:34,091
Old gentleman,it isn't the bastard

1095
01:25:34,195 --> 01:25:35,594
It's getting lost

1096
01:25:37,499 --> 01:25:39,364
Kid,let's have tea

1097

I¡­

1099
01:25:42,937 --> 01:25:45,838
Old gentleman,I can't have tea with you

1100
01:25:45,940 --> 01:25:47,202
It doesn't matter. Come¡­

1101
01:25:47,675 --> 01:25:49,302
Old gentleman,I don't want to¡­

1102
01:25:49,410 --> 01:25:51,537
Forget it,come and have tea with me

1103
01:25:58,586 --> 01:25:59,644
It's closed

1104
01:26:32,220 --> 01:26:33,482
Old gentleman

1105
01:26:33,588 --> 01:26:36,284
Thank you for helping us

1106
01:26:37,392 --> 01:26:40,054
But this is big trouble you've made

1107
01:26:40,161 --> 01:26:43,221
It's because of me,it has nothing
to do with you

1108
01:26:43,331 --> 01:26:45,060
I'll take all the responsibility

1109
01:26:45,166 --> 01:26:48,499
Please leave now or you'll be in trouble

1110
01:26:49,337 --> 01:26:51,032
What£¿

1111
01:26:51,139 --> 01:26:57,078
I'm a colleague of your uncle
in the lmperial Academy

1112
01:26:57,178 --> 01:27:00,045

1114
01:27:01,716 --> 01:27:04,947
No,old gentleman,I'll be responsible

1115
01:27:05,053 --> 01:27:07,647
I dare pull the emperor down
even if I have to die

1116
01:27:12,327 --> 01:27:15,387
Old gentleman,my uncle is sick now

1117
01:27:15,496 --> 01:27:17,657
If something happened to me

1118
01:27:17,765 --> 01:27:20,666
Please help me to take care of him

1119
01:27:20,768 --> 01:27:23,032
Because you're his ex-colleague

1120
01:27:23,137 --> 01:27:25,230
I'll pay back your generosity

1121
01:27:25,340 --> 01:27:27,331
in the hereafter

1122
01:27:28,009 --> 01:27:30,739
Get up¡­

1123
01:27:31,879 --> 01:27:35,474
Let's get inside and have some tea

1124
01:27:35,583 --> 01:27:36,345
And get some rest too

1125
01:27:46,194 --> 01:27:48,162
Open up¡­

1126
01:28:04,479 --> 01:28:08,313
Old gentleman,you both have to leave now

1127
01:28:08,416 --> 01:28:09,610
I can't be responsible

1128
01:28:09,717 --> 01:28:11,742
For the trouble you've made

1129
01:28:12,353 --> 01:28:16,312
Don't worry,we just want some tea

1130
01:28:18,559 --> 01:28:22,188
Tea£¿ We have family events today

1131
01:28:22,297 --> 01:28:24,231
And we're closed

1132
01:28:28,403 --> 01:28:30,633
Don't worry

1133
01:28:30,738 --> 01:28:32,638
I'll take care of everything

1134
01:28:32,740 --> 01:28:34,435
You£¿

1135
01:28:36,044 --> 01:28:39,480
Are you serious£¿

1136
01:28:42,083 --> 01:28:44,381
Well,I haven't paid my bill

1137
01:28:44,485 --> 01:28:47,716
The boss said it's on him

1138
01:28:50,391 --> 01:28:51,983
How about those broken things£¿

1139
01:28:52,093 --> 01:28:54,186
They can't be just broken like that

1140
01:28:54,295 --> 01:28:57,264
I'll pay for them too. Tell me how much

1141
01:28:57,365 --> 01:29:02,860
The boss said

1142
01:29:02,970 --> 01:29:04,835
You don't have to pay for those things

1143
01:29:04,939 --> 01:29:07,806
We're just having bad luck

1144
01:29:08,376 --> 01:29:11,903
To be born in such a bad time

1145
01:29:12,013 --> 01:29:15,278
With such a bastard emperor

1146
01:29:15,383 --> 01:29:18,409
Son of a bitch

1147
01:29:20,822 --> 01:29:23,222
Why¡­are you cursing again£¿

1148
01:29:24,359 --> 01:29:29,319
Dear old gentleman,let me tell you

1149
01:29:29,430 --> 01:29:33,594
If you're lucky you would have
a good emperor

1150
01:29:33,701 --> 01:29:38,035
The country would be peaceful
and prosperous

1151
01:29:38,139 --> 01:29:42,337
But now we have this shitty
Emperor Chien Lung

1152
01:29:42,777 --> 01:29:44,438
This Chien Lung

1153
01:29:44,946 --> 01:29:47,744
Chien Lung means ¡°too much dryness¡±

1154
01:29:47,849 --> 01:29:50,511
All the water is drunk by him alone

1155
01:29:50,618 --> 01:29:53,951
And we're all finished

1156
01:29:54,522 --> 01:29:57,514
Chien Lung is really awful

1157
01:29:59,260 --> 01:30:01,592
When he comes over

1158
01:30:02,730 --> 01:30:06,257
Don't even think of having water

1159
01:30:06,367 --> 01:30:10,133
Let alone having tea,old gentleman

1160
01:30:12,039 --> 01:30:15,133
Please bring us two stools

1161
01:30:15,243 --> 01:30:16,073
Stools£¿

1162
01:30:18,079 --> 01:30:23,244
What you should have is the prison

1163
01:30:23,351 --> 01:30:28,516
Even if you don't want to be there

1164
01:30:30,191 --> 01:30:31,055
Bastard

1165
01:30:42,069 --> 01:30:43,195
Old gentleman,please sit here

1166
01:30:43,304 --> 01:30:44,066
Okay¡­

1167
01:30:49,243 --> 01:30:51,040
Why are you sitting here£¿

1168
01:30:52,947 --> 01:30:55,211
Would you please sit somewhere else£¿

1169
01:30:55,316 --> 01:30:57,546
People have to go through this door

1170
01:30:59,620 --> 01:31:00,382
Okay

1171
01:31:15,636 --> 01:31:19,800
Old gentleman,this is a doorway

1172
01:31:19,907 --> 01:31:24,139
We have to use this doorway,
please go away

1173
01:31:24,745 --> 01:31:25,939
It's just minor trouble

1174
01:31:26,047 --> 01:31:29,210
See¡­you're so frightened

1175
01:31:29,317 --> 01:31:32,946
Minor trouble£¿ It's not minor,
dear old gentleman

1176
01:31:33,454 --> 01:31:35,547
You see,this big building

1177
01:31:35,656 --> 01:31:38,022
is almost torn down by you

1178
01:31:38,926 --> 01:31:40,985
Listen

1179
01:31:41,095 --> 01:31:43,928
You've interfered officers' duty

1180
01:31:44,031 --> 01:31:47,467
And you've beaten them,this is
against the law

1181
01:31:47,568 --> 01:31:50,469
And you've disturbed public order

1182
01:31:50,571 --> 01:31:54,439
Now you're sitting here and
this is loitering

1183
01:31:54,542 --> 01:31:58,342
If you don't have to be executed
for these crimes

1184
01:31:58,446 --> 01:32:00,937
At least you have to stay in jail for life

1185
01:32:01,048 --> 01:32:03,107
Please,old gentleman

1186
01:32:03,217 --> 01:32:05,447
If you don't want to leave

1187
01:32:05,553 --> 01:32:07,180
At least you keep the way clear,okay£¿

1188
01:32:07,288 --> 01:32:10,018
Okay,I don't want to bring trouble to you

1189
01:32:13,728 --> 01:32:14,660
So I'll sit in the middle of the road

1190
01:32:15,496 --> 01:32:18,192
This should be okay,bastard

1191
01:32:20,468 --> 01:32:23,631
You're obstructing traffic,
it's an offense too

1192
01:32:34,582 --> 01:32:35,549
It's them

1193
01:32:36,551 --> 01:32:37,813
Is that him£¿

1194
01:32:37,919 --> 01:32:38,544
Yes

1195
01:32:42,523 --> 01:32:43,182
It's me

1196
01:32:44,025 --> 01:32:44,957
It's you£¿

1197
01:32:45,726 --> 01:32:49,093
None of your business,ignore him

1198
01:32:49,697 --> 01:32:51,722
I'll be responsible for everything

1199
01:32:53,034 --> 01:32:54,729
How dare you

1200
01:32:57,004 --> 01:32:58,471
Who make the first move£¿

1201
01:32:58,573 --> 01:33:00,666
Both of them

1202
01:33:00,775 --> 01:33:02,606
It's him,he made the first move

1203
01:33:03,911 --> 01:33:05,902
Want to disobey government officials,
right£¿

1204
01:33:06,013 --> 01:33:08,777
And dare to beat up police officers

1205
01:33:09,183 --> 01:33:10,582
State your names and where you're from

1206
01:33:12,386 --> 01:33:16,584
I'm Gao Tianci

1207
01:33:16,691 --> 01:33:19,421
From Beijing

1208
01:33:22,029 --> 01:33:26,261
Are you Ye Hongjun of the tax office£¿

1209
01:33:27,201 --> 01:33:29,829
You're impolite to call my name
and title like that

1210
01:33:31,706 --> 01:33:35,642
You do have some nerve,Ye Hongjun

1211
01:33:35,743 --> 01:33:38,405
You're lying about the Emperor's order

1212
01:33:38,512 --> 01:33:40,480
And collect taxes for your private use

1213
01:33:42,116 --> 01:33:44,641
This is very serious,don't you know£¿

1214
01:33:45,019 --> 01:33:47,954
Master¡­

1215
01:33:49,357 --> 01:33:50,381
Master

1216
01:33:56,998 --> 01:33:58,295
Who is this guy£¿

1217
01:33:58,399 --> 01:33:59,866
I don't know who he is

1218
01:34:00,468 --> 01:34:03,301
What's his background£¿
What's he doing here£¿

1219
01:34:03,404 --> 01:34:07,101
He has Beijing accent,his name is
Gao Tianci

1220
01:34:07,208 --> 01:34:08,675
Gao Tianci£¿

1221
01:34:08,776 --> 01:34:10,471
There's an implication in his speech

1222
01:34:10,578 --> 01:34:12,944
He must be sent by Beijing

1223
01:34:13,047 --> 01:34:14,412
He's from Beijing£¿

1224
01:34:17,618 --> 01:34:19,779
Looks like he's the Emperor

1225
01:34:20,221 --> 01:34:23,088
The Emperor£¿ You've met him,don't you£¿

1226
01:34:23,190 --> 01:34:23,713
Yes

1227
01:34:23,824 --> 01:34:24,813
Take a closer look

1228
01:34:24,925 --> 01:34:25,983
I'll take a good look

1229
01:34:39,540 --> 01:34:40,370
Isn't he the Emperor£¿

1230
01:34:40,474 --> 01:34:41,736
I'm not sure

1231
01:34:41,842 --> 01:34:43,605
He's just right here and you're not sure£¿

1232
01:34:43,711 --> 01:34:45,235
It's too close

1233
01:34:45,346 --> 01:34:48,281
When I met the Emperor,he was miles away

1234
01:34:51,252 --> 01:34:52,514
Then stay further

1235
01:35:35,062 --> 01:35:36,029
Isn't he the Emperor£¿

1236
01:35:36,831 --> 01:35:39,698
If he's not the Emperor,who could he be£¿

1237
01:35:53,481 --> 01:35:54,311
Your Majesty

1238
01:36:02,556 --> 01:36:05,889
Rong An is late,please forgive me

1239
01:36:07,895 --> 01:36:11,092
Long live Your Majesty

1240
01:36:23,511 --> 01:36:24,341
Your Majesty

1241
01:37:23,571 --> 01:37:26,836
Now I am a ¡°shuai lao¡±

1242
01:37:30,311 --> 01:37:32,245
I'm a ¡°shuai lao¡±

1243
01:37:38,919 --> 01:37:39,908
Arise¡­

1244
01:37:45,392 --> 01:37:51,661
Old gentleman¡­no¡­Your Majesty

1245
01:37:51,999 --> 01:37:53,057
Don't be afraid

1246
01:37:53,634 --> 01:37:57,832
I come here to look for virtuous people

1247
01:37:57,938 --> 01:38:03,001
And to understand the lives of my people

1248
01:38:03,110 --> 01:38:07,979
And I want my people to know more about me

1249
01:38:09,483 --> 01:38:14,182
You didn't know who I am,so I'm not
mad at you

1250
01:38:17,324 --> 01:38:18,313
Zhou Riqing

1251
01:38:20,327 --> 01:38:20,986
Yes

1252
01:38:21,662 --> 01:38:26,326
You just said even if you have to die

1253
01:38:26,700 --> 01:38:27,826
What's next£¿

1254
01:38:31,405 --> 01:38:35,136
I'll pull the horse for the Emperor

1255
01:38:37,578 --> 01:38:38,442
Good

1256
01:39:07,041 --> 01:39:10,067
The 11th month of the 1 6th year
of Chien Lung's reign

1257
01:39:10,177 --> 01:39:13,044
¡­was the Queen Mother's
60th birthday celebration

1258
01:39:13,147 --> 01:39:15,172
At her birthday banquet
all the common people

1259
01:39:15,282 --> 01:39:19,548
were as drunk as if they were some lords

1260
01:39:19,653 --> 01:39:21,883
Chien Lung was 41 at that time

1261
01:39:21,989 --> 01:39:24,617
It was 1752A.D.
