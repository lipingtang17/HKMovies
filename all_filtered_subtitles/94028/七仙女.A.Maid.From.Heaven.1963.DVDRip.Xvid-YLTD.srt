0
00:03:24,237 --> 00:03:37,105
Over here in heaven
life feels so very dull!

1
00:03:40,353 --> 00:03:53,994
Got nothing better to do
but count the floating clouds

2
00:03:54,100 --> 00:04:01,268
Elder sister often sings
praises of the mortal world

3
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:13,482
Where the men farm, the women weave

4
00:04:13,586 --> 00:04:22,119
I'd sure like to take a peek

5
00:04:22,228 --> 00:04:32,536
But it's father's wrath that I fear so

6
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:40,004
Let me go and look for my eldest sister

7
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:44,641
Perhaps she'd offer some advice

8
00:04:44,751 --> 00:04:53,682
She would have some ideas

9
00:05:00,933 --> 00:05:04,664
Eldest sister...

10
00:05:09,742 --> 00:05:12,142
Eldest sister...

11
00:05:12,245 --> 00:05:14,213
Eldest sister, I want to...

12
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:16,646
I know what it s that you want. But...

13
00:05:16,749 --> 00:05:20,480
it's against heavenly rules
to take a peek at earth

14
00:05:20,586 --> 00:05:22,315
If our father finds out...

15
00:05:22,422 --> 00:05:24,287
We'll get into trouble

16
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:27,188
Let's make sure he doesn't come to know

17
00:05:27,293 --> 00:05:30,091
It's not a big deal
to take a peek at earth

18
00:05:30,196 --> 00:05:32,824
Yes, let's take a peek

19
00:05:33,633 --> 00:05:35,931
Come with me then

20
00:06:05,598 --> 00:06:07,327
Seventh sister's idea is great indeed

21
00:06:07,433 --> 00:06:10,368
The mortal world is much more interesting

22
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:11,596
Hey, stop talking

23
00:06:11,704 --> 00:06:15,640
Our father will kill us if he finds out

24
00:06:16,809 --> 00:06:20,074
Look, eldest sister...
who are those people?

25
00:06:28,154 --> 00:06:29,746
Those are fishermen

26
00:06:29,856 --> 00:06:30,982
Fishermen?

27
00:06:31,724 --> 00:06:33,555
Let me sing something in their praise

28
00:06:41,434 --> 00:06:45,632
Fishermen fishing
in the middle of the sea

29
00:06:45,738 --> 00:06:48,502
Middle of the sea

30
00:06:51,677 --> 00:06:57,547
Sailing on lakes and seas

31
00:06:59,185 --> 00:07:02,985
Selling half of the catch for wine

32
00:07:09,862 --> 00:07:16,062
...and the other half for rice

33
00:07:16,169 --> 00:07:19,036
For rice

34
00:07:27,313 --> 00:07:28,575
Look

35
00:07:32,418 --> 00:07:34,318
A woodcutter

36
00:07:34,687 --> 00:07:37,281
I'll sing in his praise too

37
00:07:46,265 --> 00:07:52,465
The woodcutter sings and cuts the wood

38
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:59,275
Walking down the hill after a day's work

39
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:03,606
Selling the firewood on the main street

40
00:08:03,716 --> 00:08:05,911
On the main street

41
00:08:15,862 --> 00:08:23,826
To buy food and be content

42
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,832
Listen to this

43
00:08:28,941 --> 00:08:31,273
The farmers work hard in the fields

44
00:08:31,377 --> 00:08:34,005
Work hard in the fields

45
00:08:38,951 --> 00:08:44,753
Sowed seeds of grains, rice and wheat

46
00:08:48,995 --> 00:08:52,897
Hoping & praying for a good harvest

47
00:09:09,348 --> 00:09:15,287
A good harvest and happiness

48
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:18,653
Happiness

49
00:09:32,538 --> 00:09:34,130
Listen to me

50
00:09:54,160 --> 00:10:04,502
The scholar studies by the window

51
00:10:05,338 --> 00:10:13,746
Reciting the literature

52
00:10:16,849 --> 00:10:23,084
He must learn
the Four Books and Five Classics

53
00:10:23,189 --> 00:10:30,618
A man should be ambitious

54
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:33,790
Ambitious

55
00:11:02,395 --> 00:11:17,368
It's such a different world

56
00:11:19,712 --> 00:11:25,412
Happy couples tying the knot

57
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:29,113
Tying the knot

58
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:37,322
The bridal sedan picks up the bride

59
00:11:46,706 --> 00:12:00,018
It will take her to the bridal chamber

60
00:12:06,659 --> 00:12:08,286
Hey, look

61
00:12:09,762 --> 00:12:12,993
Sister, why is that young man
in such a hurry?

62
00:12:13,099 --> 00:12:15,158
Do you know why?

63
00:12:16,001 --> 00:12:17,832
His name is Tong Yong

64
00:12:17,937 --> 00:12:21,065
His father passed away;
having no money for...

65
00:12:21,173 --> 00:12:22,834
the funeral, he sold himself
to work as a slave

66
00:12:22,942 --> 00:12:25,001
He's heading to work now

67
00:12:28,047 --> 00:12:30,515
He is a filial son

68
00:12:31,817 --> 00:12:34,786
But he's all alone

69
00:12:34,887 --> 00:12:36,912
Poor chap!

70
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:43,520
Let's go back to the palace

71
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:17,253
The bells are urging my sisters
to rush back home

72
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:36,380
Let me take a second look at Tong Yong

73
00:13:47,493 --> 00:14:02,033
Working as a slave
to raise money for burial

74
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:21,586
Wondering if & ever
he could get back home

75
00:14:30,336 --> 00:14:39,142
He seems like an honest man

76
00:14:39,245 --> 00:14:53,114
I sympathize for him

77
00:14:53,225 --> 00:14:56,820
He's worried on earth

78
00:14:56,929 --> 00:15:02,492
I'm unhappy

79
00:15:02,601 --> 00:15:09,165
He's crying

80
00:15:09,275 --> 00:15:16,909
I'm grieved

81
00:15:18,884 --> 00:15:23,218
I desire to go to the mortal world

82
00:15:23,322 --> 00:15:27,019
But I'm afraid of my strict father

83
00:15:27,126 --> 00:15:31,153
If I don't go

84
00:15:31,263 --> 00:15:40,729
Then I'll be alone forever

85
00:15:43,542 --> 00:15:44,531
Um... Eldest sister

86
00:15:44,643 --> 00:15:49,205
Seventh sister,
I know what you're thinking about

87
00:15:49,315 --> 00:15:51,647
I've gone through the same experience

88
00:15:52,685 --> 00:15:55,848
But if our father finds out...

89
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:58,822
You must help me, sister

90
00:16:02,328 --> 00:16:04,489
The rules are stern

91
00:16:04,596 --> 00:16:07,394
I've made up my mind

92
00:16:07,499 --> 00:16:09,364
I'll break the rules if I must

93
00:16:11,337 --> 00:16:15,831
You're too young; I'm so worried

94
00:16:15,941 --> 00:16:17,306
Eldest sister

95
00:16:18,711 --> 00:16:19,939
C'mon, get up

96
00:16:20,045 --> 00:16:21,876
I won't if you don't promise me

97
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:23,039
Fine

98
00:16:23,148 --> 00:16:24,308
Really?

99
00:16:24,416 --> 00:16:26,247
Yes, get up

100
00:16:32,558 --> 00:16:35,026
But...

101
00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:40,088
How about this?

102
00:16:42,334 --> 00:16:44,131
Here's an incense stick

103
00:16:44,236 --> 00:16:46,864
If you're in trouble, burn this

104
00:16:46,972 --> 00:16:50,567
The six of us will come to your help

105
00:16:51,877 --> 00:16:56,337
Thanking my sister for her goodwill

106
00:16:56,448 --> 00:17:02,717
She helped and gave me the incense stick

107
00:17:04,356 --> 00:17:09,157
I bid her farewell

108
00:17:13,465 --> 00:17:28,608
I hope their love will last forever

109
00:17:34,219 --> 00:17:43,526
Rays of sunlight
pierce through the clouds

110
00:17:44,997 --> 00:17:52,995
I'm on my way to the mortal world

111
00:17:53,105 --> 00:17:57,405
I don't like the life in heaven

112
00:17:57,509 --> 00:18:05,644
I'd rather be an ordinary girl in love

113
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:30,031
Where's the local earth-god?

114
00:18:40,085 --> 00:18:41,177
Respected fairy

115
00:18:41,286 --> 00:18:42,446
Oh, please arise

116
00:18:42,554 --> 00:18:46,081
What can I do for you, fairy?

117
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:13,483
Oh, this I can't... no can do

118
00:19:13,585 --> 00:19:15,018
If the Jade Emperor were to find out...

119
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:17,953
I will be in serious trouble

120
00:19:18,056 --> 00:19:19,318
Don't worry, earth god

121
00:19:19,424 --> 00:19:21,085
If my father blames anyone

122
00:19:21,193 --> 00:19:24,594
I'll take all responsibility

123
00:19:28,033 --> 00:19:29,898
Yes, fairy

124
00:19:31,703 --> 00:19:33,898
Watch your steps

125
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:40,978
Your dress could be a problem though

126
00:19:41,079 --> 00:19:44,173
Change into something
the human beings wear

127
00:20:29,928 --> 00:20:50,442
Moving forward in sorrow

128
00:20:59,424 --> 00:21:07,661
I see a village girl on the path

129
00:21:07,766 --> 00:21:13,636
What is she doing?

130
00:21:19,845 --> 00:21:28,810
She's looking at me

131
00:21:29,388 --> 00:21:41,630
But I'm in no mood for gestures

132
00:21:51,677 --> 00:22:00,415
My late father used to tell me

133
00:22:00,519 --> 00:22:13,557
Speaking to strange women
would spell trouble

134
00:22:15,267 --> 00:22:26,075
I'll take the trail then

135
00:22:45,997 --> 00:22:55,702
There she is again!

136
00:22:57,642 --> 00:23:09,577
Let me go back to the main path

137
00:23:21,466 --> 00:23:33,936
Why are you doing this?

138
00:23:39,518 --> 00:23:42,749
Lady, I don't understand

139
00:23:42,854 --> 00:23:45,049
You've blocked my way twice

140
00:23:45,157 --> 00:23:47,022
What did you do that for?

141
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:50,150
There's a saying:

142
00:23:50,262 --> 00:23:53,891
One can choose his own path

143
00:23:53,999 --> 00:23:56,160
If you can walk around

144
00:23:56,268 --> 00:23:59,499
Can't I just stand around?

145
00:24:04,943 --> 00:24:10,245
Excuse me, lady

146
00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:15,547
All right, please

147
00:24:16,421 --> 00:24:17,888
Please

148
00:24:22,828 --> 00:24:26,730
Lady, you ran into me

149
00:24:26,832 --> 00:24:29,323
You have a sack and an umbrella

150
00:24:29,434 --> 00:24:32,733
You were preoccupied and ran into me

151
00:24:32,838 --> 00:24:35,602
Are you blaming me now?

152
00:24:38,844 --> 00:24:40,243
Did I bump into her?

153
00:24:43,515 --> 00:24:47,451
Fine, please

154
00:24:48,854 --> 00:24:50,651
Please

155
00:24:56,161 --> 00:25:00,621
Lady, are you doing this on purpose?

156
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:03,333
Let me ask you

157
00:25:03,435 --> 00:25:05,596
Do you want to walk past?

158
00:25:05,704 --> 00:25:09,765
I... Of course

159
00:25:10,742 --> 00:25:12,209
Tell me then

160
00:25:12,310 --> 00:25:15,040
Where do you live? What's your name?

161
00:25:15,146 --> 00:25:16,613
Where are you heading to?

162
00:25:16,715 --> 00:25:20,014
If you tell me clearly, I'll let you pass

163
00:25:20,986 --> 00:25:23,784
Lady

164
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:37,561
My name is Tong Yong; living in Danyang

165
00:25:38,136 --> 00:25:45,668
My parents are deceased, I have no family

166
00:25:45,777 --> 00:25:52,979
I couldn't afford a proper burial
for my father

167
00:25:53,084 --> 00:25:59,250
Hence I've sold myself to work as a slave

168
00:25:59,357 --> 00:26:07,423
Full of sorrow

169
00:26:07,532 --> 00:26:17,168
I'll work for three years as a slave

170
00:26:17,275 --> 00:26:22,713
Please excuse me

171
00:26:22,814 --> 00:26:38,026
See, the sun is about to set soon

172
00:26:41,232 --> 00:26:56,239
Please don't cry, mister

173
00:26:57,816 --> 00:27:06,121
Let me give you a word of encouragement

174
00:27:06,224 --> 00:27:13,426
You're like a willow in frost

175
00:27:13,531 --> 00:27:22,769
You'll bloom again in Spring

176
00:27:22,874 --> 00:27:24,671
Thank you for your kind words

177
00:27:25,176 --> 00:27:31,342
I've a sad story too

178
00:27:31,449 --> 00:27:47,491
We're both unfortunate

179
00:27:48,233 --> 00:27:51,259
Where do you live, lady?

180
00:27:51,369 --> 00:27:54,202
Where are you heading to?

181
00:27:55,840 --> 00:28:01,801
I was living in Penglai Village

182
00:28:01,913 --> 00:28:08,409
I traveled a long way to board
with my relatives

183
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:16,689
But I can't find them anywhere

184
00:28:16,795 --> 00:28:25,100
That's why I'm here all alone

185
00:28:26,538 --> 00:28:31,441
Then we are both unfortunate

186
00:28:31,543 --> 00:28:36,947
If you wouldn't mind

187
00:28:37,048 --> 00:28:41,985
I'm willing to...

188
00:28:42,087 --> 00:28:43,349
To do what?

189
00:28:43,455 --> 00:28:53,353
Marry you

190
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:59,332
You should have thought this over

191
00:28:59,437 --> 00:29:03,373
We hardly know each other

192
00:29:03,475 --> 00:29:09,072
And I've to work as a slave
at the Fu Household

193
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:21,524
I can't let you suffer with me

194
00:29:23,161 --> 00:29:27,291
Please take me along;
then I won't wander around

195
00:29:27,398 --> 00:29:30,799
Lady, I can hardly support myself

196
00:29:30,902 --> 00:29:32,631
I don't want you to suffer too

197
00:29:32,737 --> 00:29:35,604
So you're refusing to help?

198
00:29:38,076 --> 00:29:41,876
There's nothing I can do

199
00:29:43,047 --> 00:29:44,412
Goodbye

200
00:29:46,718 --> 00:29:51,781
Mister...

201
00:29:53,892 --> 00:29:55,120
Mister

202
00:29:57,529 --> 00:30:03,092
Mister...

203
00:30:10,775 --> 00:30:13,403
Are you hurt?

204
00:30:13,578 --> 00:30:17,309
Please take me with you, mister

205
00:30:17,415 --> 00:30:18,575
I...

206
00:30:18,683 --> 00:30:21,311
Please take me with you, mister

207
00:30:21,686 --> 00:30:24,780
Lady, there's nothing I can do

208
00:30:24,889 --> 00:30:27,050
You just have to acquiesce

209
00:30:27,158 --> 00:30:29,353
No, I...

210
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:30,927
How could you be so heartless?

211
00:30:31,029 --> 00:30:33,020
Left me here wandering on my own?

212
00:30:33,131 --> 00:30:35,224
No, I...

213
00:30:35,333 --> 00:30:36,732
Please take me with you, mister

214
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:38,860
No, I...

215
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:46,141
It's so disgraceful of you both to be...

216
00:30:46,244 --> 00:30:49,213
Flirting here in the wilderness,
are you?

217
00:30:52,016 --> 00:30:53,916
You've got it all wrong, mister

218
00:30:54,018 --> 00:30:57,681
Me and her...

219
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:00,589
I get it

220
00:31:00,692 --> 00:31:05,061
A married couple having a quarrel?

221
00:31:06,397 --> 00:31:10,026
No, I'm not related to her

222
00:31:10,134 --> 00:31:11,362
And we're not married

223
00:31:11,469 --> 00:31:13,903
Mister, please don't make wild guesses

224
00:31:19,978 --> 00:31:21,343
Then why are you...

225
00:31:21,446 --> 00:31:23,812
two fighting?

226
00:31:24,649 --> 00:31:26,048
Honestly

227
00:31:26,150 --> 00:31:29,017
We've hardly made a proper acquaintance

228
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:33,022
I've only spoken briefly to her,
then she...

229
00:31:42,367 --> 00:31:43,561
What about her?

230
00:31:43,668 --> 00:31:45,101
She...

231
00:31:45,503 --> 00:31:47,300
Tell me

232
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:51,604
She wants to marry me

233
00:31:52,443 --> 00:31:54,274
To get married?

234
00:32:07,025 --> 00:32:10,483
I think you two would make a fine match

235
00:32:10,595 --> 00:32:13,996
Then you had better respond to her

236
00:32:14,732 --> 00:32:17,462
You know nothing about me

237
00:32:17,568 --> 00:32:23,666
I'm poor and am about
to start work as a slave

238
00:32:23,775 --> 00:32:26,676
I can't let her suffer with me

239
00:32:26,778 --> 00:32:29,110
Thank you for your kind suggestion

240
00:32:29,213 --> 00:32:32,080
I... really am...

241
00:32:37,221 --> 00:32:39,280
He doesn't want you to live a poor life

242
00:32:39,390 --> 00:32:41,483
He's doing it for your sake

243
00:32:41,592 --> 00:32:44,459
I think you better head back home

244
00:32:45,229 --> 00:32:48,665
I live very far from here

245
00:32:48,766 --> 00:32:51,326
It's an arduous journey back

246
00:32:51,436 --> 00:32:54,337
If he doesn't take me along

247
00:32:54,439 --> 00:32:56,771
I'm afraid I'll have to...

248
00:32:56,874 --> 00:32:59,502
Please don't cry

249
00:33:05,950 --> 00:33:09,716
Stop crying. I'll talk to him

250
00:33:11,789 --> 00:33:13,450
Young man

251
00:33:13,558 --> 00:33:18,052
She's a poor girl; she's all alone

252
00:33:18,162 --> 00:33:19,686
Please promise her

253
00:33:20,698 --> 00:33:24,464
Mister, all men aspire to
start a family and a career

254
00:33:24,569 --> 00:33:26,332
But as for my background

255
00:33:26,437 --> 00:33:28,462
You should understand why I'm doing this

256
00:33:29,107 --> 00:33:32,270
I um... better take your leave

257
00:33:48,126 --> 00:33:49,218
Yes

258
00:34:22,627 --> 00:34:28,122
Young man, please don't be so aloof

259
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:33,101
If you insist for me to marry her...

260
00:34:33,204 --> 00:34:34,933
Then it'd be on one condition

261
00:34:35,039 --> 00:34:36,836
What condition?

262
00:34:38,776 --> 00:34:41,609
I'll need a matchmaker
and a wedding witness

263
00:34:46,951 --> 00:34:50,409
At such an old age as I am...

264
00:34:50,521 --> 00:34:53,046
Would it be alright for me
to be a witness?

265
00:34:54,492 --> 00:34:56,460
You are aged,
of a high family and virtuous

266
00:34:56,561 --> 00:34:58,586
We're lucky to have you as our witness

267
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:03,090
But the witness can't be the matchmaker

268
00:35:03,201 --> 00:35:05,328
The matchmaker can't be the witness

269
00:35:06,170 --> 00:35:08,001
In that case

270
00:35:08,473 --> 00:35:09,735
What should we do?

271
00:35:13,778 --> 00:35:18,579
Mister, there's an Ash tree here

272
00:35:18,683 --> 00:35:20,878
It can be the matchmaker

273
00:35:20,985 --> 00:35:24,512
What? The tree as the matchmaker?

274
00:35:26,991 --> 00:35:29,016
How can it be an intermediary?

275
00:35:29,127 --> 00:35:31,618
Why not?

276
00:35:31,729 --> 00:35:33,754
It can't talk

277
00:35:34,065 --> 00:35:36,693
What if it can?

278
00:35:37,568 --> 00:35:39,502
If it talks...

279
00:35:39,604 --> 00:35:41,970
Then we'll get married

280
00:35:42,273 --> 00:35:45,071
What if it can't?

281
00:35:45,176 --> 00:35:47,007
Then let's end all this right here

282
00:35:47,111 --> 00:35:48,976
We'll go our separate ways

283
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:50,104
Really?

284
00:35:50,214 --> 00:35:55,015
Deal. But you must call for three times

285
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:56,108
All right

286
00:35:57,889 --> 00:36:00,221
Please be my witness, mister

287
00:36:00,324 --> 00:36:01,450
Sure

288
00:36:03,194 --> 00:36:06,823
Ash tree, I want to marry this lady

289
00:36:06,931 --> 00:36:11,368
Could you be our matchmaker? Please talk

290
00:36:13,004 --> 00:36:17,031
Has it talked?

291
00:36:21,979 --> 00:36:24,880
Second time

292
00:36:27,952 --> 00:36:31,353
Ash tree, I want to marry this lady

293
00:36:31,455 --> 00:36:34,891
Could you be our matchmaker? Please talk

294
00:36:37,562 --> 00:36:39,792
Not yet

295
00:36:39,897 --> 00:36:42,661
One more try

296
00:36:47,672 --> 00:36:50,197
Ash tree, I want to marry this lady

297
00:36:50,308 --> 00:36:53,072
Could you be our matchmaker? Please talk

298
00:36:53,177 --> 00:36:55,475
Please talk

299
00:37:15,399 --> 00:37:24,034
Tong Yong, hold on

300
00:37:24,141 --> 00:37:33,982
Hold on

301
00:37:34,085 --> 00:37:38,954
The Ash tree

302
00:37:39,056 --> 00:37:42,787
Opens its mouth and laughs

303
00:37:42,893 --> 00:37:47,728
I'll be your matchmaker

304
00:37:47,832 --> 00:37:56,331
I'll indeed be your matchmaker

305
00:37:57,575 --> 00:38:05,448
This is amazing

306
00:38:05,549 --> 00:38:10,384
Amazing!

307
00:38:10,488 --> 00:38:15,357
How could a tree talk?

308
00:38:15,459 --> 00:38:20,294
Is this destiny?

309
00:38:20,398 --> 00:38:22,992
It's a godsend match, don't hesitate

310
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:29,266
It's a divine match.
You shouldn't hesitate

311
00:38:29,373 --> 00:38:34,242
Although it's a match
predestined by Heavens

312
00:38:34,345 --> 00:38:39,214
But we should take this seriously

313
00:38:39,317 --> 00:38:45,745
The lady is nice to me

314
00:38:45,856 --> 00:38:51,522
But you shouldn't marry
a poor man like me

315
00:38:51,629 --> 00:38:57,534
I don't have a decent house

316
00:38:57,635 --> 00:39:02,299
I don't have worthy belongings

317
00:39:02,406 --> 00:39:07,742
If you marry me

318
00:39:07,845 --> 00:39:10,746
I worry that in the days to come

319
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:18,118
You'll starve and freeze because of me

320
00:39:19,390 --> 00:39:24,350
It's all right

321
00:39:24,462 --> 00:39:30,025
I know what I'm getting myself into

322
00:39:30,134 --> 00:39:35,731
We get married in adversities

323
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:40,903
For eternity

324
00:39:41,011 --> 00:39:45,311
My love for you won't change

325
00:39:45,416 --> 00:39:50,911
Come on, you two bow to heaven and earth

326
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:15,676
So you two get married under the Ash tree

327
00:40:20,718 --> 00:40:22,185
Congratulations

328
00:40:22,286 --> 00:40:27,053
I wish you both to have a happy marriage

329
00:40:27,158 --> 00:40:30,355
And have a child next year

330
00:40:30,861 --> 00:40:35,696
I'll ask for three cups of wine

331
00:40:39,570 --> 00:40:44,007
After the wedding ceremony,
the matchmaker can go

332
00:40:44,108 --> 00:40:47,942
It's time for me to move on

333
00:40:48,045 --> 00:40:49,740
Good bye

334
00:40:49,847 --> 00:40:50,814
Let us see you off

335
00:40:50,915 --> 00:40:53,349
There's no need to

336
00:40:53,451 --> 00:40:56,511
Me and my wife...

337
00:41:16,874 --> 00:41:19,365
Dear

338
00:41:19,477 --> 00:41:20,637
Dear husband

339
00:41:23,347 --> 00:41:25,212
Let's go

340
00:41:34,191 --> 00:41:34,987
Please

341
00:41:35,092 --> 00:41:36,525
After you

342
00:41:49,607 --> 00:41:54,010
A family of benevolence will be blessed

343
00:41:54,111 --> 00:41:57,308
Nicely written

344
00:41:59,950 --> 00:42:00,609
Zhaogui

345
00:42:00,718 --> 00:42:01,207
Yes master

346
00:42:01,318 --> 00:42:03,650
Send three silver coins over

347
00:42:03,754 --> 00:42:04,686
Yes master

348
00:42:04,788 --> 00:42:06,380
Wait...

349
00:42:06,490 --> 00:42:08,253
Send two coins

350
00:42:08,359 --> 00:42:09,519
Yes master

351
00:42:11,996 --> 00:42:13,520
Squire

352
00:42:17,968 --> 00:42:20,960
What? This doesn't count?

353
00:42:25,843 --> 00:42:28,835
There're seven of us in my family

354
00:42:28,946 --> 00:42:31,813
We live on the farm

355
00:42:32,082 --> 00:42:34,346
You... stop nagging

356
00:42:34,451 --> 00:42:36,385
It's written clearly on the debit-note

357
00:42:36,487 --> 00:42:39,012
If you fail to pay me back
by the due date...

358
00:42:39,123 --> 00:42:42,889
the farm will be mine. You signed this

359
00:42:42,993 --> 00:42:47,259
I'm going to pay you back

360
00:42:47,364 --> 00:42:50,060
I'm just asking for a few more days

361
00:42:50,167 --> 00:42:52,692
No, no exception

362
00:42:52,803 --> 00:42:56,068
If I do that,
everyone will be asking for extensions

363
00:42:56,173 --> 00:42:59,199
Please have pity on me

364
00:42:59,310 --> 00:43:01,471
Over the time I've paid a lot of interest

365
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:04,639
Are you inferring that I'm a loan-shark?

366
00:43:04,748 --> 00:43:07,683
No... I dare not say that

367
00:43:07,785 --> 00:43:09,719
That what did you mean?

368
00:43:09,820 --> 00:43:11,947
Zhaofu, throw him out

369
00:43:12,056 --> 00:43:12,579
Yes

370
00:43:12,690 --> 00:43:17,559
Squire...

371
00:43:18,596 --> 00:43:20,860
You're heartless

372
00:43:20,965 --> 00:43:23,297
I've borrowed five taels of silver

373
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:25,231
and I've already paid you half
of that as interest

374
00:43:25,336 --> 00:43:25,961
Get out...

375
00:43:26,070 --> 00:43:28,698
Damn it, throw him out

376
00:43:28,806 --> 00:43:33,140
Get out...

377
00:43:33,243 --> 00:43:34,870
You're wealthy but unkind

378
00:43:34,979 --> 00:43:36,844
You won't be so lucky forever

379
00:43:36,947 --> 00:43:38,380
Get out...

380
00:43:43,253 --> 00:43:44,618
Hey, come on

381
00:43:46,090 --> 00:43:49,150
Wait here, I'll speak to the master

382
00:43:49,593 --> 00:43:50,890
Go

383
00:43:59,303 --> 00:44:00,531
Come on

384
00:44:12,016 --> 00:44:13,984
Squire, Tong Yong is here

385
00:44:14,685 --> 00:44:16,812
Good day, squire

386
00:44:17,721 --> 00:44:19,655
Bring him to the mill

387
00:44:19,757 --> 00:44:21,122
Yes, master

388
00:44:22,092 --> 00:44:25,653
I also have...

389
00:44:26,130 --> 00:44:28,462
What?

390
00:44:28,565 --> 00:44:35,300
I have an umbrella outside

391
00:44:35,572 --> 00:44:37,005
Bring it

392
00:44:38,776 --> 00:44:40,676
Also...

393
00:44:40,778 --> 00:44:42,302
What?

394
00:44:43,647 --> 00:44:45,239
A sack

395
00:44:45,749 --> 00:44:47,216
Bring it

396
00:44:48,585 --> 00:44:50,951
Also...

397
00:44:51,055 --> 00:44:52,989
What else?

398
00:44:53,390 --> 00:44:55,915
What else?

399
00:44:56,026 --> 00:44:59,723
Also...

400
00:44:59,830 --> 00:45:01,229
And me

401
00:45:08,972 --> 00:45:10,633
Who's she?

402
00:45:12,042 --> 00:45:16,240
She's my wife

403
00:45:16,346 --> 00:45:18,109
She's your wife?

404
00:45:18,215 --> 00:45:21,343
The contract states that you are single

405
00:45:21,452 --> 00:45:23,682
And now you have a wife?

406
00:45:23,787 --> 00:45:27,314
Most likely it's kidnapping!

407
00:45:27,424 --> 00:45:30,154
We...

408
00:45:30,461 --> 00:45:33,624
I thought you are a filial son

409
00:45:33,731 --> 00:45:36,529
So you are a kidnapper

410
00:45:36,633 --> 00:45:37,565
Zhaogui

411
00:45:37,668 --> 00:45:38,657
Yes master

412
00:45:38,769 --> 00:45:40,327
Send them to the judge

413
00:45:40,437 --> 00:45:41,199
Yes, master

414
00:45:41,305 --> 00:45:42,272
Wait

415
00:45:42,372 --> 00:45:46,468
We have a witness to our marriage

416
00:45:46,577 --> 00:45:48,738
It's not kidnapping

417
00:45:48,846 --> 00:45:50,507
Do you know that on the contract...

418
00:45:50,614 --> 00:45:52,809
It has his name on it?

419
00:45:52,916 --> 00:45:54,679
He signed the contract before

420
00:45:54,785 --> 00:45:56,252
we got married

421
00:45:56,353 --> 00:45:58,253
Since we're married

422
00:45:58,355 --> 00:46:01,950
It's my duty to share my husband's work

423
00:46:02,059 --> 00:46:03,424
My husband sold himself as a slave here

424
00:46:03,527 --> 00:46:05,927
I can'tjust take off

425
00:46:06,029 --> 00:46:07,758
That's right, squire

426
00:46:07,865 --> 00:46:11,357
If I didn't bring her along with me...

427
00:46:11,468 --> 00:46:13,993
Then where could she go?

428
00:46:14,104 --> 00:46:17,267
You brought her along

429
00:46:17,374 --> 00:46:20,434
A woman can't do any work

430
00:46:20,544 --> 00:46:23,638
I can'tjust support her for free

431
00:46:26,583 --> 00:46:28,778
I can do other chores... like laundry

432
00:46:28,886 --> 00:46:30,683
I know how to weave

433
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,059
You know how to weave?

434
00:46:45,169 --> 00:46:46,193
Yes

435
00:46:48,572 --> 00:46:51,200
Don't ruin my good silk

436
00:46:57,681 --> 00:46:59,876
I'm not boasting

437
00:46:59,983 --> 00:47:03,419
I'm a good weaver, and efficient too

438
00:47:05,489 --> 00:47:07,923
You're very confident

439
00:47:15,465 --> 00:47:16,489
If you can weave quickly...

440
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:20,900
Can you finish
10 rolls of brocades overnight?

441
00:47:24,641 --> 00:47:26,040
What if I can?

442
00:47:26,143 --> 00:47:28,134
And what if I can't?

443
00:47:28,245 --> 00:47:31,146
It would be good if you can

444
00:47:31,248 --> 00:47:33,842
If you can't...

445
00:47:39,690 --> 00:47:46,186
then your husband will work here
for 6 years instead

446
00:47:47,464 --> 00:47:49,227
6 years?

447
00:47:52,836 --> 00:47:55,396
That's not fair

448
00:47:55,505 --> 00:47:58,133
If there's punishment,
there should be a reward

449
00:47:58,542 --> 00:48:01,807
If I finish on time...

450
00:48:01,912 --> 00:48:05,177
Then he'll work here for 100 days instead

451
00:48:05,282 --> 00:48:07,409
That's fair

452
00:48:11,121 --> 00:48:13,385
There's no point, dear

453
00:48:13,490 --> 00:48:15,890
You can't finish that much in ten nights

454
00:48:15,993 --> 00:48:18,655
...let alone in one night

455
00:48:18,762 --> 00:48:21,754
Don't worry, I know what I'm doing

456
00:48:22,733 --> 00:48:25,702
Do we have your word?

457
00:48:26,069 --> 00:48:27,934
Absolutely

458
00:48:28,038 --> 00:48:29,903
But if you can't finish it

459
00:48:30,007 --> 00:48:34,603
Then he'll work here for 6 years

460
00:48:34,711 --> 00:48:36,736
If I can finish it

461
00:48:36,847 --> 00:48:39,611
He'll work here for 100 days only

462
00:48:42,452 --> 00:48:43,817
Of course

463
00:48:43,921 --> 00:48:46,253
Take them to the weaving shed

464
00:48:46,356 --> 00:48:47,152
Yes master

465
00:48:49,826 --> 00:48:51,157
Follow me

466
00:49:04,441 --> 00:49:05,703
Zhaogui

467
00:49:06,476 --> 00:49:07,465
This way

468
00:49:07,577 --> 00:49:08,566
Sure

469
00:49:15,385 --> 00:49:16,613
Yes

470
00:49:26,563 --> 00:49:29,862
Look, dear.
All of it is tangled up and messy

471
00:49:34,338 --> 00:49:37,796
You can't finish weaving
ten rolls overnight

472
00:49:39,643 --> 00:49:43,170
We can't tell yet

473
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:46,044
But there's no point to be sad

474
00:49:46,149 --> 00:49:47,639
It won't help

475
00:49:49,419 --> 00:49:50,886
It doesn't matter to me

476
00:49:50,988 --> 00:49:54,151
3 years, 6 years, it's the same

477
00:49:54,257 --> 00:49:58,557
But I don't want you to be involved

478
00:49:58,662 --> 00:50:01,460
How can I calm down?

479
00:50:01,565 --> 00:50:04,796
I got myself into this

480
00:50:04,901 --> 00:50:06,732
If you don't blame me

481
00:50:06,837 --> 00:50:09,931
Then I'm willing to take the hardship

482
00:50:15,078 --> 00:50:17,569
You have no idea about the squire

483
00:50:20,550 --> 00:50:22,017
What about him?

484
00:50:23,387 --> 00:50:26,584
He's a miser... wealthy but unkind

485
00:50:32,529 --> 00:50:35,191
Dear, I think you should run away

486
00:50:35,298 --> 00:50:36,697
...now that no one's around

487
00:50:37,300 --> 00:50:38,733
Don't you want me anymore?

488
00:50:38,835 --> 00:50:40,826
I didn't mean that

489
00:50:42,706 --> 00:50:44,071
Not at all

490
00:50:45,042 --> 00:50:46,976
Then I'll stay

491
00:50:47,511 --> 00:50:49,706
I want to be with you

492
00:50:49,813 --> 00:50:54,546
For better or for worse

493
00:50:58,288 --> 00:51:01,780
Tong Yong...

494
00:51:02,225 --> 00:51:04,193
Go to work in the mill

495
00:51:04,294 --> 00:51:05,158
Yes

496
00:51:11,902 --> 00:51:12,891
Go

497
00:51:23,980 --> 00:51:29,475
I can't blame him for worrying

498
00:51:29,586 --> 00:51:37,789
He knows nothing that I'm a fairy

499
00:51:41,665 --> 00:51:49,003
Let me fix all this silk first

500
00:51:51,041 --> 00:52:02,817
I'm now at the mill and worrying

501
00:52:03,386 --> 00:52:10,588
I suggested you to leave;
you just won't listen

502
00:52:10,694 --> 00:52:21,229
We'll be slaving here for 6 years

503
00:52:22,139 --> 00:52:31,013
This is giving me a headache

504
00:52:34,417 --> 00:52:48,889
Then I heard the sound of the drum

505
00:52:49,466 --> 00:52:51,127
With just a pair of hands

506
00:52:51,234 --> 00:52:53,896
To finish weaving 10 rolls overnight

507
00:52:54,004 --> 00:52:56,165
It's difficult

508
00:53:00,844 --> 00:53:06,544
Remembering what my eldest sister told me

509
00:53:06,650 --> 00:53:15,490
Burn the incense stick when in trouble

510
00:53:18,161 --> 00:53:25,624
I hope they will be here soon

511
00:53:26,803 --> 00:53:37,907
The incense smoke raises up to the sky

512
00:53:38,014 --> 00:53:43,213
Our baby sister must be in trouble

513
00:53:43,320 --> 00:53:53,491
Let's go to take a look

514
00:54:11,348 --> 00:54:12,440
Eldest sister

515
00:54:12,549 --> 00:54:13,743
Seventh sister

516
00:54:13,850 --> 00:54:15,374
Second sister

517
00:54:16,253 --> 00:54:17,743
How have you been?

518
00:54:18,221 --> 00:54:19,745
Are you well?

519
00:54:19,856 --> 00:54:20,550
Fourth sister

520
00:54:20,657 --> 00:54:21,749
Where's our brother-in-law?

521
00:54:23,627 --> 00:54:27,859
Where's he? Let us see him...

522
00:54:27,964 --> 00:54:29,556
He's working in the mill

523
00:54:29,666 --> 00:54:32,134
What? This is your wedding night

524
00:54:32,235 --> 00:54:33,998
He should be here with you

525
00:54:34,104 --> 00:54:35,571
That's outrageous

526
00:54:35,672 --> 00:54:37,867
It's not his fault

527
00:54:37,974 --> 00:54:39,908
Him... who's he?

528
00:54:40,010 --> 00:54:42,672
Tell us who is he?

529
00:54:42,779 --> 00:54:44,406
Tell us

530
00:54:44,514 --> 00:54:45,742
Come on, seventh sister

531
00:54:45,849 --> 00:54:46,838
Seventh sister

532
00:54:46,950 --> 00:54:48,349
Who's he?

533
00:54:48,451 --> 00:54:51,420
Come on

534
00:54:52,389 --> 00:54:53,856
Eldest sister

535
00:54:53,957 --> 00:54:56,187
That's enough, everyone

536
00:54:56,293 --> 00:54:58,420
You summoned us here

537
00:54:58,528 --> 00:54:59,927
What's the matter?

538
00:55:00,030 --> 00:55:02,362
Eldest sister, the squire is mean

539
00:55:02,465 --> 00:55:04,023
He's doing this on purpose

540
00:55:04,134 --> 00:55:05,123
How?

541
00:55:05,235 --> 00:55:07,169
How has he troubled you?

542
00:55:07,270 --> 00:55:10,171
To weave ten rolls of brocade overnight

543
00:55:10,774 --> 00:55:11,741
That's a piece of cake

544
00:55:11,841 --> 00:55:15,072
With the seven of us

545
00:55:15,178 --> 00:55:18,670
We can finish thousands

546
00:55:18,782 --> 00:55:21,273
You just relax, let us all help you

547
00:55:21,384 --> 00:55:22,146
We will help you

548
00:55:22,252 --> 00:55:24,777
Okay... Let's begin

549
00:55:24,888 --> 00:55:26,082
Come on

550
00:55:35,398 --> 00:55:36,660
The shuttle of this loom is all broken

551
00:55:37,867 --> 00:55:39,164
It's broken

552
00:55:41,204 --> 00:55:43,900
He's terrible

553
00:55:44,007 --> 00:55:45,736
He makes sure you won't be able to finish

554
00:55:45,842 --> 00:55:47,673
What then?

555
00:55:47,777 --> 00:55:49,506
What now?

556
00:55:50,013 --> 00:55:51,981
Let me fly to the milky way

557
00:55:52,082 --> 00:55:54,448
and borrow the Weaving Fairy's shuttle

558
00:55:54,551 --> 00:55:55,950
That's right

559
00:55:58,588 --> 00:56:00,112
You don't need to go in person

560
00:56:00,223 --> 00:56:02,214
Send the crane

561
00:56:02,525 --> 00:56:04,186
Come with me

562
00:56:13,636 --> 00:56:14,398
Crane, where are you?

563
00:56:19,709 --> 00:56:23,702
Go to the Weaving Fairy

564
00:56:23,813 --> 00:56:25,542
...and borrow her shuttle

565
00:56:25,648 --> 00:56:26,876
Hurry back

566
00:56:42,632 --> 00:56:44,224
It's here

567
00:56:52,375 --> 00:56:54,104
Look, the shuttle is here

568
00:56:54,210 --> 00:56:56,371
Let's go

569
00:56:57,714 --> 00:57:03,050
Watchtower strikes two; the night is deep

570
00:57:03,153 --> 00:57:08,785
All the sisters are determined
to show their talents

571
00:57:08,892 --> 00:57:13,886
Weave brocades from the messy silk

572
00:57:13,997 --> 00:57:19,230
So that Tong Yong will work for 100 days

573
00:57:19,335 --> 00:57:22,634
100 days

574
00:57:26,242 --> 00:57:31,612
The stroke chimes again, it's 3 o' clock

575
00:57:31,714 --> 00:57:35,241
Indicating 3 o'clock

576
00:57:38,388 --> 00:57:43,724
The Weaving Fairy
has been touched by their plight

577
00:58:13,323 --> 00:58:18,852
If it weren't for the milky way

578
00:58:20,830 --> 00:58:24,163
The Weaving Fairy
would descend to earth again

579
00:58:24,267 --> 00:58:29,330
Descend to earth again

580
00:58:33,810 --> 00:58:36,108
The stroke chimes, the night is passing

581
00:58:36,212 --> 00:58:38,578
Weaving away

582
00:58:38,681 --> 00:58:41,650
The eldest sister weaves

583
00:58:44,020 --> 00:58:49,890
a pattern of unicorn sending a son

584
00:58:52,295 --> 00:58:56,095
The second sister weaves

585
00:58:56,199 --> 00:58:59,430
Evergreens

586
00:58:59,536 --> 00:59:04,496
A symbol for longevity

587
00:59:06,709 --> 00:59:08,973
Third and fourth sisters
weave extraordinary patterns

588
00:59:09,078 --> 00:59:13,071
Peonies and butterflies

589
00:59:15,318 --> 00:59:18,048
Fifth and sixth sisters decided

590
00:59:19,589 --> 00:59:21,819
to weave dots

591
00:59:21,925 --> 00:59:24,553
and patches

592
00:59:33,136 --> 00:59:36,367
They are actually clouds

593
00:59:36,472 --> 00:59:42,069
Spread all across the sky

594
00:59:45,415 --> 00:59:51,911
The seventh sister is in love

595
00:59:52,021 --> 01:00:03,899
She weaves a pair of mandarin ducks

596
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:05,763
So impressive

597
01:00:05,868 --> 01:00:08,632
Don't you agree?

598
01:00:12,775 --> 01:00:32,219
I think of my wife in the weaving room

599
01:00:38,401 --> 01:00:50,336
I worry that the sun will soon rise

600
01:00:51,914 --> 01:01:01,789
I can mill for thousand rounds

601
01:01:01,891 --> 01:01:17,000
But my dear wife,
how could you weave ten rolls?

602
01:01:21,744 --> 01:01:24,304
Guess, how many have we woven?

603
01:01:24,414 --> 01:01:26,211
How many, eldest sister?

604
01:01:26,716 --> 01:01:28,980
Ten rolls

605
01:01:29,085 --> 01:01:31,053
Three feet six inches extra

606
01:01:31,154 --> 01:01:33,179
Really? That's great

607
01:01:33,489 --> 01:01:35,423
For those that are extra

608
01:01:35,525 --> 01:01:37,322
We won't give it to the miser

609
01:01:37,427 --> 01:01:38,894
No way

610
01:01:46,202 --> 01:01:47,965
Let's leave that
for our future nephew's gown

611
01:01:48,071 --> 01:01:49,595
I don't want it

612
01:01:50,506 --> 01:01:52,201
Pass it to her

613
01:02:01,584 --> 01:02:02,551
Don't be shy

614
01:02:02,652 --> 01:02:04,711
Take it

615
01:02:04,821 --> 01:02:06,812
Don't be shy

616
01:02:06,923 --> 01:02:08,254
Take it

617
01:02:08,357 --> 01:02:10,484
Seventh sister, take it

618
01:02:22,371 --> 01:02:23,998
It's almost dawn

619
01:02:24,107 --> 01:02:27,565
It's time for us to leave

620
01:02:27,844 --> 01:02:31,473
We better head off

621
01:02:33,816 --> 01:02:36,944
Thank you for your help

622
01:02:37,286 --> 01:02:40,653
I appreciate it

623
01:02:40,823 --> 01:02:44,315
We're sisters,
we'll always help each other

624
01:02:45,194 --> 01:02:48,686
Take care, seventh sister

625
01:02:48,798 --> 01:02:53,861
Take care

626
01:02:55,071 --> 01:02:57,665
I can't see you off

627
01:03:03,513 --> 01:03:05,174
Hurry and leave

628
01:03:06,716 --> 01:03:09,685
Bye, seventh sister

629
01:03:09,852 --> 01:03:11,046
Bye

630
01:03:11,821 --> 01:03:16,315
We'll be seeing you again

631
01:03:19,061 --> 01:03:20,289
Take care

632
01:03:29,705 --> 01:03:31,036
Dear

633
01:03:33,876 --> 01:03:35,002
Dear husband

634
01:03:39,081 --> 01:03:44,383
Don't worry about the weaving

635
01:03:44,487 --> 01:03:46,751
Let's just accept life

636
01:03:48,224 --> 01:03:51,057
Six years will be over in a jiffy

637
01:03:52,061 --> 01:03:53,289
Come with me

638
01:03:53,863 --> 01:03:54,795
What is there to look?

639
01:03:54,897 --> 01:03:55,886
Come on

640
01:04:02,305 --> 01:04:04,603
Look

641
01:04:21,791 --> 01:04:23,782
Dear, these...

642
01:04:24,260 --> 01:04:26,455
Exactly what the Squire asked for

643
01:04:29,632 --> 01:04:33,432
The brocades all look great

644
01:04:33,536 --> 01:04:37,370
My wife is talented

645
01:04:37,473 --> 01:04:40,931
The butterflies are in pair

646
01:04:41,043 --> 01:04:44,945
So are the mandarin ducks

647
01:04:45,047 --> 01:04:46,776
My wife is indeed very dexterous

648
01:04:46,883 --> 01:04:48,646
My wife has refined craftsmanship

649
01:04:48,751 --> 01:04:53,586
Are you the weaving star?

650
01:04:53,689 --> 01:04:57,625
I'm not the weaving star

651
01:04:57,727 --> 01:05:01,424
I learnt under a good teacher

652
01:05:01,530 --> 01:05:03,225
I couldn't believe it

653
01:05:03,332 --> 01:05:05,129
But it's all done now

654
01:05:05,234 --> 01:05:10,570
Let's go to the Squire

655
01:05:10,673 --> 01:05:11,697
Excellent

656
01:05:11,807 --> 01:05:13,741
Tong Yong...

657
01:05:13,843 --> 01:05:15,071
Squire

658
01:05:15,177 --> 01:05:18,374
Here you go

659
01:05:19,916 --> 01:05:21,144
Please take a look

660
01:05:25,354 --> 01:05:28,790
You stole them?

661
01:05:29,292 --> 01:05:31,021
My wife weaved them

662
01:05:31,127 --> 01:05:32,617
How could you say that?

663
01:05:36,198 --> 01:05:38,598
How many wives have you got?

664
01:05:39,068 --> 01:05:40,035
One

665
01:05:40,136 --> 01:05:42,934
How many pairs of hands does she have?

666
01:05:43,039 --> 01:05:43,903
One

667
01:05:44,006 --> 01:05:45,234
Right

668
01:05:46,042 --> 01:05:47,942
One wife with her single pair of hands

669
01:05:48,044 --> 01:05:51,411
How could she do it?

670
01:05:51,514 --> 01:05:53,607
You stole these

671
01:05:53,716 --> 01:05:56,651
Squire, you say. Stolen from whom?

672
01:05:57,186 --> 01:06:00,485
Who's the owner? Got any proof?

673
01:06:01,457 --> 01:06:03,186
That...

674
01:06:03,292 --> 01:06:04,384
You're just disinclined to change...

675
01:06:04,493 --> 01:06:06,757
the three years contract into 100 days

676
01:06:06,862 --> 01:06:09,126
That's why you're doing this

677
01:06:10,967 --> 01:06:14,061
Man, I don't know
the background of your wife

678
01:06:14,170 --> 01:06:15,501
I'm going to the judge

679
01:06:15,604 --> 01:06:18,539
For you have kidnapped

680
01:06:21,444 --> 01:06:24,971
Let me tell you

681
01:06:25,081 --> 01:06:28,312
We had a matchmaker and a witness
for our wedding

682
01:06:28,417 --> 01:06:30,282
If you go to the judge

683
01:06:30,386 --> 01:06:32,354
And the matchmaker shows up

684
01:06:32,455 --> 01:06:34,946
You'll be charged with
making false accusations

685
01:06:35,458 --> 01:06:36,755
Then

686
01:06:36,859 --> 01:06:40,295
You'll be fined for at least 800 taels

687
01:07:04,320 --> 01:07:09,485
The contract is now changed to 100 days

688
01:07:09,592 --> 01:07:14,427
This fairy tale will be told
through the ages

689
01:07:14,530 --> 01:07:16,930
Through the ages

690
01:07:18,234 --> 01:07:25,072
They are so in love with each other

691
01:07:27,810 --> 01:07:35,182
Going home within 100 days

692
01:07:42,124 --> 01:07:50,054
The birds are in pairs

693
01:07:50,166 --> 01:07:57,868
The lush green hills are smiling

694
01:07:57,973 --> 01:08:05,709
There's no more menial work

695
01:08:05,815 --> 01:08:14,018
We can go home now

696
01:08:14,123 --> 01:08:21,552
You farm, and I'll weave

697
01:08:21,664 --> 01:08:29,537
I will carry the water, you irrigate

698
01:08:29,638 --> 01:08:37,272
Even a broken hut can give us shelter

699
01:08:37,379 --> 01:08:44,945
Our love can overcome all hardships

700
01:08:45,054 --> 01:08:51,323
We are like the mandarin ducks

701
01:08:51,427 --> 01:09:03,168
and living happily on earth

702
01:09:23,292 --> 01:09:25,419
We've been walking for a long time, dear

703
01:09:25,528 --> 01:09:27,393
Let's take a break

704
01:09:27,496 --> 01:09:28,485
Good idea

705
01:09:29,698 --> 01:09:30,687
Hey wait

706
01:09:40,442 --> 01:09:43,240
You should sit down too

707
01:09:43,345 --> 01:09:44,312
Sure

708
01:09:55,591 --> 01:09:58,822
Your gown is torn

709
01:09:58,928 --> 01:10:00,555
Let me mend it

710
01:10:27,856 --> 01:10:30,188
What's this, dear?

711
01:10:32,828 --> 01:10:35,820
Are you pregnant?

712
01:10:43,505 --> 01:10:45,405
Thank you, God

713
01:10:47,543 --> 01:10:49,306
Take care of yourself

714
01:10:49,411 --> 01:10:50,343
Let me go ahead

715
01:10:50,446 --> 01:10:52,311
and hire a sedan chair for you

716
01:10:54,383 --> 01:10:56,476
There's no need to waste money

717
01:10:56,585 --> 01:10:58,177
I'll be fine after a break

718
01:11:00,789 --> 01:11:03,257
Then I'll go get some water

719
01:11:04,693 --> 01:11:07,628
Hurry back

720
01:11:07,730 --> 01:11:09,254
I'll be back soon

721
01:11:19,541 --> 01:11:23,807
I'm pregnant now

722
01:11:23,912 --> 01:11:28,508
I'm just so thrilled about it

723
01:11:28,617 --> 01:11:30,608
When I give birth to my child

724
01:11:30,719 --> 01:11:32,812
I'm going to have a healthy happy child

725
01:11:32,921 --> 01:11:35,014
One big happy family

726
01:11:35,124 --> 01:11:41,654
Everyone says that I've good fortune

727
01:11:59,515 --> 01:12:02,040
Seventh princess, good day

728
01:12:02,151 --> 01:12:03,118
What are you doing here?

729
01:12:03,218 --> 01:12:04,708
The Jade Emperor has ordered that

730
01:12:04,820 --> 01:12:10,019
Your Highness must return by 12:45 p. M

731
01:12:11,593 --> 01:12:14,323
What are you talking about?

732
01:12:14,430 --> 01:12:17,695
The Jade Emperor has found out about this

733
01:12:17,800 --> 01:12:23,500
His Majesty is in a rage.
Please come with us

734
01:12:23,605 --> 01:12:26,631
I'm happily married

735
01:12:26,742 --> 01:12:29,040
I can'tjust leave like this

736
01:12:29,144 --> 01:12:31,112
If Your Highness refuses to come with us

737
01:12:31,213 --> 01:12:34,808
...then we'll have to capture you

738
01:12:36,118 --> 01:12:39,019
I'm not scared of anything

739
01:12:39,121 --> 01:12:40,713
Leave me alone

740
01:12:40,823 --> 01:12:46,784
I'll report this to the Jade Emperor

741
01:12:52,768 --> 01:13:06,910
My father ordered me to go back

742
01:13:07,015 --> 01:13:17,619
This is a disaster

743
01:13:18,227 --> 01:13:21,390
I'd rather be a mortal than a fairy

744
01:13:21,497 --> 01:13:24,625
I'm not going back

745
01:13:24,733 --> 01:13:28,100
Let me burn the incense stick

746
01:13:28,203 --> 01:13:36,440
Hoping that eldest sister
will come to my rescue

747
01:13:43,552 --> 01:13:45,179
Because she helped me before

748
01:13:45,287 --> 01:13:47,517
She's been locked up by our father

749
01:13:47,623 --> 01:13:50,319
She ordered the crane to send me a letter

750
01:13:50,426 --> 01:13:59,528
And told me to take this
into my own hands

751
01:14:08,644 --> 01:14:11,078
Seventh princess

752
01:14:17,319 --> 01:14:19,048
What are you doing here again?

753
01:14:19,154 --> 01:14:21,145
We've received a second order

754
01:14:21,256 --> 01:14:23,588
The Jade Emperor orders you to go back

755
01:14:23,692 --> 01:14:26,820
I won't go with you

756
01:14:26,929 --> 01:14:30,558
If that's the case, we will...

757
01:14:30,666 --> 01:14:31,963
What?

758
01:14:32,067 --> 01:14:34,661
We'll have to kill Tong Yong

759
01:14:34,770 --> 01:14:39,639
At 12:45 p. M
I'll await you at the South Gate

760
01:14:40,709 --> 01:14:45,009
My father has ordered twice

761
01:14:45,113 --> 01:14:53,452
It's like being stabbed in my heart

762
01:14:53,555 --> 01:14:56,023
I'm not afraid for myself

763
01:14:56,124 --> 01:15:01,187
But I don't want anything to happen
to my husband

764
01:15:01,296 --> 01:15:13,333
I'm caught in the middle

765
01:15:13,509 --> 01:15:14,874
Dear

766
01:15:16,645 --> 01:15:22,777
Dear

767
01:15:23,118 --> 01:15:39,433
How can I tell him the truth?

768
01:15:39,701 --> 01:15:40,895
Dear

769
01:15:44,306 --> 01:15:46,536
It was windy all of a sudden

770
01:15:46,642 --> 01:15:48,269
The whole sky turned dark

771
01:15:48,377 --> 01:15:50,641
Were you scared?

772
01:15:50,913 --> 01:15:55,179
I was hiding behind the tree

773
01:15:55,284 --> 01:15:57,115
I'm fine

774
01:15:58,287 --> 01:15:59,652
That's good

775
01:16:00,622 --> 01:16:02,681
I ran into a friend

776
01:16:02,791 --> 01:16:05,123
He gave me a pear and some dates

777
01:16:05,227 --> 01:16:07,525
Have some

778
01:16:08,397 --> 01:16:10,490
You go ahead

779
01:16:10,599 --> 01:16:13,659
I got those for you

780
01:16:16,805 --> 01:16:18,796
It's a bad omen

781
01:16:21,677 --> 01:16:23,008
Sorry?

782
01:16:24,446 --> 01:16:30,248
Pear and dates,
they signify 'we'll be split soon'

783
01:16:37,192 --> 01:16:39,422
There's another interpretation

784
01:16:39,528 --> 01:16:43,624
Having a child soon, and never apart

785
01:16:46,602 --> 01:16:48,194
Never apart?

786
01:16:48,303 --> 01:16:50,168
Never apart

787
01:16:52,741 --> 01:16:54,766
Look

788
01:16:54,876 --> 01:16:57,743
What are the kids doing?

789
01:17:00,949 --> 01:17:02,746
Flying a kite

790
01:17:04,386 --> 01:17:08,846
Why is the kite flying up?

791
01:17:11,460 --> 01:17:13,291
Coz its string is broken

792
01:17:14,730 --> 01:17:17,028
I have an analogy

793
01:17:17,132 --> 01:17:18,360
What kind?

794
01:17:18,900 --> 01:17:24,736
A blown off kite is like a wife
goes up to heaven

795
01:17:28,110 --> 01:17:29,941
Interesting

796
01:17:30,312 --> 01:17:32,678
Since we left the Fu Household

797
01:17:32,781 --> 01:17:34,908
We've been free

798
01:17:35,017 --> 01:17:38,817
Just as like going to heaven

799
01:17:45,694 --> 01:17:49,152
It's done. You can wear this now

800
01:18:11,019 --> 01:18:16,889
I have a wife to mend my clothes

801
01:18:16,992 --> 01:18:24,330
Much better than when I was single

802
01:18:24,433 --> 01:18:32,067
Now that we're going home

803
01:18:32,174 --> 01:18:38,841
Everyone will be impressed with my wife

804
01:18:39,848 --> 01:18:41,611
Let's go, dear

805
01:18:47,556 --> 01:18:49,547
Please

806
01:18:55,497 --> 01:19:21,552
My husband is walking fast leading ahead

807
01:19:21,623 --> 01:19:42,432
I'm crying behind

808
01:19:43,645 --> 01:19:55,682
He's so delighted

809
01:19:55,791 --> 01:20:09,103
and knows nothing of my worries

810
01:20:09,204 --> 01:20:32,551
He has a wife to mend his clothes

811
01:20:36,631 --> 01:20:51,069
But who would have thought that

812
01:20:51,179 --> 01:21:03,216
...the wife is about to leave him!

813
01:21:03,325 --> 01:21:12,859
I can only hate my father

814
01:21:12,968 --> 01:21:24,573
for not letting us to stay as a couple

815
01:21:27,415 --> 01:21:33,376
There's no place like home

816
01:21:33,488 --> 01:21:40,951
Tong Yong's heading home today

817
01:21:41,062 --> 01:21:49,231
I was single before

818
01:21:49,337 --> 01:21:55,537
Now I'm married

819
01:21:55,644 --> 01:21:58,374
We're going home together

820
01:21:58,480 --> 01:22:06,512
And we'll never be separated

821
01:22:09,824 --> 01:22:15,456
I see the ash tree again

822
01:22:15,563 --> 01:22:21,798
I'm so delighted

823
01:22:21,903 --> 01:22:26,738
We owe it to you

824
01:22:26,841 --> 01:22:34,976
...for being our matchmaker

825
01:22:36,551 --> 01:22:39,543
Dear, you should pay your respects

826
01:22:39,654 --> 01:22:45,957
I'm pregnant, I can't bow

827
01:22:47,829 --> 01:22:49,194
Right

828
01:22:51,232 --> 01:22:53,723
Have a seat

829
01:23:00,842 --> 01:23:02,776
I remember one thing

830
01:23:02,877 --> 01:23:03,935
When we got married

831
01:23:04,045 --> 01:23:05,842
Our witness said that

832
01:23:05,947 --> 01:23:07,915
If we'd have a baby next year

833
01:23:08,016 --> 01:23:09,847
Then he'd have three cups of wine

834
01:23:09,951 --> 01:23:11,441
Do you remember?

835
01:23:12,087 --> 01:23:13,577
Yes

836
01:23:13,688 --> 01:23:15,155
Although we are poor

837
01:23:15,256 --> 01:23:17,019
But as for the three cups of wine

838
01:23:17,125 --> 01:23:19,616
We must treat the old Sir

839
01:23:22,197 --> 01:23:24,062
Tong...

840
01:23:36,044 --> 01:23:39,309
It's almost noon. Let's go, dear

841
01:23:41,082 --> 01:23:44,074
It's almost noon?

842
01:23:56,998 --> 01:24:00,263
You're sweating

843
01:24:00,368 --> 01:24:01,835
Take this fan

844
01:24:03,138 --> 01:24:04,605
Thank you, dear

845
01:24:18,820 --> 01:24:21,880
There're a few lines of 'sayings'
written on it

846
01:24:21,990 --> 01:24:23,719
Have you read those?

847
01:24:24,259 --> 01:24:25,453
Writings

848
01:24:28,196 --> 01:24:32,633
Meeting a fairy underneath the Ash tree

849
01:24:38,373 --> 01:24:41,536
A loving couple

850
01:24:41,643 --> 01:24:45,272
hoping to spend
the rest of their lives together

851
01:24:45,380 --> 01:24:50,374
Yet the mandarin ducks will be split

852
01:24:53,588 --> 01:24:57,251
Do you get it?

853
01:24:57,358 --> 01:24:58,985
Lts meaning...

854
01:25:02,597 --> 01:25:04,064
No, I don't

855
01:25:07,602 --> 01:25:13,871
Look, a pair of mandarin ducks

856
01:25:19,614 --> 01:25:22,640
One's crying,
the other is about to take off

857
01:25:22,750 --> 01:25:25,310
Dear, why does it have to be so?

858
01:25:26,221 --> 01:25:28,951
They were a loving couple

859
01:25:29,057 --> 01:25:32,584
The female is about to fly

860
01:25:32,694 --> 01:25:35,663
The male is left crying

861
01:25:38,833 --> 01:25:39,857
I don't believe it

862
01:25:39,968 --> 01:25:42,493
I'll show you

863
01:25:45,373 --> 01:25:48,240
Female mandarin duck...

864
01:25:48,343 --> 01:25:51,176
Today is your day to fly

865
01:25:51,279 --> 01:25:54,043
Why don't you just fly?

866
01:25:58,753 --> 01:26:02,621
I can get the male mandarin duck
to fly too

867
01:26:02,924 --> 01:26:04,255
Male mandarin duck...

868
01:26:04,359 --> 01:26:06,657
Why don't you go with her?

869
01:26:07,295 --> 01:26:09,354
You fly off...

870
01:26:09,464 --> 01:26:11,864
Go ahead

871
01:26:12,700 --> 01:26:15,794
Why won't he listen?

872
01:26:16,237 --> 01:26:19,570
The female one is a celestial bird

873
01:26:19,674 --> 01:26:22,768
That's why she can fly to heaven

874
01:26:22,877 --> 01:26:26,369
The male one is but a mortal

875
01:26:26,481 --> 01:26:29,507
That's why he can't fly

876
01:26:32,954 --> 01:26:35,616
Dear

877
01:26:35,723 --> 01:26:37,623
How come you're acting strange today?

878
01:26:37,725 --> 01:26:39,920
If they are a loving couple

879
01:26:40,028 --> 01:26:42,997
Then they shouldn't be split up

880
01:26:44,098 --> 01:26:47,590
Please don't blame me

881
01:26:47,702 --> 01:26:53,334
You know we're like the mandarin ducks

882
01:26:55,243 --> 01:26:57,438
Meeting a fairy underneath the ash tree

883
01:26:57,545 --> 01:26:59,843
Are you a fairy?

884
01:26:59,948 --> 01:27:02,382
Dear, let me tell you the truth

885
01:27:02,483 --> 01:27:05,145
I'm the seventh daughter
of the Jade Emperor

886
01:27:05,253 --> 01:27:08,518
I descended down to earth to marry you

887
01:27:08,623 --> 01:27:12,218
Now my father has found out

888
01:27:12,327 --> 01:27:17,287
He's ordered me to go back
by 12:45 p. M today

889
01:27:18,132 --> 01:27:26,369
It's such a shock

890
01:27:26,474 --> 01:27:36,440
Being separated from my wife

891
01:27:36,551 --> 01:27:41,147
A mortal and a fairy?

892
01:27:41,256 --> 01:27:45,454
Since she's married to me

893
01:27:45,560 --> 01:27:52,056
She shouldn't leave me

894
01:27:52,166 --> 01:27:54,430
I must look for our witness

895
01:27:55,937 --> 01:27:57,165
Do you know who he is?

896
01:27:57,272 --> 01:27:58,034
No

897
01:27:58,139 --> 01:28:00,437
He's the local earth-god

898
01:28:00,908 --> 01:28:03,240
The local earth God

899
01:28:07,882 --> 01:28:11,978
Earth god

900
01:28:12,086 --> 01:28:16,580
Since you're our witness

901
01:28:16,691 --> 01:28:21,424
Now that she has to leave

902
01:28:21,529 --> 01:28:32,929
Why don't you show your powers?

903
01:28:40,281 --> 01:28:42,511
When we got married

904
01:28:42,617 --> 01:28:43,584
The ash tree was our matchmaker

905
01:28:43,685 --> 01:28:45,448
We must go ask the tree

906
01:28:45,553 --> 01:28:47,282
It's useless

907
01:28:47,388 --> 01:28:49,549
Please, I insist

908
01:28:51,459 --> 01:28:54,587
Ash tree, when we got married

909
01:28:54,696 --> 01:28:56,527
You opened your mouth

910
01:28:56,631 --> 01:28:58,155
Now that she's leaving

911
01:28:58,266 --> 01:29:00,461
Why don't you make her stay?

912
01:29:00,568 --> 01:29:03,503
Please speak

913
01:29:03,604 --> 01:29:06,767
Please

914
01:29:08,476 --> 01:29:12,810
Dear, it's just a piece of dumb wood

915
01:29:17,485 --> 01:29:26,883
Hey dumb wood, dumb wood

916
01:29:26,994 --> 01:29:36,392
Why don't you open your mouth now?

917
01:29:41,676 --> 01:29:47,945
You were our matchmaker

918
01:29:48,049 --> 01:30:00,917
and today... Why?

919
01:30:10,004 --> 01:30:21,745
Why can't I make my wife stay?

920
01:30:21,849 --> 01:30:42,863
The loving couple can't be separated

921
01:30:43,137 --> 01:30:53,877
Please don't leave me

922
01:30:53,981 --> 01:31:06,519
My dear

923
01:31:06,627 --> 01:31:11,223
It's almost 12:45 p. M now

924
01:31:11,332 --> 01:31:20,900
I won't let go

925
01:31:22,777 --> 01:31:25,302
This is the Jade Emperor's order

926
01:31:25,413 --> 01:31:30,874
It's 12:45 p.m.
Your Highness please come with us

927
01:31:30,985 --> 01:31:33,419
No, I won't let her go

928
01:31:33,521 --> 01:31:39,619
Or we'll have Tong Yong torn into pieces

929
01:32:07,154 --> 01:32:09,748
My dear

930
01:32:10,858 --> 01:32:11,415
My dear

931
01:32:11,526 --> 01:32:12,686
Dear husband

932
01:32:15,463 --> 01:32:17,090
My dear wife

933
01:32:19,534 --> 01:32:22,628
Stop it, please don't hurt him

934
01:32:22,737 --> 01:32:24,602
Please don't hurt him

935
01:32:24,705 --> 01:32:27,037
I'll go with you

936
01:32:27,141 --> 01:32:30,542
Just let me have a moment with him

937
01:32:30,645 --> 01:32:34,046
All right, generals

938
01:32:34,148 --> 01:32:35,046
Yes

939
01:32:35,149 --> 01:32:37,674
Let's go

940
01:32:37,785 --> 01:32:39,548
Yes

941
01:32:50,298 --> 01:33:03,405
My husband is lying in a coma

942
01:33:03,511 --> 01:33:27,267
I can do nothing but cry

943
01:33:31,639 --> 01:33:39,273
We are a loving couple

944
01:33:39,380 --> 01:33:54,990
I don't want you to get hurt

945
01:33:55,096 --> 01:34:06,098
Look what they've done

946
01:34:07,842 --> 01:34:13,644
If I don't go back

947
01:34:13,748 --> 01:34:19,015
You'll be killed

948
01:34:20,688 --> 01:34:23,953
Let me write down a note on the tree

949
01:34:24,058 --> 01:34:27,892
So that you can read it when you wake up

950
01:34:27,995 --> 01:34:31,726
Next spring

951
01:34:31,832 --> 01:34:41,434
Underneath the Ash tree

952
01:34:41,542 --> 01:34:52,976
My dear husband

953
01:34:53,087 --> 01:35:03,327
I'll deliver my son to you

954
01:35:03,431 --> 01:35:06,423
I'll be bound by no rules whatsoever

955
01:35:06,534 --> 01:35:15,772
Although we can't be together

956
01:35:15,876 --> 01:35:26,047
But we'll love each other forever

957
01:35:42,236 --> 01:35:53,306
My dear...

958
01:35:53,414 --> 01:36:07,090
Next spring

959
01:36:07,194 --> 01:36:14,896
Underneath the tree

960
01:36:15,002 --> 01:36:22,499
My dear husband

961
01:36:22,610 --> 01:36:25,443
I'll deliver my son to you

962
01:36:25,546 --> 01:36:29,778
No rules are going to stop me

963
01:36:29,884 --> 01:36:40,055
Although we can't be together
