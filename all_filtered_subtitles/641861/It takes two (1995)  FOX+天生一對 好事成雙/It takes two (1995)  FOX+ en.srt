1
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:53,200
<i>-Come on, Mandy, you can do it!</i>
<i>-Hit a homer!</i>

2
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:55,760
<i>Easy now!</i>

3
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,720
<i>Come on, back up, back up!</i>

4
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,320
Back up, back up!

5
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:03,240
Well, fans, it's the bottom of
the ninth and bases are loaded.

6
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,600
And guess who
the orphans have at bat?

7
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:08,360
That's right,
it's the homerun queen herself,

8
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,200
the belter from the shelter,

9
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:12,320
-Miss Amanda...
-Amanda Lemmon!

10
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,880
-What?
-I'm gonna kill you!

11
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:17,400
Didn't I tell you not to
play ball in that dress?

12
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:20,600
Oh, come on, Diane,
I ain't gonna hurt it.

13
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,560
It's time for your interview.
Now drop the bat, let's go!

14
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:27,200
Just let me smash
this ball downtown, okay?

15
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,240
All right, you got 10 seconds.

16
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:33,400
Otherwise, the game is gonna be
called on account of bloodshed.

17
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,040
Come on, Frankie,
I gotta go to Staten Island.

18
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:40,680
Staten Island? What about camp?
You'll miss the bus!

19
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,720
I won't either.
It's just a look-see.

20
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:45,520
They're not trying to place you
with the Butkis' are they?

21
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,560
So what if they are?

22
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,520
You ever met those people?

23
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:52,680
That family collects kids.
They'll take anybody.

24
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,640
Even the rejects like you.

25
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:57,640
Shut up, Frankie.
At least I got an interview.

26
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:01,280
And Amanda Butkis
steps to the plate.

27
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,520
Come on, Amanda!

28
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:10,320
Hit me in!

29
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:25,320
Come on, relay, relay!

30
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:40,400
Over here!

31
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:56,040
-Come on, come on. Hop in.
-Man, it was a grand slam.

32
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,880
Hey, Diane, see if they
want a little boy.

33
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,880
You know, me and her,
two-for-one?

34
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:02,640
What am I, on sale? Get your own.

35
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,600
Staten Island, please.

36
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,480
You're out! We win!

37
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:14,600
Amanda never touched home base!
Yeah!

38
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:17,520
You're a dead man, Frankie!

39
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,240
-Here you go.
-Thanks.

40
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,960
Okay, so, you know,
it's not exactly Park Avenue,

41
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
but you can't always judge a book
by the cover.

42
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:39,880
Besides, you don't wanna be
an orphan forever.

43
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:41,840
So adopt me, why don't ya?

44
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:43,520
They won't let me adopt you
on my salary.

45
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:44,760
Besides that, you know what?

46
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,720
You deserve a mother
and a father.

47
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:47,960
So get a husband.

48
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:50,360
It's not like buying
a car, you know.

49
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:53,880
I know. It's gotta be that
can't-eat, can't-sleep,

50
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:56,160
reach-for-the-stars,
over-the-fence,

51
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:58,320
World Series kind of stuff.
Right?

52
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:00,400
Well, a girl's gotta
have her standards.

53
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:02,200
Well, I got mine and I say...

54
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:04,160
...let's blow off these people.

55
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:09,400
Gum. Hat.

56
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,120
Other gum.

57
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:18,720
Now look, I know
these people have a stupid name.

58
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,840
But they really like kids, okay?

59
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,000
Put on a smile.

60
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,080
Sell it, girl.

61
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:29,040
Why do I always
gotta wear a dress?

62
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:32,040
Because it makes you
look so pretty.

63
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:43,640
Oh, isn't she the most
precious thing?

64
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:48,000
-What a pretty little dress.
-She's a honey alright.

65
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:50,720
Look at that, Fanny,
she's got your mother's smile.

66
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:54,520
And your father's sense of humor.

67
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:58,400
-I'm sorry.
-That was very funny.

68
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:01,280
-Come on in.
-Come on, sweetie.

69
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:38,000
-Callaway, huh?
-Yeah.

70
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,520
Must be a real bigshot.

71
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,600
Oh, you'd be surprised how big.

72
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:48,800
All this for her?

73
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,120
Geez.

74
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,640
Welcome home, princess.

75
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,080
He forgot again, didn't he?

76
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,640
Oh, well, I'm afraid
your father's

77
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:08,720
been unavoidably detained.

78
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
But if it's any consolation,
I know an old butler

79
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,440
who's mighty glad to see you.

80
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:18,560
Oh, I'm sorry, Vincenzo.
How terribly rude of me.

81
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,240
I'm very glad to see you too.

82
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,120
Thank you, honey.

83
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,440
Hey, I see you've
been practicing.

84
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,760
Congratulations.

85
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:28,040
-What's the excuse this time?
-Your father?

86
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:29,400
Well, he's, uh...

87
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,600
He's preparing for your arrival
up at the summer house.

88
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,840
-Which one?
-On Lake Minocqua.

89
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,320
But that's been closed for years.

90
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:40,200
-He never goes up there.
-Well, he does now.

91
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,640
Oh, Vincenzo, you big fat fibber.

92
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:45,640
-What's going on?
-My lips are sealed.

93
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:48,400
You mean it's a surprise?

94
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:51,200
Oh, yeah, I suppose
you could put it that way.

95
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:53,120
It's a welcome home party for me!

96
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:55,600
Isn't it?
I knew Daddy was up to something.

97
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:56,960
Oh, well, now, Alyssa,
I didn't say...

98
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,040
Oh, Vincenzo, I won't tell.

99
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:01,720
I've never had a surprise party
my whole life.

100
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,200
Well, this will certainly
be a surprise.

101
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,960
Come on, come on, come on,
come on, move it!

102
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:16,120
-I've got 43.
-Me too.

103
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,200
-Guess who's missing?
-Oh, come...

104
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:19,920
-Where's Amanda?
-She's not coming.

105
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:21,800
I'm gonna kill her.

106
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:27,200
Hey, slugger, s'up?

107
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:29,640
I'm not going to stupid camp.

108
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,000
Oh, yeah, I don't blame you.

109
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:34,680
Look at this place,
it's a pigsty.

110
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:37,440
Probably gonna take you the whole
week just to make your bed.

111
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:39,400
Don't joke, I'm serious.

112
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,720
I'm not joking.

113
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:44,120
That's why I sent the bus ahead
without us.

114
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,440
-Liar.
-Oh, yeah?

115
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,560
How much you wanna bet?

116
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,480
-50 bucks.
-Okay, so I didn't send the bus.

117
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,360
Cough it up.

118
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:53,000
But I will.

119
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:55,200
And then you and I
can just sit here

120
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:57,080
until you tell me
what's really wrong.

121
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,800
I'm not going to
stupid Butkis' either.

122
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:03,560
I was waiting for that one.

123
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,120
If they're the best I can do,
Frankie's right.

124
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,640
I am a reject.

125
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,520
You're not a reject.

126
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:17,560
It's just that most
people wanna adopt...

127
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,800
Babies. I know.

128
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:23,640
This orphan stuff is like
growing up in the dog pound.

129
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,600
Everybody wants a puppy.

130
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:28,400
Just once I'd like to
sleep in my own room.

131
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:31,320
Hey, come here a minute.

132
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,800
Listen to me.
You listening to me?

133
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:39,520
I'm gonna find you the best home
in the entire world.

134
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,160
That's a promise.

135
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:46,360
You don't make
promises, remember?

136
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:48,400
I didn't say I don't
make promises.

137
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:51,160
I said I don't make promises
I can't keep.

138
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,800
There's a big difference.

139
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:58,560
Now... Can we please go to camp?

140
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:00,320
Please?

141
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,320
-Please, please, please...
-Okay, okay, okay!

142
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:03,840
Okay, okay, okay!

143
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,360
But you still owe me 50 bucks.

144
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:03,320
Oh, Vincenzo, it's gorgeous!

145
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,680
I think this house is going to be
my favorite.

146
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,960
Yeah, I remember
many happy years here.

147
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:12,400
-Hey! There she is!
-Oh, Daddy!

148
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:15,040
Come over here! My little...

149
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:18,160
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

150
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:20,320
You're not Alyssa Callaway.
Alyssa Callaway's a little girl

151
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:21,720
and you're a foot
taller than she is.

152
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,920
-It's me, honest.
-It is?

153
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,520
Honey, I've missed you so much.

154
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:29,200
I'm sorry I wasn't at the airport
to meet you.

155
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:33,040
That's okay. I knew it had to be
something really important.

156
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:35,480
Like... A party, maybe?

157
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:39,240
-She knows about the party?
-I didn't say a thing.

158
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:43,640
Vincenzo didn't tell me.
I figured it out on my own.

159
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:46,800
I should've let you surprise me,
but I'm too excited.

160
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:48,360
You are?

161
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,680
It's still on, isn't it?

162
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,640
Yes, of course it's
still on, sweetheart, but...

163
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,080
are we talking about
the same party?

164
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:59,440
Oh, Roger! She's darling!

165
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:01,840
Alyssa, I would like you to meet
a very good friend of mine,

166
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:03,160
Clarice Kensington.

167
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,640
Hello, Miss Kensington,
how do you do?

168
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:10,040
What a perfect little girl.

169
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:13,240
Roger, I'm absolutely smitten!

170
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,640
You and I are going
to be great friends.

171
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,080
Are you here for my party?

172
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,200
Your party?

173
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:25,920
Roger, don't tell me
you haven't told her.

174
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,240
Told me what?

175
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:32,600
Sweetheart,
the party is not for...

176
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:35,200
Another couple of hours.

177
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:37,720
So, let's get you
settled in there, princess.

178
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,760
Yes, why don't you do that.

179
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:43,280
I'm sure you two have
lots to talk about.

180
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,840
He didn't tell her, I can't
believe he didn't tell her.

181
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:50,280
Maybe he wanted to
give her the good news in person.

182
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:54,160
I'm sorry,
did I say something to you?

183
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:17,160
Remember to bring your own bag.
Everybody off!

184
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:30,320
Yo, Carmen, you blind?

185
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,200
What?

186
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:37,440
Girl, when you gonna get a life?

187
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,680
Miss Kensington seems nice.

188
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:47,160
Does she work with you?

189
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:51,440
Not exactly.

190
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:56,280
Hey, I got something to show you.

191
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:57,640
Right up here.

192
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:01,280
You see there, across the lake?

193
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:02,720
That's Camp Callaway.

194
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:04,400
That was your mom's
favorite project.

195
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:07,080
So, is she from the camp?

196
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:08,280
Who?

197
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:09,880
Miss Kensington.

198
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:15,040
Uh, sweetheart, I gotta have
a little talk with you.

199
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:20,400
You know, Alyssa,

200
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:22,560
a lot's happened
while you were gone.

201
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:26,680
And you know I haven't been
able to come up to this house

202
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,080
since Mom passed away.

203
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:32,800
But there comes a time
when a person has to move on.

204
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:35,240
You're getting older and...

205
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:38,920
...and there's just so much
a father can do without help.

206
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:42,240
-We have Vincenzo, he helps us.
-That's right, he does.

207
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:43,800
And he's been
a good friend to this family

208
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:45,240
for a long time, but...

209
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:49,600
...what I think
our family really needs is a...

210
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:50,960
Excuse me.

211
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,440
Telephone, boss,
it's a board meeting.

212
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:53,720
Oh, let me,
let me call them back...

213
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:54,800
They said it was urgent.

214
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:56,240
I'm with my...

215
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:02,600
-Will you forgive me?
-Don't I always?

216
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:06,320
It's so good to have you home.

217
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:11,200
-It's on two? Okay.
-Yeah.

218
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:14,120
Hey, young lady.

219
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,960
Summer vacation, official.
Go play.

220
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,200
-Will you come with me?
-Oh, gee,

221
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:21,520
I wish I could, princess.

222
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:23,760
But I'm afraid
I got a lot of work to do, sorry.

223
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:40,800
Wow. Check it out!
Buckingham Palace!

224
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:44,800
That's in London, brainless.
It's the Callaway house.

225
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,960
Nobody's lived there for years.
It's haunted.

226
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,440
-It's not either.
-Ask anyone.

227
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,520
Every full moon,
old lady Callaway's ghost

228
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,760
crosses the lake
and eats one of the campers.

229
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,640
Yeah, right,
and Santa Claus lives

230
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:58,880
with the Tooth Fairy in Queens.

231
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,840
-You ever been over there?
-No.

232
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,360
If you're so sure
it's not haunted,

233
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:04,240
why don't you go over there
and ring the doorbell?

234
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:07,560
-Think I'm scared?
-5 bucks says you're chicken.

235
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:10,600
Cough it up, choir boy.
Show me your money.

236
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:12,880
Oh, this I gotta see.

237
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:32,120
<i>I didn't even know they had</i>
<i>a caterer in the country.</i>

238
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,040
<i>Thank God.</i>

239
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:36,360
They say the first Mrs. Callaway

240
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:40,640
was a lovely woman,
but look at this room.

241
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:43,960
No wonder the woman's dead,
she had absolutely no taste.

242
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:46,040
I can't wait to sell this house.

243
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,640
Now, Jules,
I want one bar set up in here

244
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:50,080
and two out in the patio...

245
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,960
Well hello, munchkin.

246
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,080
Oh, boy.

247
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:08,600
Daddy!

248
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:11,440
Honey? Honey, what's the matter?

249
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,120
What?

250
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:15,240
What, what? You all right?

251
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:16,120
No!

252
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,880
What? What happened?

253
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:21,120
She... She hates this house!

254
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:25,000
Oh... Let's not be dramatic,
darling.

255
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:26,200
She was hiding in the den

256
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:28,880
and I simply said
that we might, um...

257
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,600
Fix it up some day.

258
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:33,000
That is if you'll let me.

259
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:34,920
Who is she?

260
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,480
I guess there's no
easy way to say this.

261
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:52,520
Sweetheart... Clarice and I...

262
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:55,840
-...will be married next month.
-Wha...

263
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:57,800
You're finally gonna
have a real family.

264
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,400
And she's gonna be
your new mother.

265
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,120
Isn't that wonderful?

266
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,240
She does this sometimes.

267
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:16,400
-Honey. Honey, honey...
-And she gets away with it.

268
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:20,640
I'm sorry, Roger, but little
tantrums mustn't be rewarded.

269
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:23,720
Alyssa... come on, sweetheart.

270
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,400
Roger, you're only
making it worse.

271
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,640
I know what I'm talking about.

272
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:32,200
All right, people, back to work.

273
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:35,920
Let's focus on
the engagement party.

274
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:37,280
Sure hope you're right.

275
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:42,520
Trust me, I'm a woman.

276
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:48,920
Oh, look at the time.
I've got to get my face on.

277
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:55,920
How's about some
milk and cookies, huh?

278
00:18:57,560 --> 00:19:00,360
I've lost my mother
and now I've lost my father.

279
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,880
I have no family. I'm an orphan.

280
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:06,640
And I'm running away
and don't you dare tell Daddy!

281
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:09,720
Come on, come on, we gotta hide.

282
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,640
-What if we get caught?
-Don't let her see ya.

283
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:13,400
-Who?
-Old lady Callaway.

284
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:14,320
There's no ghost.

285
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,040
Look at her.

286
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:19,640
She's nuts.

287
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:26,600
I won't go back.

288
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:28,240
I won't.

289
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,280
She's not the boss of me.

290
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,440
Vincenzo, have you seen Alyssa?

291
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:36,320
I'm under strict orders not to
tell you that she ran away.

292
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:38,320
Great, why didn't you stop her?

293
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:40,480
Well, I thought I'd give her
the benefit of a head start.

294
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:43,480
So she could reclaim
a little dignity, you know.

295
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:45,320
You'll make sure
she comes home okay?

296
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:48,000
Sure, don't worry.
Right away, boss.

297
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:49,080
Thanks, Vin.

298
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:53,760
It doesn't look haunted.

299
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,600
That's what
they want you to think, stupid.

300
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:59,200
Frankie, this isn't funny
anymore, let's get out of here.

301
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:00,640
Don't worry, she'll chicken out.

302
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,680
Go, go, go.

303
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:26,000
Well, if it isn't
a little orphan girl.

304
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:30,360
-Someone's home!
-We were just coming after you.

305
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:33,400
Look, I didn't mean nothing!
It was just a joke, you know?

306
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,880
Just kidding around, honest!

307
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:39,440
She didn't even scream.

308
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:42,560
Let's get you ready
for the big dinner, okay?

309
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:46,600
Big dinner? Listen, Lurch, you
don't want me, I'm too skinny.

310
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:49,760
There are other kids,
big fat ones, right outside.

311
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:50,640
Eat them.

312
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:54,440
What in the world
are you talking about?

313
00:20:59,040 --> 00:20:59,920
Hey, Frankie...

314
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:03,800
...the full moon,
that's tonight, right?

315
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,800
Old lady Callaway's ghost?

316
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:14,000
It's her!

317
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:22,440
Guess you think
I'm pretty stupid, huh?

318
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:25,120
Nah, you're just a little
upset, that's all.

319
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,400
Looks like I just won 5 bucks.

320
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:30,960
So, when's this party?
Am I invited?

321
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:34,400
Your dress is upstairs on the
bed, cocktails are at 5:00.

322
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:35,960
Now, if you'll excuse me, please.

323
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:39,160
A dress? Me?

324
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:41,160
You gotta be kidding.

325
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,560
Nobody's even looking for me.

326
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:52,000
There you are.

327
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:56,240
I have been looking
everywhere for you.

328
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:57,360
You have?

329
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:59,240
Well, of course I have.

330
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,360
Let me ask you a question.

331
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:04,400
You did not come
all the way up here

332
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:07,680
to sit around
like a bump on a log, did you?

333
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:09,200
No...

334
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:12,360
I... I guess not.

335
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:15,000
Well then, come on, slugger,
they're playing football.

336
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:17,040
You're missing out
on all the fun.

337
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:27,200
Okay.

338
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:33,440
I thought, "Where is she?
What's happened to her?"

339
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,200
So I hear Amanda's
quite the jock.

340
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:42,600
Yeah, the kid's a natural.
Great speed.

341
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:45,480
Okay, student body left.
Everybody block for Amanda.

342
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:47,240
-On four. Ready?
-Break!

343
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:50,240
-Who's Amanda?
-Funny.

344
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:44,600
She's probably eating her liver
right now.

345
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:46,680
Do you think one camper's enough?

346
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:49,200
I mean, what if
she's still hungry?

347
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:51,080
Look!

348
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:54,400
Twenty-four, thirty-six,
hut, hut, hut, hut!

349
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:58,080
-Hey, I got it!
-Run!

350
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:01,520
You're going the wrong way.

351
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,160
Great speed.

352
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,200
Bad sense of direction.

353
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:00,360
Do you see... What I see?

354
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:03,960
I don't know what you see,
but what I see is me.

355
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:05,320
I see me too.

356
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,640
Does that mean
there's two of you?

357
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:10,840
Or... Or two of me?

358
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:27,960
Wow, there really is two of us.

359
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:30,160
Don't you find this odd?

360
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:34,760
No, this is weird.
This is really, really weird.

361
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:36,480
Wait a sec.

362
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:39,000
You live at the Callaway house.

363
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:41,480
And you're that girl from camp.

364
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:43,720
-They thought I was you.
-They thought I was you.

365
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:46,440
Alyssa Callaway,
it's a pleasure to meet you.

366
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,600
Amanda, put her there.

367
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:51,920
No wonder that big penguin guy
asked me in.

368
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:54,520
Oh, that's Vincenzo,
he's our butler.

369
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,800
Who's the woman
with the dark, long hair?

370
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:58,000
I liked her.

371
00:25:58,040 --> 00:26:00,000
Oh, that's Diane. We're buds.

372
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:01,960
She's pretty cool for a grown-up.

373
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:05,720
What the heck
were you doing over there anyway?

374
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:09,440
I... I wanted to see
what it was like to be an orphan.

375
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,920
What? Why?

376
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:13,640
Because it looked like fun.

377
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:17,960
Fun being an orphan?
What's the matter with you?

378
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:19,960
So why were you at my house?

379
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:23,480
I was... Just...

380
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:25,560
I was just ringing the doorbell.

381
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:27,240
What for?

382
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,960
Because kids think
that place is haunted.

383
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:31,640
That's stupid.

384
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:34,520
Yeah? Well then,
who's that scary blond lady?

385
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:37,800
She's absolutely horrid.

386
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:39,960
If I were you,
I'd get rid of her.

387
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,080
-Any suggestions?
-You're talking to a pro here.

388
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:46,760
I've driven away more possible
parents than you'll ever meet.

389
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,680
Don't you want a family?

390
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:50,480
Girl's gotta have her standards.

391
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:55,640
So tell me something, this party.
You really don't wanna go?

392
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:57,400
I'd rather eat dirt.

393
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:58,640
Okay, so listen.

394
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:01,400
You be me, I'll be you.
One night only.

395
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:03,200
Tomorrow at noon, we switch back.

396
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:05,640
-What do you say?
-That's wonderful.

397
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:07,840
That way,
you can scare off Clarice for me.

398
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:09,800
Only, don't be such
a goody-goody.

399
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:12,200
You know, I got
a reputation to protect.

400
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:14,840
I scored a touchdown, didn't I?

401
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:18,640
Okay, just don't talk so good.
Use lousy English, like...

402
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:23,080
"Ain't ya never gonna wanna don't
ya have to go to the bathroom?"

403
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:24,200
That sort of thing.

404
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:27,960
You ain't got nothing
to worry about.

405
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:31,600
I say, you do catch
on rather quickly.

406
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:34,560
-Stables, noon.
-Yes.

407
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:01,840
Woo... Close!

408
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:05,760
Miss Kensington says "fashionably
late" was an hour ago.

409
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:07,400
What seems to be the problem?

410
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:11,040
I'm a hairdresser,
not a zookeeper.

411
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:21,040
What in the name of God
is going on here?

412
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:26,880
Hi, Vinny. I mean, Vincenzo.

413
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:29,480
I got... Distracted.

414
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:31,800
Uh, you don't have to apologize.

415
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:33,200
Really?

416
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:34,560
Cool.

417
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:36,960
I mean, it's just that

418
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:40,640
I'm so terribly relived
that you aren't pissed.

419
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:45,560
Pissed, miss?

420
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:48,800
Uh, look. Um, why don't you...

421
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:50,400
Why don't you get
dressed, please?

422
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:53,640
And let... Let Carlo do
your hair, all right?

423
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:55,960
I liked it better
when she fainted.

424
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:30,840
This is really good!

425
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:34,520
Well, of course it is, silly.
It's your favorite.

426
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:36,000
It is?

427
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:39,840
Oh, yes, of course. The, um...

428
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:44,440
Um... big, gooey, messy burger.

429
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:46,400
Also known as a Sloppy Joe.

430
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:48,520
Sloppy Joe, right.

431
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:50,880
Your favorite?

432
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:53,520
Yes, and with dern good reason.

433
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:56,720
Did you just say "dern"?

434
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:06,960
I haven't seen you in so long.

435
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:12,480
Hello. Good evening.

436
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:14,720
-Good evening.
-How swell of you to come.

437
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:16,880
-So nice to see you.
-Nice to see you.

438
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:19,200
-Like my dress?
-Very nice.

439
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:20,800
Escargot, Miss Callaway?

440
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:23,640
Why, thank you, waiter person.

441
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:28,280
I'm starving.
I mean, I'd adore one.

442
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:33,880
This tastes like a balloon.

443
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:36,160
It's snails, miss.

444
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:38,120
Good.

445
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:40,400
Nice.

446
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:42,160
Chewy.

447
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:50,920
All this money
and these people eat slugs?

448
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:58,240
Well, look who's finally decided
to grace us with her presence.

449
00:30:58,680 --> 00:30:59,840
Clarice, right?

450
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:02,000
You looked better with the mask.

451
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:03,400
I beg your pardon.

452
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:05,120
Alyssa.

453
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:07,400
Clarice has been regaling us with

454
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:09,840
your many accomplishments
at the Academy.

455
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:12,360
Might we entice you
to play something?

456
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:15,960
Of course, I'd be delighted.

457
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,080
Whatever did you have in mind?

458
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:20,720
Checkers, dodgeball?

459
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:27,320
No, no, dear girl.

460
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:30,080
Muffy was referring to the piano.

461
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:33,480
-But...
-Ladies and gentlemen,

462
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:35,480
may I have your attention,
please?

463
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:39,800
Before we sit down to dinner,
my future step-daughter,

464
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:43,160
whom I absolutely adore,

465
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:45,080
has consented to play
one of the pieces

466
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:48,800
that won her first prize at the
Windsor Academy Youth recital.

467
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:57,440
Hold it, time out.
I can't play the piano.

468
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,480
But I just told everyone
that you would.

469
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:02,240
Then do me a grand favor
and un-tell them.

470
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:03,200
Look, you little...

471
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:08,520
If you embarrass me
in front of all these people,

472
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:11,000
I'll make sure that
you never play anything...

473
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:14,840
...ever again.
Have I made myself clear?

474
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,240
Clear as glass.

475
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:21,240
In fact, I can see
right through you.

476
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:34,520
Ladies and gentlemen,

477
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:38,400
normally I'd be tickled
to play a selection from...

478
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:43,200
...Chopin. But in honor
of my new stepmother,

479
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:46,840
whom I absolutely adore...

480
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:50,520
I decided to play
a little something of my own.

481
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:17,080
You think maybe
my daughter's asking

482
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:18,120
for a little bit of attention?

483
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:20,200
I'd say she's demanding it.

484
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:24,240
A shark! Shark!

485
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:28,840
Fin! Huckleberry Finn!

486
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:30,520
Yeah, that's it! You got it!

487
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:40,280
Oh, man, the guys are ahead of us
by eight seconds.

488
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:42,680
Okay, Amanda, it's your turn.
You're up. Go, girl.

489
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:44,960
-Me?
-You're the best.

490
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,000
Show them what you got.

491
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:47,360
Come on.

492
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:49,200
Amanda!

493
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:02,880
Look at her, she's nervous.

494
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:04,160
Yeah, so?

495
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:06,280
I thought Amanda
wasn't scared of nothing.

496
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:12,720
What am I supposed to do?

497
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:19,720
Ready. Set. Go!

498
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:23,160
Song!

499
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:37,120
What? What happened?

500
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:38,880
London Bridge is Falling Down!

501
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:40,480
That's it!

502
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:01,160
You may enter.

503
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:06,440
-Mind if we talk?
-What ever about?

504
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:08,920
Clarice.

505
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:11,400
Hey. Hey, hey!

506
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:13,200
None of that. She was very upset

507
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:14,600
with your performance
this evening.

508
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:17,200
Now, don't you think
you should give her a chance?

509
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:21,360
I did. And she's a big
phony-baloney if you ask me.

510
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:23,520
I've never heard you
this outspoken.

511
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:25,240
Wouldn't it be nice
to have a mother?

512
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:28,480
Yeah, and it'd be nice
to have a father too.

513
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:31,640
-But I... I mean...
-No, sweetheart,

514
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:35,320
I think the person
you're really angry at... is me.

515
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:36,640
You?

516
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,960
-What'd you do?
-Well, I...

517
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:41,680
I haven't been much
of a father lately.

518
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:43,440
I've been working
and I haven't seen you. And...

519
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:45,200
But you know what?
All that's gonna change.

520
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:47,400
Because Clarice is going back
to the city tomorrow.

521
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:50,240
Gee, I hope it was nothing I did.

522
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:51,840
No, no, no. She's got
a wedding to plan.

523
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:53,200
But that means you
and I are gonna

524
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:54,640
get to spend some time together.

525
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:57,400
Get to know each other again.
Is that okay?

526
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:59,320
Yeah? Good.

527
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:02,320
Let's tuck you in,
you little snuggler.

528
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:07,040
-I'll see you tomorrow.
-Okay.

529
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:10,240
Good night, honey.

530
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:11,320
Hey.

531
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:14,360
I like having a father.

532
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:17,640
Well, I like having a daughter.

533
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:18,840
Good night, sweetie.

534
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:26,400
Lights out!

535
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:31,160
Lights out, cabin three.

536
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:49,440
Come on, come on,
this I gotta see.

537
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:51,600
We're gonna get caught,
I just know it.

538
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:56,360
Come on, Frankie,
it's a full moon.

539
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:57,880
Shut up, stupid.

540
00:36:57,960 --> 00:36:59,800
Zombies hear better than dogs.

541
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:13,960
<i>It's a frog!</i>

542
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:20,200
Amanda, scared of a frog?
She's changed all right.

543
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:21,600
Now do you believe me?

544
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:24,160
Yeah, she's one of them
vampire people.

545
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:25,280
Let's get out of here!

546
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:29,920
A frog, huh?

547
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:31,480
Well, you know what?

548
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:33,760
You should've kissed it.

549
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:36,480
It might've turned out to be
Prince Charming.

550
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:38,480
Gross.

551
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:40,360
Not for you, for me.

552
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:41,840
You've kissed a frog?

553
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:45,240
No, toads are my specialty.

554
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:48,440
Big, old, ugly suckers
with tongues like this.

555
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:50,080
-It is not.
-It is too.

556
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:52,000
How else do you think
I'm gonna catch a guy, huh?

557
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:54,120
I don't know. I don't know.

558
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:55,120
Okay.

559
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:57,800
There's that smile.

560
00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:01,120
And that time I think it went
all the way up to your eyes.

561
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:04,200
You remind me of someone.

562
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:05,960
I do? Who?

563
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:07,920
Someone I've never met.

564
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:10,360
Well, how can I do that
if you've never met her?

565
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:13,960
Sometimes, when I dream,
I think I see her.

566
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:19,800
You know, you've been acting just
a little bit weirdo today, kiddo.

567
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:22,320
I think maybe
it's all this fresh air.

568
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:23,840
Don't make fun.

569
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:26,360
Sorry.

570
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:28,800
It's just that usually,
you're such a tough guy.

571
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:33,000
-Don't tell anyone, okay?
-Scout's honor.

572
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:37,240
I mean, after all, I wouldn't
want to spoil my reputation none.

573
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:38,120
None.

574
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:42,000
I've got an idea.
Let's go spy on the boys.

575
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:00,080
Safe trip, honey.

576
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:40,200
Oh my God!

577
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:43,680
How was the party?

578
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,560
Well, the good news is,
Clarice is gone.

579
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:47,920
You did it!

580
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:51,000
The bad news is,
she'll be back in a week.

581
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:52,680
Oh, you didn't.

582
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:55,080
So what's a cool guy
like your dad doing with

583
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:56,880
a witch like her anyway?

584
00:40:56,920 --> 00:40:59,480
It's too bad he didn't
meet Diane first.

585
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:01,040
Now she's awesome.

586
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:04,080
Yeah, they'd be perfect
for each other.

587
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:10,960
You're not thinking what
I hope you're not thinking.

588
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:12,120
Wanna bet?

589
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:13,800
But he's getting
married next month.

590
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:16,000
So, all they gotta
do is meet once.

591
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:17,880
Then they'll fall in
love for sure.

592
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:18,880
How do you know?

593
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:22,560
Because Diane says when it
happens, it happens like that.

594
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:24,960
Okay, so look,
you go back to Diane

595
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,800
and I'll go back to your dad.

596
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:29,640
Wait, why not
the other way around?

597
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:32,520
Because you know what he likes
and I know what she likes.

598
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:34,600
They need all the help
they can get.

599
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:36,560
But how are we going to
get them together?

600
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:51,800
I can't believe I let
you talk me into this.

601
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:53,640
You're too tense. Relax.

602
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:55,720
Oh, I got 1,000 pounds
of wild animal

603
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:57,480
under my butt and
she says "Relax".

604
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:59,800
Just move with the horse
and you'll be fine.

605
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:02,000
Now when did you become an expert
all of a sudden?

606
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:05,120
Ain't you never seen a Western?

607
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:07,320
Honey, the last Western I saw
was an omelet.

608
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:15,760
Look at your form, young lady.

609
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:17,680
What happened to those
equestrian classes you took?

610
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:20,040
Are you asking me equestrian?

611
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:24,440
Come on, I'll race
you to the lake.

612
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:28,600
No, no. Slow is good.
I like to enjoy the scenery.

613
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:34,560
<i>I've got spurs</i>
<i>that jingle jangle jingle</i>

614
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:39,000
<i>As I ride merrily along</i>

615
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:41,240
Hey, we're doing
a good job, aren't we?

616
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:43,240
I think I'm finally
getting the hang of this.

617
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:45,440
Hey!

618
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:48,120
I'm getting the hang of this!

619
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:53,400
Oh, come on, Amanda,
my voice isn't that bad!

620
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:57,280
Oh, well.

621
00:42:57,680 --> 00:43:00,800
<i>I've been in the desert</i>
<i>on a horse with no name</i>

622
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:03,040
<i>Feels good to get out of the rain</i>

623
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:06,840
Not only is she an excellent
rider, she's a gourmet cook.

624
00:43:07,080 --> 00:43:10,280
She paints. She speaks
four languages.

625
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:13,280
You know, honey, you could
learn a lot from Clarice.

626
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:14,560
Alyssa, there's a...

627
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:16,000
Alyssa.

628
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:18,160
Alyssa?

629
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:20,240
Honey?

630
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:24,440
Alyssa?

631
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:33,680
Come here, come here.

632
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:38,360
<i>I'm jiggling</i>

633
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:44,720
Where is that girl?

634
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:46,800
Did you bring it?

635
00:43:58,320 --> 00:43:59,280
Whoa, bud.

636
00:44:04,120 --> 00:44:06,000
Somebody, turn this thing off!

637
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:09,800
Wow.

638
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:11,600
Alyssa!

639
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:19,080
Stop this right now!
I'm telling you!

640
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:20,040
Step on it!

641
00:44:20,120 --> 00:44:21,440
Help me! Somebody!

642
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:28,760
-Step on it!
-Yeah!

643
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:36,120
Oh, God! Please!

644
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:38,440
Oh, dear. Oh, my.

645
00:44:47,720 --> 00:44:48,600
Help!

646
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:51,040
Help me!

647
00:44:51,320 --> 00:44:53,080
Somebody help me!

648
00:44:54,280 --> 00:44:55,160
Hang on.

649
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:58,560
Hang on! Hang on!

650
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:00,120
Hang on.

651
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:04,600
-Help me, someone!
-Hang on. Slow down, girl.

652
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:06,600
Oh, God, don't talk to me,
talk to the horse.

653
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:07,760
I was talking to the horse.

654
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:10,040
Okay. It's okay, it's okay.
It's okay

655
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:14,080
No! I'm on a killer!
They gave me a killer horse!

656
00:45:14,120 --> 00:45:16,720
Relax, it's okay.
You're gonna be okay.

657
00:45:17,080 --> 00:45:18,320
Okay.

658
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:25,200
You okay?

659
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:28,160
Lord Almighty, I about dropped
my transmission back there.

660
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:30,600
Ah, well,
if it's any consolation,

661
00:45:30,680 --> 00:45:33,040
I used to look like
a real jerk on a horse.

662
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:41,000
How many fingers here, cowboy?

663
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:44,520
-Six.
-Close enough.

664
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:46,640
-Can you stand?
-Yeah.

665
00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:52,280
I'm not sure which is more
bruised, my butt or my ego.

666
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:54,000
You should have somebody
take a look at that.

667
00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:55,800
-My butt?
-No.

668
00:45:56,080 --> 00:45:57,440
That cut right there.

669
00:45:57,720 --> 00:46:00,000
-Sorry.
-Oh, great.

670
00:46:00,360 --> 00:46:02,200
You know what? We have first
aid over at the camp.

671
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:04,160
Well, thanks,
I just live over here.

672
00:46:06,440 --> 00:46:07,520
Are you Roger Callaway?

673
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:10,160
-I... I think so.
-The Roger Callaway?

674
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:12,040
From the Callaway Foundation
for Kids?

675
00:46:12,080 --> 00:46:13,400
Yeah, that's me.

676
00:46:13,560 --> 00:46:15,840
I'm Diane Barrows. You know,
I always wanted to meet you.

677
00:46:15,880 --> 00:46:17,880
My kids just love your camp.

678
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:19,200
Oh, yeah? You... You have kids?

679
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:20,960
Well, they're not mine,
I work for the East Side

680
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:22,880
Children's Center in Manhattan
and we're here for a week.

681
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:24,320
Yeah, of course.

682
00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:28,080
Well, it was very nice
to meet you, Mr. Callaway.

683
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:30,520
-Roger, please.
-Roger.

684
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:34,320
Oh, and, and thank you
for saving my life.

685
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:37,880
And you really should put
some iodine on your butt.

686
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:39,600
Cut.

687
00:46:40,680 --> 00:46:43,240
-Miss Barrows.
-Diane.

688
00:46:43,560 --> 00:46:46,280
Diane, uh, I was wondering
if I could offer you

689
00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:47,800
some, uh, iced tea or something.

690
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:51,160
I'd love to hear more about the
camp and how it's all going.

691
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:52,400
Only if we can walk.

692
00:46:52,840 --> 00:46:54,440
You took the words
right out of my mouth.

693
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:56,240
-Yes!
-Come on.

694
00:46:57,440 --> 00:46:58,400
-Now lay still.
-Yeah.

695
00:47:02,840 --> 00:47:05,400
You certainly are
an angel of mercy, Miss Barrows.

696
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:07,480
Oh, I see worse cuts
than this every day.

697
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:08,480
Thanks, Vincenzo.

698
00:47:08,520 --> 00:47:11,120
My gang's always inventing
new ways to get hurt.

699
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:12,400
You must really love children.

700
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:13,760
Well, what's not to love?

701
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:19,920
You big baby. Come here.

702
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:23,280
Is that better?

703
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:30,080
Yeah.

704
00:47:37,360 --> 00:47:39,480
I can't hear anything.

705
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:41,480
We've gotta get closer.

706
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:46,040
You know, um... you're not
at all what I expected.

707
00:47:46,080 --> 00:47:48,200
Yeah. What were you expecting?

708
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:50,640
Well, blue blood, for one thing.

709
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,640
I sort of thought you'd be
some rich, big, old, fat geezer

710
00:47:54,680 --> 00:47:55,640
who smokes cigars.

711
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:59,080
Really? No, I made my money
the old-fashioned way.

712
00:47:59,120 --> 00:48:01,400
-Pure dumb luck.
-I doubt that.

713
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:02,680
Nope, I swear to God.

714
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:04,280
About 12 years ago,
a cellular phone

715
00:48:04,320 --> 00:48:05,480
was just something
out of Star Trek.

716
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:09,760
But I thought it was pretty cool
so... I bought the airspace.

717
00:48:09,800 --> 00:48:11,040
-Get out!
-Yeah.

718
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:14,600
Oh, my God. Uh, that... that's
like money out of thin air.

719
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:17,200
You'll notice I don't carry one.
I hate the damn things.

720
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:20,400
Excuse me, Miss Kensington, boss.

721
00:48:20,680 --> 00:48:21,880
She insists.

722
00:48:23,080 --> 00:48:25,800
Excuse me, it's my...
Miss Kensington.

723
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:29,320
Hi, Clarice, how you doing?

724
00:48:29,840 --> 00:48:31,760
<i>How am I doing?</i>

725
00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:36,640
Please. Honey, look, honey...

726
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:42,400
Do you have any idea
what your daughter has done?

727
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:45,360
<i>-No, what?</i>
-She spit...

728
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:46,960
Gum? In your hair?

729
00:48:48,920 --> 00:48:50,840
-Are you sure?
-Am I sure?

730
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:53,600
Oh, my God, you should see it!

731
00:48:54,040 --> 00:48:55,920
Well, I'm certain it
wasn't intentional.

732
00:48:56,240 --> 00:48:58,600
Look, of course,
you've had a rough day.

733
00:48:58,640 --> 00:48:59,760
<i>No, no...</i>

734
00:48:59,800 --> 00:49:01,640
..."rough" is
a broken nail, darling.

735
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:04,040
What I've had is a train wreck!

736
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:06,320
Look, just try to calm down,
I'll speak to her...

737
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:07,360
You know what, Roger? Excuse me,

738
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:08,800
I think I'm just gonna go now.

739
00:49:08,840 --> 00:49:10,640
Just one second,
one second, please.

740
00:49:13,240 --> 00:49:15,880
Wait, Roger. Is there a woman
there with you, Roger?

741
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:17,680
Yes, there's sort
of a woman here,

742
00:49:17,720 --> 00:49:19,400
she's from the camp
across the lake.

743
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:24,320
How delightful.
I'm in the middle of a crisis

744
00:49:24,360 --> 00:49:26,960
and you're having
a bachelor party.

745
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,000
I'm in a meeting, that's all.

746
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:30,640
It's just a meeting.

747
00:49:32,840 --> 00:49:34,560
Look, no, we're not
gonna have dinner.

748
00:49:34,600 --> 00:49:36,000
There's nothing gonna go on...

749
00:49:37,160 --> 00:49:38,040
Please...

750
00:49:38,520 --> 00:49:39,840
I'll see you at
the end of the week.

751
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:42,920
Okay. Me too. Bye-bye.

752
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:44,160
I'm so sorry...

753
00:49:52,280 --> 00:49:53,360
Sorry about that.

754
00:49:56,880 --> 00:50:00,320
But she squeezed me so hard,
it just sort of popped out.

755
00:50:00,920 --> 00:50:01,840
Uh-huh.

756
00:50:02,080 --> 00:50:04,000
Don't think
she likes me very much.

757
00:50:04,040 --> 00:50:05,520
Sweetheart, she's been looking

758
00:50:05,560 --> 00:50:07,240
forward to meeting
you for months.

759
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:09,320
Do you have any idea how much
she loves children?

760
00:50:10,280 --> 00:50:11,960
No. Do you?

761
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:15,520
Well... come to think of it,

762
00:50:15,560 --> 00:50:16,960
you are the first kid
I've ever seen her with.

763
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:18,400
But I'm sure it's a whole bunch.

764
00:50:18,680 --> 00:50:20,080
And you love her, right?

765
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:24,040
Well... yes.

766
00:50:24,080 --> 00:50:27,400
Like that can't-eat, can't-sleep,
reach-for-the-stars,

767
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:30,000
over-the-fence
World Series kind of stuff?

768
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:32,680
Is that what it says
in the dictionary?

769
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,000
And you're marrying her
because Alyssa needs...

770
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:37,760
I mean, I, I need a mother.

771
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:42,840
Honey, I think that's
enough questions for today.

772
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:45,400
Wait. I only got one left.

773
00:50:46,760 --> 00:50:47,640
Let's have it.

774
00:50:48,280 --> 00:50:50,640
Who was that pretty woman
out on the patio?

775
00:50:52,680 --> 00:50:54,120
<i>The Roger Callaway?</i>

776
00:50:55,360 --> 00:50:57,000
On a white horse, no less.

777
00:50:57,840 --> 00:50:58,720
So?

778
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:02,640
So, he comes riding up,
saves my life.

779
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:04,800
He's probably worth
a billion dollars.

780
00:51:04,840 --> 00:51:07,800
He's totally cute.
Oh, my God, he's so cute.

781
00:51:08,200 --> 00:51:11,800
And to top it all off,
he's, honest to God, a nice guy.

782
00:51:12,120 --> 00:51:14,480
And I'm just stupid enough
to think he's available.

783
00:51:14,520 --> 00:51:16,280
-Isn't he?
-No.

784
00:51:16,520 --> 00:51:17,640
Is too!

785
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:20,320
How would you know?

786
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:22,080
Was he wearing a ring?

787
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:28,480
Look, even if he was available,
he wouldn't be interested in me.

788
00:51:28,520 --> 00:51:30,320
You shouldn't put yourself down.

789
00:51:30,360 --> 00:51:32,560
Guys like him like
girls with food names.

790
00:51:34,760 --> 00:51:38,200
Cookie, Muffin, Candy.

791
00:51:38,440 --> 00:51:39,800
They don't marry girls like me.

792
00:51:40,080 --> 00:51:41,200
He did once.

793
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:43,480
What is this,
published somewhere?

794
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:46,440
Her name was Kathy and she wasn't
a food, she was a teacher.

795
00:51:48,080 --> 00:51:49,720
He's even more perfect
than I thought.

796
00:51:50,320 --> 00:51:52,520
I'm cheating,
give me one of those.

797
00:51:53,840 --> 00:51:54,840
Give me that stick.

798
00:51:57,800 --> 00:51:58,680
<i>Vincenzo?</i>

799
00:51:59,160 --> 00:52:00,200
<i>Do you believe in magic?</i>

800
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:01,600
You mean like card tricks?

801
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:03,520
No. Sparks between two people.

802
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:05,760
The thing that happens
when you least expect it.

803
00:52:06,080 --> 00:52:06,960
Why do you ask?

804
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:11,280
I... I no reason, just...

805
00:52:11,640 --> 00:52:13,960
It's been so long
since Kathy and...

806
00:52:16,440 --> 00:52:18,120
I just didn't think
it could happen to me again.

807
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:22,640
Well, that Miss Kensington
is really something.

808
00:52:23,720 --> 00:52:25,480
Well, actually...

809
00:52:26,200 --> 00:52:28,240
...that's not who I meant.

810
00:52:28,840 --> 00:52:30,800
Yeah, I know.

811
00:52:34,560 --> 00:52:35,680
Well, you're my best man.

812
00:52:36,360 --> 00:52:37,240
Aren't you supposed
to come up with

813
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:38,640
some words of wisdom
right about now?

814
00:52:41,360 --> 00:52:42,720
Why don't you go for a drive?

815
00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:44,560
See where you end up.

816
00:52:55,840 --> 00:52:57,280
Where's he going?

817
00:52:58,160 --> 00:52:59,080
Hey, Vinny!

818
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:09,400
It's the home office.
The Butkis' want Amanda.

819
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:10,840
The paperwork just went through.

820
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:11,880
Well...

821
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:14,360
Hi, who the hell is this?

822
00:53:15,560 --> 00:53:17,240
Oh, yeah? Well, this
is Diane Barrows.

823
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:19,520
And since when does your
department okay an adoption

824
00:53:19,560 --> 00:53:21,120
without the case worker's report?

825
00:53:22,840 --> 00:53:24,400
Yeah, I know
these people are nice.

826
00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:28,120
Yes. Yes. Look, have you
ever met those people?

827
00:53:28,840 --> 00:53:31,480
These people collect kids,
they will take anybody.

828
00:53:49,240 --> 00:53:51,240
Excuse me, can you tell me
where Diane Barrows is, please?

829
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:53,840
-I think she's in the office.
-Come on, let's go!

830
00:53:54,040 --> 00:53:56,120
Let me just run this by you
one more time, okay?

831
00:53:56,160 --> 00:53:58,800
Just, please, just...
Just hear me out one more time.

832
00:53:59,160 --> 00:54:02,640
Okay, I know I don't make that
much money and I know that...

833
00:54:02,680 --> 00:54:06,640
Um, I'm a little bit single,
but I want to adopt Amanda.

834
00:54:07,640 --> 00:54:10,960
No! I... Are you laughing at me?
He's laughing at me!

835
00:54:11,240 --> 00:54:13,840
You... You stupid jerk!

836
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:24,640
-Diane?
-What?

837
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:27,280
It's you.

838
00:54:29,080 --> 00:54:30,240
Did I come at a bad time?

839
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:33,400
A bad time for a "meeting"?

840
00:54:34,920 --> 00:54:37,600
No, I'm just having a little
problem with one of my kids.

841
00:54:37,640 --> 00:54:38,880
Is there anything
I can do to help?

842
00:54:38,920 --> 00:54:41,360
You've already saved my life,
Mr. Callaway.

843
00:54:41,680 --> 00:54:42,800
What can I do for you?

844
00:54:44,560 --> 00:54:46,360
I would like to apologize
for yesterday.

845
00:54:46,520 --> 00:54:48,600
It was very rude. I never
should have taken that call

846
00:54:48,680 --> 00:54:50,800
and I would like to
make it up to you.

847
00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:52,680
Okay, then give me your car.

848
00:54:56,440 --> 00:54:58,080
Well, perhaps we could discuss it
over lunch

849
00:54:58,120 --> 00:55:00,240
at a little pizza
joint I saw in town.

850
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:02,160
Oh, I'm sorry. I can't.

851
00:55:04,440 --> 00:55:05,320
I understand.

852
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:06,960
Maybe some other time then.

853
00:55:07,400 --> 00:55:08,880
No, it's not like that.

854
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:11,960
It's that I'm on duty today
in the mess hall.

855
00:55:12,680 --> 00:55:15,960
-It's my kids' turn to serve.
-Oh, I see.

856
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:17,600
But, you know what?
If your heart's set on Italian,

857
00:55:17,680 --> 00:55:18,680
you could join us.

858
00:55:19,120 --> 00:55:22,000
We're having macaroni and cheese.

859
00:55:22,040 --> 00:55:23,360
Still come with a peach cobbler?

860
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:25,360
Oh, yeah. All you can eat.

861
00:55:33,840 --> 00:55:36,800
<i>Muffy, darling, Craig can</i>
<i>meet the President on Sunday.</i>

862
00:55:36,840 --> 00:55:39,400
<i>I need bridesmaids.</i>

863
00:55:40,200 --> 00:55:41,400
You must come.

864
00:55:42,760 --> 00:55:44,240
Fabulous!

865
00:55:44,680 --> 00:55:46,920
There's my other line. Gotta
go, love you, mean it, ciao.

866
00:55:47,840 --> 00:55:50,320
Hello? Bernard.

867
00:55:51,320 --> 00:55:54,480
Bernard, why do you keep
bothering me with numbers?

868
00:55:54,520 --> 00:55:56,840
It's my wedding.
Whatever it costs, just get it!

869
00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:09,120
It's a cozy little spot.

870
00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:11,200
When was the last time
you were here?

871
00:56:11,240 --> 00:56:12,600
It must be 10 years.

872
00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:14,120
-Ten years?
-Yeah.

873
00:56:14,320 --> 00:56:16,720
What'd you do, build the camp
and then never come back?

874
00:56:16,760 --> 00:56:19,800
No, it was my wife's idea.
She had a very, very big heart.

875
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:20,880
Had?

876
00:56:20,920 --> 00:56:22,800
She passed away
when Alyssa was born.

877
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:24,760
Sorry.

878
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:26,640
I just never could come back.

879
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:28,640
Until now, that is.

880
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:45,280
Here you go.

881
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:48,040
Hi, Carmen. Where's Amanda?

882
00:56:48,080 --> 00:56:50,680
I don't know. One minute she's
behind me and the next...

883
00:56:50,720 --> 00:56:51,760
Will you get her for me, please?

884
00:56:51,800 --> 00:56:53,120
I want to introduce her
to someone.

885
00:56:53,600 --> 00:56:54,480
Sure.

886
00:56:56,360 --> 00:56:58,800
I'm having the hardest time
keeping tabs on this girl.

887
00:56:58,840 --> 00:56:59,960
She keeps running off.

888
00:57:00,560 --> 00:57:03,040
Tell me about it.
I got one just like her at home.

889
00:57:34,240 --> 00:57:35,800
-What are you doing?
-I'm...

890
00:57:35,840 --> 00:57:39,480
Uh... cleaning this window.
Look at it, it's filthy.

891
00:57:39,520 --> 00:57:41,000
Diane wants to see you, come on.

892
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:43,480
But... But... I...

893
00:57:44,440 --> 00:57:46,000
Hey, where you
going with my hat?

894
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:50,640
Do something, Alyssa.

895
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:53,440
Here she comes now.

896
00:57:59,280 --> 00:58:00,760
My compliments to the chef.

897
00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:04,640
Amanda, take that thing off.

898
00:58:05,680 --> 00:58:06,760
Let her keep it on.

899
00:58:06,800 --> 00:58:08,320
For all we know,
it might be the latest thing.

900
00:58:48,560 --> 00:58:50,080
Excuse me, ma'am...

901
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:53,000
...did you just snort?

902
00:58:57,880 --> 00:58:59,800
I suppose you think
this is funny.

903
00:59:01,960 --> 00:59:05,640
Well, maybe you'll get
a little chuckle out of this.

904
00:59:05,680 --> 00:59:06,840
You wouldn't dare.

905
00:59:09,560 --> 00:59:11,120
Food fight!

906
00:59:27,680 --> 00:59:29,600
That was great!

907
00:59:29,640 --> 00:59:31,800
I couldn't have done
it better myself.

908
00:59:32,120 --> 00:59:33,880
I almost had a heart attack.

909
00:59:51,680 --> 00:59:55,400
I... I guess that's what they
mean by "eat and run", huh?

910
00:59:55,760 --> 00:59:57,160
We need doggy bags.

911
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:01,600
Damn, look at me,
I'm covered in cobbler.

912
01:00:01,640 --> 01:00:02,800
Well, you look good in peach.

913
01:00:02,960 --> 01:00:04,600
Actually, leave it.
I may still be hungry.

914
01:00:07,480 --> 01:00:09,640
I can't believe you hit
me with the butter.

915
01:00:10,760 --> 01:00:12,440
I didn't start it.
You just talked

916
01:00:12,480 --> 01:00:14,200
to that short order
cook of yours.

917
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:16,960
Oh, yeah. Where is she anyway?

918
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:18,200
Look at your head.

919
01:00:19,520 --> 01:00:20,800
You know, if you wanna
get cleaned up,

920
01:00:20,840 --> 01:00:22,120
there's showers right over there.

921
01:00:23,880 --> 01:00:25,280
You know, I've got a better idea.

922
01:00:25,320 --> 01:00:27,800
Will you excuse me?
And maybe hold some of that?

923
01:00:27,960 --> 01:00:28,840
Pardon me.

924
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:41,120
-What's wrong with him?
-Beats me.

925
01:00:41,160 --> 01:00:43,320
I've never seen him
act like this.

926
01:00:55,400 --> 01:00:57,560
I think he's gone mental.

927
01:00:57,600 --> 01:00:59,640
He's got a lot on his mind.

928
01:01:03,840 --> 01:01:06,280
Didn't your mother tell you
not to swim after you eat?

929
01:01:06,680 --> 01:01:09,080
Oh, yeah, I forgot.
I got a cramp!

930
01:01:10,040 --> 01:01:11,000
I can't swim!

931
01:01:17,840 --> 01:01:19,960
No fair. I saved you.

932
01:01:20,680 --> 01:01:22,000
It's too cold.

933
01:01:22,520 --> 01:01:23,640
I'm not going in there.

934
01:01:28,880 --> 01:01:31,000
Come on,
I don't wanna save you right now!

935
01:01:34,080 --> 01:01:36,520
All right, buster,
you better be worth it.

936
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:44,160
Roger?

937
01:01:45,320 --> 01:01:46,360
You're not funny.

938
01:01:47,200 --> 01:01:50,320
Roger? Oh, my God.

939
01:01:50,880 --> 01:01:51,800
Roger?

940
01:01:52,480 --> 01:01:56,200
Say... a guy could drown
waiting for you.

941
01:01:56,440 --> 01:01:58,240
Callaway, I'm gonna kill you!

942
01:01:58,760 --> 01:01:59,960
Banzai!

943
01:02:02,760 --> 01:02:05,400
Roger, I am gonna kill you.

944
01:02:07,120 --> 01:02:09,160
-It's working.
-Look at them.

945
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:13,800
Now that's more like it.

946
01:02:16,640 --> 01:02:18,240
Roger, darling, anyone home?

947
01:02:21,440 --> 01:02:24,160
Well, Miss Kensington,
what a surprise.

948
01:02:24,200 --> 01:02:25,480
We weren't expecting you.

949
01:02:25,520 --> 01:02:27,600
Yes, I know. Where's Roger?

950
01:02:28,240 --> 01:02:31,160
Uh, Mr. Callaway is out
for the afternoon.

951
01:02:31,840 --> 01:02:33,600
Oh, I see.

952
01:02:34,440 --> 01:02:35,400
Well, when he returns,

953
01:02:35,440 --> 01:02:37,400
will you please tell him
I wish to speak with him?

954
01:02:37,440 --> 01:02:39,400
-Yes, ma'am.
-Thank you so much.

955
01:02:45,040 --> 01:02:46,280
I'd like a Diet Coke, please.

956
01:02:46,520 --> 01:02:48,600
One Diet Coke coming up.

957
01:02:51,880 --> 01:02:52,760
With lime.

958
01:03:03,960 --> 01:03:06,120
Fairly early in the day
to be looking at stars.

959
01:03:17,320 --> 01:03:19,360
What do we have here?

960
01:03:26,280 --> 01:03:28,000
-Just like I said.
-You know what,

961
01:03:28,040 --> 01:03:31,120
you can't always be this much
fun, because it wouldn't be fair.

962
01:03:31,160 --> 01:03:33,640
Trust me, I haven't done
anything like this in years.

963
01:03:34,080 --> 01:03:35,280
Well, it feels good, doesn't it?

964
01:03:36,960 --> 01:03:38,200
Feels better every second.

965
01:03:39,760 --> 01:03:41,280
-Uh, don't move.
-Why?

966
01:03:41,320 --> 01:03:43,520
-There's a thing.
-What do you mean "a thing"?

967
01:03:43,560 --> 01:03:46,080
-It's a little...
-A bug? A bug?

968
01:03:46,120 --> 01:03:47,440
-It's a... It's a...
-A bug? What kind of...

969
01:03:47,480 --> 01:03:50,320
It's right here.
A maraschino bug.

970
01:03:50,360 --> 01:03:52,200
It's highly poisonous.

971
01:03:52,520 --> 01:03:54,400
And you wanted to go for pizza.

972
01:04:00,160 --> 01:04:01,800
I almost didn't come over at all.

973
01:04:02,600 --> 01:04:03,680
I'm glad you did.

974
01:04:05,480 --> 01:04:06,360
Diane?

975
01:04:17,800 --> 01:04:18,680
What was that?

976
01:04:20,920 --> 01:04:23,000
-It's a sign.
-What do you mean "a sign"?

977
01:04:24,680 --> 01:04:26,280
I mean, I don't know
what I mean. I...

978
01:04:27,040 --> 01:04:28,360
I think I know what you mean.

979
01:04:29,480 --> 01:04:31,280
It's your Miss Kensington, right?

980
01:04:34,240 --> 01:04:35,640
I'm getting married next month.

981
01:04:36,400 --> 01:04:38,160
Well, of course you are.

982
01:04:49,920 --> 01:04:52,800
So what was this?
Just sort of a last fling?

983
01:04:53,480 --> 01:04:55,720
I didn't know what this was.
I was hoping to find out.

984
01:04:55,760 --> 01:04:58,000
Oh, Rog, don't worry about it.
I can help you out here.

985
01:04:58,480 --> 01:04:59,720
It was nice to meet you.

986
01:05:00,560 --> 01:05:02,080
And thanks for the camp.

987
01:05:03,040 --> 01:05:05,360
Oh, by the way, congratulations.

988
01:05:05,400 --> 01:05:07,760
Diane, please. Diane.

989
01:05:08,600 --> 01:05:09,480
You know what?

990
01:05:10,040 --> 01:05:11,200
This just kills me.

991
01:05:12,040 --> 01:05:14,320
We might've hit this one
out of the park, you and me.

992
01:05:14,880 --> 01:05:16,240
It was there. I know it. That...

993
01:05:17,120 --> 01:05:19,200
...can't-eat, can't sleep,

994
01:05:19,240 --> 01:05:21,000
reach-for-the-stars,
over-the-fence

995
01:05:21,440 --> 01:05:23,040
World Series kind of thing.

996
01:05:25,560 --> 01:05:26,440
Oh, well.

997
01:05:33,280 --> 01:05:34,920
I have got to get a dictionary.

998
01:05:37,200 --> 01:05:39,400
They were so close.

999
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,440
Grown-ups, they think too much.

1000
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:45,720
I give up.

1001
01:05:45,760 --> 01:05:47,120
No, we mustn't!

1002
01:05:47,480 --> 01:05:49,120
And why mustn't we?

1003
01:05:49,440 --> 01:05:51,480
Because, third time's the charm.

1004
01:05:51,520 --> 01:05:53,440
-Right?
-Right.

1005
01:05:58,440 --> 01:05:59,640
Boss! Boss!

1006
01:06:00,120 --> 01:06:02,520
-It's Miss Kensington.
-Thanks, Vincenzo.

1007
01:06:02,560 --> 01:06:04,760
-I'll take it down here.
-No, no, no, no.

1008
01:06:04,800 --> 01:06:06,760
Not here. Up there.

1009
01:06:09,680 --> 01:06:12,200
-Up there?
-I'm afraid so.

1010
01:06:16,360 --> 01:06:19,600
-Roger, darling!
-Clarice!

1011
01:06:19,640 --> 01:06:21,240
Your hair. You're here!

1012
01:06:23,280 --> 01:06:25,680
What did you do?
Fall in the lake?

1013
01:06:25,720 --> 01:06:27,480
You know, it's
the funniest thing. I was...

1014
01:06:27,520 --> 01:06:29,200
Aren't you supposed
to be in New York?

1015
01:06:29,240 --> 01:06:31,720
I couldn't bear to be away
from you a moment longer.

1016
01:06:31,760 --> 01:06:33,560
Oh, you were just gone a day.

1017
01:06:33,600 --> 01:06:37,000
I know and I was positively
miserable the entire time.

1018
01:06:37,440 --> 01:06:40,600
Which is why I've decided we
simply mustn't wait another day.

1019
01:06:40,640 --> 01:06:42,440
-To what?
-To be married, silly.

1020
01:06:42,480 --> 01:06:45,040
Oh, next month seems
like an eternity.

1021
01:06:45,080 --> 01:06:47,800
And when two people
are as much in love as we,

1022
01:06:47,840 --> 01:06:50,360
I say what's wrong with tomorrow?

1023
01:06:51,280 --> 01:06:52,160
Tomorrow?

1024
01:06:53,040 --> 01:06:54,960
Darling, you haven't said a word
about my hair.

1025
01:06:59,840 --> 01:07:01,120
Okay, listen to this.

1026
01:07:01,840 --> 01:07:04,640
"Dear Roger, you are
so totally fresh."

1027
01:07:04,680 --> 01:07:07,440
"Just thinking about you
drives me mental."

1028
01:07:07,480 --> 01:07:10,240
"Meet me at that place
we met with the horses."

1029
01:07:10,280 --> 01:07:12,480
"7:00 tonight. Love, Diane."

1030
01:07:12,760 --> 01:07:15,640
-How's that?
-Very romantic.

1031
01:07:15,680 --> 01:07:17,240
-Wanna hear mine?
-Yep.

1032
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:19,040
"Dear Diane..."

1033
01:07:21,520 --> 01:07:25,280
<i>"Dear Diane, ever since the first</i>
<i>time I saw you riding a horse,"</i>

1034
01:07:25,440 --> 01:07:27,160
<i>"I can't stop thinking about it."</i>

1035
01:07:27,200 --> 01:07:28,600
<i>"And I know we were</i>
<i>disturbed at the lake"</i>

1036
01:07:28,680 --> 01:07:30,000
<i>"when the canoes fell over,"</i>

1037
01:07:30,040 --> 01:07:33,320
<i>"but I must see you again where</i>
<i>I saved your life at 7:30."</i>

1038
01:07:35,040 --> 01:07:37,400
<i>"Yours truly, Roger Callaway."</i>

1039
01:07:44,320 --> 01:07:45,200
Yes!

1040
01:07:50,640 --> 01:07:53,000
There you are,
my little gum-chewing assailant.

1041
01:07:53,600 --> 01:07:56,600
-You're back.
-What, no big hug hello?

1042
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:58,800
You're not supposed to be here.

1043
01:07:59,400 --> 01:08:01,120
In a perfect world,
dear, neither are you.

1044
01:08:01,160 --> 01:08:03,000
Now get packed,
we're leaving for the city.

1045
01:08:03,040 --> 01:08:05,200
Right now? It's too soon.

1046
01:08:06,240 --> 01:08:08,800
Maybe I didn't make myself clear.

1047
01:08:09,320 --> 01:08:11,800
We're leaving tonight.

1048
01:08:12,400 --> 01:08:14,240
This little act of
yours is getting old.

1049
01:08:14,840 --> 01:08:18,480
-What act?
-Oh, please.

1050
01:08:18,520 --> 01:08:21,360
By the time I was your age, I'd
been through three step-mothers,

1051
01:08:21,400 --> 01:08:24,000
so I know all about the lengths
that little girls will go through

1052
01:08:24,040 --> 01:08:25,760
to keep Daddy all to themselves.

1053
01:08:26,280 --> 01:08:28,880
Hey, you got that
all wrong, lady.

1054
01:08:29,040 --> 01:08:30,880
Alyssa, don't be rude.
I am talking.

1055
01:08:32,080 --> 01:08:34,280
What was I saying? Oh, yes.

1056
01:08:34,760 --> 01:08:38,840
You have had Roger to yourself
for nine wonderful years,

1057
01:08:38,880 --> 01:08:41,800
but after tomorrow,
I'm the woman of the house.

1058
01:08:41,840 --> 01:08:44,880
And you're off to
a year-round boarding school.

1059
01:08:45,440 --> 01:08:46,800
Possibly in Tibet.

1060
01:08:48,040 --> 01:08:49,640
Did you say tomorrow?

1061
01:08:53,520 --> 01:08:54,960
Should I have come here?

1062
01:08:57,360 --> 01:08:58,840
Yes, stupid.

1063
01:08:58,880 --> 01:09:03,000
He's only worth about 20 billion
dollars for God's sakes.

1064
01:09:03,640 --> 01:09:06,480
Right, now I'm just after him
for his money.

1065
01:09:06,800 --> 01:09:08,040
How shallow is that?

1066
01:09:08,520 --> 01:09:10,760
I liked him before
I knew he was rich.

1067
01:09:13,280 --> 01:09:14,640
So I should've come here.

1068
01:09:15,320 --> 01:09:17,080
Okay, so, he's
a little bit engaged.

1069
01:09:17,600 --> 01:09:18,480
But...

1070
01:09:21,040 --> 01:09:23,200
...I've never met her,
so maybe that doesn't count.

1071
01:09:23,200 --> 01:09:24,080
No.

1072
01:09:24,600 --> 01:09:25,480
God.

1073
01:09:29,440 --> 01:09:30,840
Come on, ladies, perk up.

1074
01:09:38,680 --> 01:09:41,560
Come on, Amanda,
we're missing the fireworks!

1075
01:09:42,160 --> 01:09:44,240
Amanda. Amanda.

1076
01:09:45,240 --> 01:09:48,200
Amanda, this is Miss Van Dyke,
she's from Children's Services.

1077
01:09:48,240 --> 01:09:49,520
Hello there, little lady.

1078
01:09:49,560 --> 01:09:52,200
I believe I have some
very good news for you.

1079
01:09:53,560 --> 01:09:56,040
Come to mama, sweetheart.

1080
01:10:00,480 --> 01:10:04,640
I feel pretty
ding-dang-dong stupid.

1081
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:09,080
-But my name's Amanda!
-Alyssa, stop it.

1082
01:10:10,800 --> 01:10:11,800
Come on, honey.

1083
01:10:12,600 --> 01:10:15,440
Do we have to listen to this
the whole way?

1084
01:10:19,680 --> 01:10:22,360
Oh, great,
now I'm gonna be roadkill.

1085
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:29,640
Diane, help!

1086
01:10:29,680 --> 01:10:31,160
Wait a minute,
what are you doing?

1087
01:10:32,960 --> 01:10:33,840
Damn!

1088
01:10:36,200 --> 01:10:37,640
You were supposed to protect her!

1089
01:10:38,080 --> 01:10:39,200
You should've done something.

1090
01:10:39,280 --> 01:10:41,280
You could've slit their tires
or something, anything!

1091
01:10:41,320 --> 01:10:43,600
-They had the paperwork.
-What paperwork?

1092
01:10:43,680 --> 01:10:45,680
We couldn't find you!
Miss Van Dyke was here.

1093
01:10:45,720 --> 01:10:46,840
What did you want
us to do, lie in

1094
01:10:46,880 --> 01:10:48,240
front of the van for God's sake?

1095
01:10:48,920 --> 01:10:50,160
I would have.

1096
01:10:51,680 --> 01:10:52,920
I'm taking the Jeep.

1097
01:10:53,680 --> 01:10:56,640
-Hey, that's the camp's.
-Oh, don't you give me...

1098
01:10:58,960 --> 01:11:00,360
<i>Lots of tie-ups this morning.</i>

1099
01:11:00,400 --> 01:11:03,120
<i>And it's 20 minutes for the</i>
<i>Lincoln, 10 for the Holland.</i>

1100
01:11:03,160 --> 01:11:05,560
<i>The BQE's backed up</i>
<i>for about two miles</i>

1101
01:11:05,600 --> 01:11:08,560
<i>and if you're taking the Van Wyck</i>
<i>better allow an extra 15.</i>

1102
01:11:08,600 --> 01:11:10,560
<i>Whatever you do,</i>
<i>stay out of Midtown.</i>

1103
01:11:10,600 --> 01:11:11,960
<i>It's going to be</i>
<i>wall-to-wall limos</i>

1104
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:15,520
<i>as socialite Clarice Kensington</i>
<i>finally lands her man.</i>

1105
01:11:17,480 --> 01:11:19,400
<i>Now these little</i>
<i>nincompoops over here</i>

1106
01:11:19,440 --> 01:11:20,680
<i>are your new brothers</i>
<i>and sisters.</i>

1107
01:11:20,720 --> 01:11:24,200
Now from the left you got
Bubba, Bridget, Brenda,

1108
01:11:24,280 --> 01:11:29,560
Bonnie, Billy, Bobby,
Ben and little Harry Jr.

1109
01:11:29,600 --> 01:11:30,920
-Now he's ours.
-Oh...

1110
01:11:31,280 --> 01:11:34,000
Oh, look here, there's
been a big mistake.

1111
01:11:34,040 --> 01:11:36,760
You see, my name is not Amanda.

1112
01:11:37,240 --> 01:11:39,840
-We know that, honey.
-You do?

1113
01:11:39,880 --> 01:11:43,880
Sure. And you will never
have to be Amanda again.

1114
01:11:43,960 --> 01:11:46,120
That's right,
because from now on,

1115
01:11:46,160 --> 01:11:49,640
you're gonna be
little Betty Butkis.

1116
01:11:49,680 --> 01:11:52,840
Huh? Now kids, scoot over and
give Betty here some Cocoa Puffs.

1117
01:11:52,880 --> 01:11:56,200
Oh, and after breakfast,
we're gonna go down

1118
01:11:56,280 --> 01:11:57,920
and see where your daddy works.

1119
01:11:58,680 --> 01:12:00,200
Isn't that gonna be fun?

1120
01:12:05,840 --> 01:12:06,920
<i>Callaway residence.</i>

1121
01:12:07,440 --> 01:12:08,400
<i>One moment, please.</i>

1122
01:12:08,680 --> 01:12:10,240
<i>Miss Callaway, it's for you.</i>

1123
01:12:12,400 --> 01:12:14,240
Hello, this is Miss Callaway.

1124
01:12:14,720 --> 01:12:16,880
<i>Amanda, I can't talk long.</i>

1125
01:12:16,920 --> 01:12:20,240
It's me, Alyssa.
Or should I say...

1126
01:12:23,040 --> 01:12:24,600
Betty Butkis.

1127
01:12:24,640 --> 01:12:26,800
Oh, no! I'm adopted?

1128
01:12:30,560 --> 01:12:32,800
Those guys scary or what?

1129
01:12:32,840 --> 01:12:34,400
What happened yesterday?

1130
01:12:34,440 --> 01:12:37,000
<i>-Are you sitting down?</i>
-Yeah, kind of.

1131
01:12:37,680 --> 01:12:39,240
Clarice moved up the wedding.

1132
01:12:39,280 --> 01:12:43,640
<i>Your dad's getting married</i>
<i>in two hours and 12 minutes.</i>

1133
01:12:43,840 --> 01:12:45,360
Oh, no. What do we do now?

1134
01:12:45,400 --> 01:12:48,400
<i>I don't know, but it's gonna</i>
<i>have to be something major.</i>

1135
01:12:48,440 --> 01:12:51,840
And quick. Amanda,
you've got to get me out of here.

1136
01:12:52,120 --> 01:12:53,920
These people aren't just scary.
They're...

1137
01:12:56,040 --> 01:12:56,920
Amanda?

1138
01:12:57,320 --> 01:12:58,240
Alyssa?

1139
01:12:58,720 --> 01:12:59,760
Alyssa!

1140
01:13:03,320 --> 01:13:05,400
New kids aren't allowed
to use the phone.

1141
01:13:05,440 --> 01:13:07,000
Butkis rules.

1142
01:13:12,240 --> 01:13:16,080
Hey, Vin, you've been taking
care of Alyssa all her life.

1143
01:13:16,120 --> 01:13:18,400
-Right?
-Oh, no, Alyssa, not again.

1144
01:13:18,440 --> 01:13:21,720
-Answer the question.
-Yes, from the day she was...

1145
01:13:21,760 --> 01:13:23,240
From the day you were born.

1146
01:13:23,560 --> 01:13:26,480
So you know pretty well
everything about her?

1147
01:13:26,800 --> 01:13:30,320
Every freckle,
every bruise, every scar?

1148
01:13:30,360 --> 01:13:31,800
Yeah, I supposed
you could say that.

1149
01:13:32,280 --> 01:13:34,400
Bet you don't remember this one,
do ya?

1150
01:13:35,520 --> 01:13:37,000
No, that one escapes me.

1151
01:13:37,040 --> 01:13:39,120
Broken bottle, sliding into home.

1152
01:13:40,400 --> 01:13:42,560
Or this one.

1153
01:13:44,320 --> 01:13:46,440
Rusty nail,
right through my shoe.

1154
01:13:46,640 --> 01:13:48,120
Bled for six blocks.

1155
01:13:49,240 --> 01:13:52,200
How about here? Ever seen this?

1156
01:13:52,280 --> 01:13:56,200
-When did you get that?
-Roman candle last 4th of July.

1157
01:13:56,240 --> 01:13:59,040
-Right in the head.
-My God!

1158
01:13:59,560 --> 01:14:01,160
You're not Alyssa.

1159
01:14:01,440 --> 01:14:04,120
Nope, name's Amanda.
Put her there.

1160
01:14:04,160 --> 01:14:06,240
Identical strangers?

1161
01:14:07,120 --> 01:14:09,280
Holy mackerel, that's amazing!

1162
01:14:09,320 --> 01:14:11,160
Yeah, and it's weird too.

1163
01:14:11,440 --> 01:14:14,880
But if you're here with us,
then Alyssa is...

1164
01:14:14,920 --> 01:14:17,480
-In a whole lot of trouble.
-I gotta tell Mr. Callaway.

1165
01:14:17,520 --> 01:14:20,760
Oh, no. Wait!
You can't tell him yet.

1166
01:14:21,120 --> 01:14:24,160
We've gotta get him to see Diane
one more time before the wedding.

1167
01:14:24,200 --> 01:14:27,120
They'll fall in love
and Clarice will be history.

1168
01:14:28,640 --> 01:14:31,640
Where the hell is everybody?

1169
01:14:32,080 --> 01:14:33,440
Vincenzo!

1170
01:14:34,560 --> 01:14:36,920
I sure hope you got a plan.

1171
01:15:05,720 --> 01:15:06,720
Vincenzo?

1172
01:15:08,200 --> 01:15:09,640
What, what are you doing here?

1173
01:15:09,920 --> 01:15:12,400
I came for Mr. Callaway's
daughter, Alyssa.

1174
01:15:13,920 --> 01:15:16,160
You got her, I want her back.

1175
01:15:17,360 --> 01:15:18,320
What are you talking about?

1176
01:15:18,880 --> 01:15:20,160
I don't have Roger
Callaway's daughter,

1177
01:15:20,200 --> 01:15:21,880
I don't even know
Roger Callaway's daughter.

1178
01:15:21,920 --> 01:15:23,160
Oh, oh, yes you do.

1179
01:15:23,800 --> 01:15:26,840
This. This is Alyssa Callaway.

1180
01:15:27,360 --> 01:15:29,760
No, no. You... You gotta get
your eyes checked

1181
01:15:29,800 --> 01:15:32,040
because this is a little girl
named Amanda.

1182
01:15:32,080 --> 01:15:36,000
Oh, oh, no.
No, no. This is your Amanda.

1183
01:15:37,640 --> 01:15:38,520
But...

1184
01:15:44,680 --> 01:15:45,800
Oh, my God.

1185
01:15:47,400 --> 01:15:48,880
Look, they're identical.

1186
01:15:51,520 --> 01:15:53,080
Oh, this is amazing.

1187
01:15:53,120 --> 01:15:55,040
Yeah, and it's weird too.

1188
01:15:56,080 --> 01:15:58,600
Now I understand that
through some, uh...

1189
01:15:58,640 --> 01:16:00,080
some simple mix-up,

1190
01:16:00,440 --> 01:16:04,040
that Alyssa is in the care
of Child Services.

1191
01:16:04,320 --> 01:16:06,120
Now, I've been
authorized to tell you

1192
01:16:06,360 --> 01:16:08,120
that if I get her
back right away,

1193
01:16:08,280 --> 01:16:10,200
there'll be no legal
entanglements.

1194
01:16:13,040 --> 01:16:16,200
You just say...
She's not exactly with me.

1195
01:16:16,280 --> 01:16:18,480
-Here.
-What?

1196
01:16:18,640 --> 01:16:19,520
She's been...

1197
01:16:21,240 --> 01:16:22,960
Well, she's adopted.

1198
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:24,800
Well, then you better
un-adopt her quick.

1199
01:16:25,440 --> 01:16:28,280
Mr. Callaway's getting married in
90 minutes at St. Bartholomew's.

1200
01:16:28,600 --> 01:16:30,880
He's expecting his daughter
to be there, his real daughter.

1201
01:16:30,960 --> 01:16:32,520
-Ninety minutes?
-Yeah.

1202
01:16:33,280 --> 01:16:35,800
Well, I can't even get to Staten
Island and back in 90 minutes.

1203
01:16:35,840 --> 01:16:39,880
Well, can I suggest that
you go really, really fast?

1204
01:16:41,720 --> 01:16:44,200
Here, if you get
into any trouble,

1205
01:16:44,960 --> 01:16:46,240
call this number.

1206
01:16:47,280 --> 01:16:48,720
Ask for Lou.

1207
01:16:50,480 --> 01:16:51,360
Lou.

1208
01:16:52,760 --> 01:16:53,640
Lou who?

1209
01:17:05,760 --> 01:17:08,240
Well, hey. Look at this mess.

1210
01:17:08,600 --> 01:17:09,560
Clean it up.

1211
01:17:09,840 --> 01:17:13,440
-You clean it.
-Betty, put a cork in it, okay?

1212
01:17:13,480 --> 01:17:14,400
He's management.

1213
01:17:17,720 --> 01:17:20,600
My father's Roger Callaway.

1214
01:17:21,040 --> 01:17:24,320
And when he finds out
what you're doing here,

1215
01:17:24,360 --> 01:17:28,240
he's gonna buy this whole town,
and kick you out of it.

1216
01:17:28,840 --> 01:17:30,240
Roger Callaway, huh?

1217
01:17:30,440 --> 01:17:32,160
Well then, how come you
ain't at his wedding?

1218
01:17:34,840 --> 01:17:35,720
Oh, yeah.

1219
01:17:39,320 --> 01:17:41,360
Come on, Diane, you can do it.

1220
01:17:42,120 --> 01:17:43,800
We might have to
stall a little bit.

1221
01:17:44,960 --> 01:17:45,840
How?

1222
01:17:46,880 --> 01:17:47,920
How should I know?

1223
01:17:48,280 --> 01:17:50,160
You're the brains
of this operation.

1224
01:17:50,920 --> 01:17:52,360
<i>I must be crazy.</i>

1225
01:17:52,760 --> 01:17:55,280
<i>I am not going in that church,</i>
<i>no matter what happens,</i>

1226
01:17:55,320 --> 01:17:57,640
<i>I am not going in that church.</i>

1227
01:18:07,560 --> 01:18:09,080
It's only natural to be nervous.

1228
01:18:11,200 --> 01:18:13,240
Actually, I was thinking about
the World Series.

1229
01:18:13,240 --> 01:18:14,120
Baseball?

1230
01:18:16,480 --> 01:18:18,120
Vincenzo, did you
ever hit a homerun?

1231
01:18:18,640 --> 01:18:19,560
Not recently.

1232
01:18:20,440 --> 01:18:22,680
Well, you know the feeling
when it's bottom of the ninth,

1233
01:18:23,240 --> 01:18:24,400
the bases are loaded,

1234
01:18:25,120 --> 01:18:27,960
and you know the next one's
coming right down the middle.

1235
01:18:29,680 --> 01:18:30,560
And then...

1236
01:18:32,280 --> 01:18:33,760
You just connect.

1237
01:18:35,440 --> 01:18:36,640
And, for an instant,

1238
01:18:37,720 --> 01:18:41,280
you know it's going over
the fence and out of the park,

1239
01:18:42,960 --> 01:18:45,160
and further than
you could ever imagine.

1240
01:18:45,200 --> 01:18:46,560
Yeah, that's a great feeling.

1241
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:49,880
Yeah.

1242
01:18:59,040 --> 01:19:00,240
Clarice hates baseball.

1243
01:19:06,720 --> 01:19:08,840
Come on, Seabiscuit,
don't fail me now.

1244
01:19:23,520 --> 01:19:25,880
Hello? Hello?

1245
01:19:25,960 --> 01:19:27,720
You looking for a Butkis?

1246
01:19:27,760 --> 01:19:30,240
-What?
-You looking for a Butkis?

1247
01:19:30,800 --> 01:19:33,560
Yes! Yes, I am.
Do you know where he is?

1248
01:19:33,760 --> 01:19:35,720
At the salvage yard, where else?

1249
01:19:36,320 --> 01:19:38,400
Harry works those poor kids
to the bone.

1250
01:19:38,800 --> 01:19:39,680
What do you mean?

1251
01:19:40,080 --> 01:19:41,720
Why do you think
he's got so many?

1252
01:19:49,760 --> 01:19:52,600
Lou, Lou. Hey, hey, buddy,
can I use your phone?

1253
01:19:52,840 --> 01:19:54,280
Yeah, sure. No charge.

1254
01:20:07,640 --> 01:20:09,520
We've been looking for you,

1255
01:20:09,760 --> 01:20:11,440
Your Highness.

1256
01:20:12,160 --> 01:20:13,800
Leave me alone.

1257
01:20:14,120 --> 01:20:17,600
But, Your Majesty,
we brought you something.

1258
01:20:17,640 --> 01:20:20,920
Yeah, something to make you
feel more at home.

1259
01:20:23,200 --> 01:20:26,000
I knew somebody in this church
would have a Prozac.

1260
01:20:26,840 --> 01:20:28,600
What is taking so long?

1261
01:20:29,040 --> 01:20:31,160
Relax, Clarice, enjoy the moment.

1262
01:20:31,200 --> 01:20:33,200
This is the happiest
day of your life.

1263
01:20:34,720 --> 01:20:37,280
I'm happy. Don't I look happy?

1264
01:20:38,040 --> 01:20:41,400
This is me happy, see?

1265
01:20:41,960 --> 01:20:44,880
Happy, happy, happy,
happy, happy, happy!

1266
01:20:44,920 --> 01:20:46,880
Let's get this show on the road!

1267
01:20:47,680 --> 01:20:51,600
Here's your royal throne,
Alyssa Callaway.

1268
01:20:52,200 --> 01:20:55,520
Hail Betty.
Queen of the scrap heap.

1269
01:20:55,560 --> 01:20:57,200
Hail Betty!

1270
01:20:57,520 --> 01:20:59,880
My name's Alyssa Callaway!

1271
01:20:59,920 --> 01:21:02,600
Yeah, right, and I'm Princess Di.

1272
01:21:07,960 --> 01:21:10,240
<i>Attention, Harry Butkis.</i>

1273
01:21:10,440 --> 01:21:12,800
<i>We're here to pick</i>
<i>up Alyssa Callaway.</i>

1274
01:21:13,200 --> 01:21:17,400
<i>All you kids in the yard,</i>
<i>stand clear. We're coming in.</i>

1275
01:21:42,760 --> 01:21:43,800
Told ya!

1276
01:21:51,320 --> 01:21:54,400
Alyssa Callaway,
I gotta get you to that church.

1277
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:57,200
Hey, that is my kid!

1278
01:21:57,280 --> 01:21:59,000
Get out of my way,
you piece of junk.

1279
01:21:59,040 --> 01:22:00,920
I would love nothing more
than to kill you.

1280
01:22:01,280 --> 01:22:03,880
Before I turn you over to
Social Services.

1281
01:22:27,880 --> 01:22:29,800
Alyssa, go on. Hurry.

1282
01:22:32,760 --> 01:22:34,240
Oh, God.

1283
01:22:34,800 --> 01:22:35,880
Hi, how ya doing?

1284
01:22:36,480 --> 01:22:37,520
Good to see ya.

1285
01:22:39,640 --> 01:22:40,880
Hey, Granny. Nice hat.

1286
01:22:42,400 --> 01:22:43,320
Thanks for coming.

1287
01:22:43,360 --> 01:22:44,640
Get moving.

1288
01:23:02,720 --> 01:23:04,880
Any slower and
she'd be walking backwards.

1289
01:23:05,680 --> 01:23:08,880
Oh, she's... she's just
not herself today.

1290
01:23:11,880 --> 01:23:15,040
<i>We'll never make it.</i>
<i>We only have 10 minutes.</i>

1291
01:23:15,080 --> 01:23:16,240
<i>-So, Lou?</i>
<i>-Yeah?</i>

1292
01:23:16,280 --> 01:23:18,560
<i>How close can you land this thing</i>
<i>to the church?</i>

1293
01:23:18,800 --> 01:23:20,200
<i>Central Park close enough?</i>

1294
01:23:20,560 --> 01:23:22,600
<i>Central Park? The Central Park?</i>

1295
01:23:23,440 --> 01:23:24,320
<i>That will do.</i>

1296
01:23:31,480 --> 01:23:32,400
Play ball!

1297
01:24:03,080 --> 01:24:04,680
Who would've thought
my first little girl

1298
01:24:04,720 --> 01:24:06,240
would be the last to get married?

1299
01:24:06,280 --> 01:24:09,280
Oh, Daddy... Shut up.

1300
01:24:10,600 --> 01:24:11,560
Enough of this.

1301
01:24:29,120 --> 01:24:32,160
Okay. All right, I'm here.
Let's do it.

1302
01:24:33,440 --> 01:24:36,040
De... Dearly beloved, we're
gathered here in the sight of God

1303
01:24:36,080 --> 01:24:40,320
to join in holy matrimony
Clarice and Roger.

1304
01:24:43,200 --> 01:24:45,800
I'm not going in the church,
I'm not going in the church.

1305
01:24:45,840 --> 01:24:48,400
I'm not going in the church,
I'm not going in the church.

1306
01:24:52,040 --> 01:24:52,920
Oh, no.

1307
01:24:53,600 --> 01:24:55,000
Not another horse.

1308
01:24:55,440 --> 01:24:57,320
Diane, come on!

1309
01:24:58,080 --> 01:24:59,360
All right, here we go.

1310
01:25:00,320 --> 01:25:01,400
Where is the driver?

1311
01:25:04,320 --> 01:25:07,640
Oh, hey, buddy! You gotta
take us to St. Bart's right away.

1312
01:25:07,680 --> 01:25:08,640
It's an emergency!

1313
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:11,680
When I close this.
I'm on my break!

1314
01:25:17,440 --> 01:25:19,560
I wanna thank you for
all your help, bud.

1315
01:25:21,160 --> 01:25:23,000
Hey! Hey!

1316
01:25:23,320 --> 01:25:27,160
Hey! That's... That's my horse!

1317
01:25:31,440 --> 01:25:32,400
Faster!

1318
01:25:34,320 --> 01:25:36,840
<i>To have and to hold,</i>
<i>for richer or poorer,</i>

1319
01:25:36,880 --> 01:25:39,440
in sickness and in health
as long as you both shall live?

1320
01:25:39,480 --> 01:25:41,560
I do, I do. I really do. Now him.

1321
01:25:45,160 --> 01:25:47,400
Hit the brakes! Hit the brakes!

1322
01:25:48,040 --> 01:25:49,960
Amanda, there's a black car!

1323
01:25:50,200 --> 01:25:51,080
Come on.

1324
01:25:54,440 --> 01:25:56,720
-Hang on!
-I'm hanging on.

1325
01:25:58,040 --> 01:25:59,800
What street's it on again?

1326
01:25:59,840 --> 01:26:03,280
54th and Park. Are we there yet?

1327
01:26:03,320 --> 01:26:05,040
-Almost.
-Signal!

1328
01:26:07,840 --> 01:26:11,600
And do you, Roger,
take this woman, Clarice,

1329
01:26:11,840 --> 01:26:13,920
to be your lawful wedded wife?

1330
01:26:14,160 --> 01:26:17,240
To have and to hold,
for richer or poorer,

1331
01:26:17,680 --> 01:26:23,120
and in sickness and in health
as long as you both shall live?

1332
01:26:42,440 --> 01:26:44,520
Oh, God. We made it?

1333
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:50,160
Aren't you coming?

1334
01:26:50,760 --> 01:26:54,200
No, I think I'm just gonna
wait for Amanda out here.

1335
01:26:55,280 --> 01:27:01,120
Diane Barrows, get
your butt up here this instant!

1336
01:27:01,640 --> 01:27:03,240
Okay. Okay.

1337
01:27:03,680 --> 01:27:06,400
Maybe I'll just stand in the back
and take a little look-see.

1338
01:27:07,840 --> 01:27:08,720
I...

1339
01:27:12,080 --> 01:27:12,960
I...

1340
01:27:44,440 --> 01:27:45,400
Oh, yes!

1341
01:27:54,320 --> 01:27:55,200
Roger.

1342
01:27:58,240 --> 01:27:59,120
I can't.

1343
01:28:00,960 --> 01:28:01,840
Yes!

1344
01:28:05,760 --> 01:28:08,080
Excuse me, what did you say?

1345
01:28:08,280 --> 01:28:10,040
I'm so sorry, Clarice. I can't.

1346
01:28:15,040 --> 01:28:16,600
I should've said
something earlier.

1347
01:28:25,360 --> 01:28:26,760
I'm in love with someone else.

1348
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:40,240
Guess I deserved that.

1349
01:28:43,280 --> 01:28:46,000
This is all your fault.

1350
01:28:49,440 --> 01:28:55,280
Lady, if you touch that child
I'll pop you one, so help me God.

1351
01:29:11,560 --> 01:29:14,320
Oh, my God, there's two of them.

1352
01:29:14,600 --> 01:29:15,960
It's a conspiracy!

1353
01:29:16,520 --> 01:29:19,480
Well, at least I'll get
to hit one of you.

1354
01:29:19,840 --> 01:29:20,720
Hey!

1355
01:29:21,960 --> 01:29:23,280
Back off, Barbie.

1356
01:29:25,320 --> 01:29:26,280
And by the way,

1357
01:29:26,800 --> 01:29:29,520
you have a little tiny bit of
something here on your teeth.

1358
01:29:32,120 --> 01:29:36,400
I have never been more humiliated
in my life!

1359
01:29:41,760 --> 01:29:42,680
Wanna bet?

1360
01:29:50,720 --> 01:29:52,360
Daddy!

1361
01:29:55,840 --> 01:29:57,040
My God!

1362
01:30:02,920 --> 01:30:04,800
About time you showed up.

1363
01:30:05,080 --> 01:30:06,800
I got here as soon as we could.

1364
01:30:07,640 --> 01:30:08,520
Hi, Daddy.

1365
01:30:15,160 --> 01:30:16,040
You're...

1366
01:30:17,440 --> 01:30:20,360
-This is impossible.
-Nothing's impossible.

1367
01:30:20,400 --> 01:30:23,040
-Right, Alyssa?
-You got that right.

1368
01:30:25,840 --> 01:30:28,240
If... If you're... You're my...

1369
01:30:32,920 --> 01:30:35,320
-Who are you?
-Name's Amanda.

1370
01:30:35,360 --> 01:30:37,280
Put her there. I'm with her.

1371
01:31:06,280 --> 01:31:07,360
Well, I guess we're even.

1372
01:31:08,640 --> 01:31:09,520
What do you mean?

1373
01:31:11,160 --> 01:31:12,120
You saved my life.

1374
01:31:12,840 --> 01:31:14,360
I'm sorry about
spoiling the party.

1375
01:31:14,400 --> 01:31:16,360
I just didn't want the wrong girl
to go down the aisle.

1376
01:31:16,400 --> 01:31:18,200
I mean... I... I mean
the wrong flower girl.

1377
01:31:18,960 --> 01:31:20,320
I think you had it
right the first time.

1378
01:31:21,280 --> 01:31:24,440
Told you, third time's the charm.

1379
01:31:25,320 --> 01:31:26,480
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

1380
01:31:26,840 --> 01:31:28,600
All of this, this was your doing?

1381
01:31:30,880 --> 01:31:32,400
It was, was it?

1382
01:31:33,120 --> 01:31:34,120
Well, ladies,

1383
01:31:34,800 --> 01:31:36,400
what do you have to
say for yourselves?

1384
01:31:38,240 --> 01:31:40,240
-So, kiss already!
-So, kiss already!

1385
01:31:57,360 --> 01:31:58,240
Put her there...

1386
01:31:58,240 --> 01:31:59,120
Sister.

1387
01:32:04,640 --> 01:32:07,560
And it's a high fly ball...

1388
01:32:08,200 --> 01:32:10,280
Over the left field wall.

1389
01:32:13,920 --> 01:32:20,000
Excuse me. This gentleman claims
that the ladies stole his buggy.

1390
01:32:21,240 --> 01:32:22,760
Oh, my God, he's right. We did!

1391
01:32:22,800 --> 01:32:24,360
You did go out of your way.

1392
01:32:24,680 --> 01:32:25,960
It was her idea.

1393
01:32:31,040 --> 01:32:34,560
Vincenzo, I'd like you to ask
that nice gentleman if he'd sell.

1394
01:32:34,600 --> 01:32:35,640
I don't care what it costs.

1395
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:37,800
That horse deserves
a house in the country.

1396
01:32:39,840 --> 01:32:43,240
I trust we can make
some kind of arrangement.

1397
01:32:45,640 --> 01:32:49,160
Well, girls, what do you say
we do a little sightseeing?

1398
01:32:49,480 --> 01:32:52,120
And then you girls can tell us
the whole story.

1399
01:32:52,760 --> 01:32:55,400
Driver, once around the park,
if you please.

1400
01:32:55,480 --> 01:32:57,680
It'll be my pleasure, boss.

1401
01:32:58,960 --> 01:33:00,440
Walk on, Duke.
