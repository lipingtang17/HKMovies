-Mugging, plus one.
-That's quality?

173
00:09:41,083 --> 00:09:44,375
-That the quality you're talking about?
-It's a fucking plus one.

at the Grand Littoral store.

176

In the parking lot, level two.

177
00:09:57,083 --> 00:09:59,083
Um, Car 14, your patrol is over.

178
00:10:00,083 --> 00:10:01,916

[kids yelling playfully]

181
00:10:09,458 --> 00:10:11,291
I went and saw the baby with Nora.

182
00:10:12,333 --> 00:10:13,583
-And?
-Yeah.

183
00:10:14,125 --> 00:10:15,500
It was in 3D. It was weird.

184
00:10:15,583 --> 00:10:17,916
[radio] TV13, head for Le Merlan--

185
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,166
I mean, he looked kinda weird.
He looks like a little alien.

186
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:22,625
What you talking about, 3D?

187
00:10:22,708 --> 00:10:25,458
I mean 3D. I don't know.
You can see the baby in 3D.

188
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:26,541
It's super weird.

189
00:10:26,625 --> 00:10:27,916
You get glasses?

190
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,041
-Huh?
-Glasses.

191
00:10:29,125 --> 00:10:30,791
No, idiot. You're such an idiot.

192
00:10:30,875 --> 00:10:32,708
-The image is in 3D.
-You think that?

193
00:10:32,791 --> 00:10:35,833
It lets you see all the… the baby.

194
00:10:35,916 --> 00:10:37,708
Ehh, it's not actually 3D.

195
00:10:37,791 --> 00:10:40,250
No, not like 3D at the movies. It's not--

196
00:10:40,333 --> 00:10:43,291
-Why'd you say it's 3D like the movies?
-[sighs] Forget it.

197
00:10:44,291 --> 00:10:46,291
-So, no glasses?
-No, no glasses.

198
00:10:46,375 --> 00:10:47,458
OK. That's what's up.

199

-I swear--
-Dickhead.

200
00:10:49,833 --> 00:10:51,083
Does he look like you?

201
00:10:51,583 --> 00:10:53,333
-I think he has my eyes.
-[chuckles]

202
00:10:53,416 --> 00:10:56,583
-As long as he doesn't have your mug.
-I know, right? [chuckles]

203
00:10:56,666 --> 00:10:57,500

-Good, you?

206

Listen, chief,
that ginger friend of yours,

207
00:11:12,458 --> 00:11:14,083
he straight-up
grabbed my cousin yesterday.

208
00:11:14,166 --> 00:11:16,333
He stripped him,
robbed him, and beat him up.

209
00:11:16,416 --> 00:11:18,875
Not cool. What can I say?
He's an asshole. It is what it is.

210
00:11:18,958 --> 00:11:20,083
Could you talk to him for me?

211
00:11:20,166 --> 00:11:22,375
Sure. Enough of your life story.
Got any intel for me?

212
00:11:22,458 --> 00:11:24,416
No, bro. I swear, I just started my shift.

213
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:26,666
-Look, my bag is full.
-Why do you swear?

214
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:28,333
-So you believe me.
-Nothing going on?

215
00:11:28,416 --> 00:11:31,958
Not right now. If I hear anything,
I'll call you. You know that.

216
00:11:32,041 --> 00:11:35,166
-Look, we're just selling our cigarettes.
-OK.

217
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:38,375
-I only sell cigarettes.
-All right, enough. Give me a carton.

218
00:11:39,125 --> 00:11:40,291
-All you.
-OK.

219
00:11:40,375 --> 00:11:41,541
[man] Have a great day.

220
00:11:58,791 --> 00:12:01,208
That's nothing. Don't worry about it.
Nothing there.

221
00:12:01,291 --> 00:12:02,125

222
00:12:03,291 --> 00:12:05,208
[man] Thank you. Thank you very much.

223
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:06,666
Oh, nice to see you!

224
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:08,666
-How's it going, chief?
-How's the family?

225
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:10,958
-Want three kebabs per usual?
-[Antoine] Yes, sir.

226
00:12:11,041 --> 00:12:13,458
Want extra harissa,
lettuce, tomatoes, onions?

[sizzling]

228
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,250
[Antoine] Oh, here we go.

229

-Check out your boy over there.
-Who?

230
00:12:26,541 --> 00:12:28,958
-The guy by the fruit.
-Which guy by the fruit?

231
00:12:29,041 --> 00:12:31,333
[Antoine] The guy right there
with the hoodie.

232
00:12:31,833 --> 00:12:32,791
[Yass] Yeah?

233
00:12:32,875 --> 00:12:35,541
Twenty euros
he's gonna grab that old lady's wallet.

234
00:12:35,625 --> 00:12:38,958
[Yass] No, that guy's too relaxed.
Hands in his pockets, not looking around.

235
00:12:39,041 --> 00:12:40,375
Nah.

236
00:12:40,458 --> 00:12:42,250
-Twenty bucks, you're on.
-Let's go.

Come on, big fella.

She's just a little old lady.

239
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:51,125
-You got this, get busy!
-It's not gonna happen for you.

240
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:57,291
-What's he doing?
-He's holding a melon and smelling it.

241
00:12:57,833 --> 00:12:59,583
Oh no! Goodbye, ma'am.

-Hey! Where's my 20?
-I don't have any cash.

244
00:13:04,291 --> 00:13:06,791
You're such a cheapskate.
You never have any money.

245
00:13:06,875 --> 00:13:09,000
You probably spent it all on that haircut.

246
00:13:09,083 --> 00:13:11,333
-[fake laughs]
-Ask for your money back. There's lunch!

-Ah!
-This is for you.

248
00:13:13,166 --> 00:13:15,000
-[Yass] You hook it up?
-Got your extra meat.

249
00:13:15,083 --> 00:13:17,250
And samurai sauce. Don't worry, I got you.

-Bon appétit, my friends.
-Mm!

251

Shall we get them?

-How many are there?
-[Yass] Two.

Hmm?

255
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:35,958
Nah, I don't do turtles.

What don't you understand?
I don't do turtles.

258

-Bro, in my sauce, you serious?
-"I don't do turtles," that's bullshit.

Ah, you know it. He's delighted.
He wants our response to be, in his words,

[Jérôme] What?

526
00:25:56,125 --> 00:25:58,041
You've wanted
to take these drug networks down.

527
00:25:58,125 --> 00:25:59,208
Here's your ticket.

528
00:25:59,291 --> 00:26:01,375
You said we couldn't go
into ghettos anymore.

529
00:26:01,458 --> 00:26:03,333
Well, things change. Now you have to go.

530

You're sucking up to the prefect?

00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:11,958
this case is yours.

533
00:26:12,541 --> 00:26:16,291
Voila. You run the show.
You pick your team. Whatever you say goes.

534
00:26:16,375 --> 00:26:17,875
-Ah, I dunno.
-[boy] En garde!

[Greg] Whoa! [laughs]

This referee's the fucking worst.

He's all short,
blowing his whistle to make up for it.

541

-[Greg chuckles]
-Yeah, go on. Take notes, take notes.

543

Seriously, that coach gets on my nerves!
Always taking notes. Nose in his notebook!

544
00:26:40,541 --> 00:26:43,375
What's he writing down?
We haven't done anything in 20 minutes!

[chiming]

552
00:27:53,708 --> 00:27:57,458
Do you understand what I'm asking for?
I'm not asking you for a dealer here.

553
00:27:58,208 --> 00:28:01,875
We wanna take down the whole network.
You need to give us some real intel.

554
00:28:02,625 --> 00:28:04,208
A distribution center, you feel me?

555
00:28:04,291 --> 00:28:06,458
You must have a death wish,
asking for that.

556
00:28:06,541 --> 00:28:08,458
-Your cousin's from there.
-My cousin?

557
00:28:08,541 --> 00:28:10,208
What do you think you'll get
from my cousin?

558
00:28:10,291 --> 00:28:13,708
-Then from you.
-You want my cousin to dig my grave?

559
00:28:14,291 --> 00:28:17,541
You haven't been to that neighborhood
in ages. Don't you get what a mess it is?

560
00:28:17,625 --> 00:28:18,708
It's like Baghdad.

561
00:28:20,125 --> 00:28:22,333
The bosses stay high
from morning till night.

562
00:28:22,416 --> 00:28:24,833
They'll kill anyone to protect their turf.

563
00:28:24,916 --> 00:28:26,375
They're the law now.

564
00:28:26,458 --> 00:28:29,416
There are no more cops or politicians,
that's all that's left.

565
00:28:30,166 --> 00:28:33,458
For Eid celebrations, they take
the kids out and give them money.

566
00:28:34,041 --> 00:28:36,041
Other than that, they're heartless.

567
00:28:36,125 --> 00:28:38,500
They even fight amongst themselves
to control the network.

568
00:28:38,583 --> 00:28:41,958
As soon as a dealer keeps
a stick for himself, it rains bullets.

569
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,458
-There are no more rules. It's a jungle.
-[whimpering]

570
00:28:48,583 --> 00:28:51,625
[Amel] I'm telling you,
the whole neighborhood's gone crazy.

571
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:58,291
Amel… two kilos is your cut of the haul.

572
00:28:58,375 --> 00:29:00,625
I don't want two kilos from there.
What will I do with it?

573
00:29:00,708 --> 00:29:03,083
-Why?
-You know why? Have you seen this?

574
00:29:03,166 --> 00:29:04,250
Here, smell.

575
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,541
That smell,
they're the only ones who make it.

576
00:29:11,041 --> 00:29:13,458
They're the only ones
who know what to put in it.

577
00:29:13,541 --> 00:29:15,083
It's one-of-a-kind hash.

578
00:29:15,916 --> 00:29:18,083
That's why
I can't take anything from there.

579
00:29:34,541 --> 00:29:35,541
Five kilos.

580
00:29:37,375 --> 00:29:40,250
Get me five kilos from somewhere else,
I'll get you what you need.

581
00:29:42,041 --> 00:29:42,875
[Jérôme] Impossible.

582
00:29:43,833 --> 00:29:46,291
No, it's… That's out of the question.

583
00:29:46,375 --> 00:29:49,833
Really? Who gives a fuck?
Those drugs are gonna be destroyed anyway.

584
00:29:49,916 --> 00:29:53,416
We don't take drugs off of the streets
to put them back there. How can you ask?

585
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:56,125
Oh, here we go.
Are you saying this is a moral issue?

586
00:29:56,208 --> 00:29:57,625
Taking drugs from the evidence room

587
00:29:57,708 --> 00:30:00,833
could cause other convictions
to get tossed. You know I can't.

588
00:30:00,916 --> 00:30:03,958
-We can't give the informant the haul.
-[Jérôme] You have to.

589
00:30:04,458 --> 00:30:06,791
Won't work.
Using their hash is a non-starter.

590
00:30:06,875 --> 00:30:07,875
What do we do?

591
00:30:07,958 --> 00:30:10,166
Just do it. Figure it out.
I don't want to know.

592
00:30:10,250 --> 00:30:11,083
What does that mean?

593
00:30:11,166 --> 00:30:14,208
It means that you find drugs
that aren't under seal or something.

594
00:30:14,291 --> 00:30:16,875
So we take all the risks
and you hide behind your desk?

595
00:30:16,958 --> 00:30:19,000
-Whoa!
-[Jérôme] Those are the prefect's orders.

596
00:30:19,083 --> 00:30:22,125
They want a police response.
My job is to give them a police response.

597
00:30:22,208 --> 00:30:25,041
-Does that work for you?
-Give us access to the drugs under seal.

598
00:30:25,125 --> 00:30:27,750
Why should I risk my career
if we aren't given what we need?

599
00:30:27,833 --> 00:30:29,750
Fuck this.
Nobody gives a shit about the ghettos.

600
00:30:29,833 --> 00:30:32,375
The prefect just wants positive press
in the front page.

601
00:30:32,458 --> 00:30:34,250
[Jérôme] That's not true. You're wrong.

602
00:30:37,125 --> 00:30:38,708
So, then what's in it for us?

603
00:30:38,791 --> 00:30:39,625
Raises.

604
00:30:41,916 --> 00:30:43,541
-[Yass] How much?
-I don't know.

605
00:30:43,625 --> 00:30:45,583
One, possibly two.

606
00:30:45,666 --> 00:30:47,166
[chuckles] Are you serious?

607
00:30:47,250 --> 00:30:49,958
We're gonna do this for 50,
100 euros tops per month?

608
00:30:50,041 --> 00:30:52,000
-And we're risking the blame?
-[Jérôme] What blame?

609
00:30:52,083 --> 00:30:54,791
Worried a sanction could keep you
from taking your officer exam?

610
00:30:54,875 --> 00:30:56,416
-It looks bad.
-[Jérôme] So what?

611
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:58,000
You want to become an officer?

612
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,125
Do this operation.

613
00:31:02,291 --> 00:31:03,750
[Greg] Yeah. OK, we got it.

614
00:31:05,791 --> 00:31:06,791
Yeah.

615
00:31:07,375 --> 00:31:08,625
So, figure it out?

616
00:31:08,708 --> 00:31:09,708
That's right.

01:07:05,166 --> 01:07:06,166
[Yass] Yeah.

1161
01:07:11,875 --> 01:07:12,750
Come on!

1162
01:07:13,833 --> 01:07:14,875
I'm tired.

1163
01:07:16,250 --> 01:07:17,291
But I'm happy!

1164
01:07:24,708 --> 01:07:26,083
[exhales sharply]

1165
01:07:30,041 --> 01:07:31,000
'Sup?

1166
01:07:32,833 --> 01:07:33,833
Let's see…

1167
01:07:35,333 --> 01:07:36,375
Boom!

1168
01:07:38,916 --> 01:07:40,166
[chuckles]

1169
01:07:40,250 --> 01:07:41,291
[Antoine] All good?

1170
01:07:42,333 --> 01:07:43,416
Put it in your trunk?

1171
01:07:56,583 --> 01:07:57,666
[Antoine sighs]

1172
01:07:58,208 --> 01:07:59,125
So it is.

1173
01:08:01,291 --> 01:08:02,666
What are you gonna do?

1174
01:08:03,166 --> 01:08:06,250
-I'll probably smoke it all myself.
-[both laugh]

1175
01:08:08,458 --> 01:08:09,833
Another life, I'd join you.

1176
01:08:14,333 --> 01:08:16,250
So this is the end of the road.

1177
01:08:17,625 --> 01:08:18,833
This is it, yeah.

1178
01:08:20,583 --> 01:08:23,208
-So you're finally getting rid of me.
-[both chuckle]

1179
01:08:27,041 --> 01:08:29,000
All right. [slaps Amel's hand]

1180
01:08:30,833 --> 01:08:32,166
Take care of yourself.

1181
01:08:35,708 --> 01:08:36,625
Hey…

1182
01:08:38,583 --> 01:08:39,791
See you around, Amel.

1183
01:08:42,958 --> 01:08:43,916
[sighs]

1184
01:08:45,666 --> 01:08:46,750
Hey, Antoine…

1185
01:08:48,208 --> 01:08:49,041
What?

1186
01:08:50,208 --> 01:08:51,958
-Never mind, it's fine.
-What?

1187
01:08:52,041 --> 01:08:53,958
Nothing, it's fine. Get outta here.

1188
01:08:54,041 --> 01:08:56,750
[both chuckle]

1189
01:08:56,833 --> 01:08:59,375
Don't get fresh
or you'll end up in the water!

1190
01:09:01,250 --> 01:09:02,875
-[Amel chuckles]
-[engine starts]

1191
01:09:06,375 --> 01:09:08,916
-[Amel chuckles]
-Go on. Get out of here.

1192
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:23,708
[sighs, chuckles]

1193

[baby laughs]

1197
01:09:43,416 --> 01:09:44,916
Hey, bubba. [chuckles]

1198
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:47,166
Who's my little buddy? You my buddy?

1199
01:09:47,250 --> 01:09:48,375
We're buddies, right?

1200
01:10:02,958 --> 01:10:04,541
-[man] Sergeant Cerva?
-Yes.

1201
01:10:05,208 --> 01:10:06,458
[man] Lieutenant Vidal.

[police dog barks]

1204
01:10:26,458 --> 01:10:27,625
[Nora] What's going on?

1205
01:10:28,291 --> 01:10:29,125
Yass?

1206
01:10:30,666 --> 01:10:32,250
-Where's the baby?
-Inside.

1207
01:10:32,916 --> 01:10:34,416
I'll call you when I'm done.

1208
01:10:38,041 --> 01:10:40,250
What the hell is this mess?
Are you kidding?

1209
01:10:40,333 --> 01:10:42,416
-You don't have to do this! Why?
-Hey, calm down.

1210
01:10:42,500 --> 01:10:44,375
-Where's my son?
-[officer] Take it down a notch.

1211
01:10:44,458 --> 01:10:47,958
Everything's fine. He's in the bedroom.
We need to check the cupboards.

1212
01:10:50,708 --> 01:10:52,375
Emilien, check under the TV.

1213
01:10:53,750 --> 01:10:54,583
Shit!

1214
01:10:57,416 --> 01:10:59,083
Come, my love. Huh?

1215
01:10:59,166 --> 01:11:00,625
-He's fine.
-Are you OK?

1216
01:11:01,416 --> 01:11:02,458
Please leave.

1217
01:11:04,583 --> 01:11:06,291
Are you OK, my love? Huh?

1218
01:11:06,375 --> 01:11:08,458
-[officer] Go along the closets.
-Sweetie.

1219
01:11:08,541 --> 01:11:09,875
-[baby gurgles]
-Hey.

1220
01:11:09,958 --> 01:11:11,125
Mommy's here now.

1221
01:11:15,416 --> 01:11:16,791
[car engine starts]

1222

-[car tires crunch gravel]
-[siren wails]

1223
01:11:28,375 --> 01:11:30,166
[man] I have to inform you
that this interview

1224
01:11:30,250 --> 01:11:33,375
will be recorded on video
for further use in the investigation.

1225
01:11:33,458 --> 01:11:36,875
Let me introduce myself.
I'm Lieutenant Yvon. IGPN.

1226
01:11:36,958 --> 01:11:39,666
Great. What the hell am I doing here?
I'd like to know.

1227
01:11:40,583 --> 01:11:42,041
Well, the charges are…

1228
01:11:44,666 --> 01:11:45,500
…racketeering…

1229
01:11:47,625 --> 01:11:49,083
…and organized drug trafficking.

1230
01:11:49,166 --> 01:11:50,083
[scoffs]

1231
01:11:50,708 --> 01:11:51,791
[sighs]

1232
01:11:53,166 --> 01:11:57,250
-Are you kidding? Is this a joke?
-[Yvon] No, I don't think it's a joke.

1233
01:11:57,750 --> 01:12:00,791
Well? The cannabis,
who did you steal it from?

1234
01:12:00,875 --> 01:12:02,000
We didn't steal it.

1235
01:12:02,750 --> 01:12:04,500
-[Yvon] You didn't steal it?
-No.

1236
01:12:04,583 --> 01:12:06,458
-We collected it.
-"Collected"?

1237
01:12:08,708 --> 01:12:11,583
That's a nice way of putting it.
I like it. "Collected."

1238
01:12:14,541 --> 01:12:16,000
Police exhibit number four.

1239
01:12:18,125 --> 01:12:19,958
Kept a few sticks of cannabis
for yourself,

1240
01:12:20,041 --> 01:12:22,375
which we found in your home, to get high?

1241
01:12:22,458 --> 01:12:23,583
[Antoine snickers]

1242
01:12:23,666 --> 01:12:25,291
I smoke cannabis, yes.

1243
01:12:25,916 --> 01:12:28,125
So, this is for your personal consumption?

1244
01:12:28,208 --> 01:12:29,333
I just said so.

1245
01:12:30,750 --> 01:12:31,708
Didn't you hear me?

1246
01:12:31,791 --> 01:12:34,541
And, uh, how do you explain the presence

1247
01:12:35,166 --> 01:12:36,291
of this scale?

1248
01:12:38,291 --> 01:12:42,541
Do you know a lot of potheads
who weigh their dope? I don't know any.

1249
01:12:43,916 --> 01:12:45,166
Only dealers do that.

1250
01:12:45,958 --> 01:12:47,375
We never sold any drugs.

1251
01:12:48,375 --> 01:12:50,458
-Never.
-[Yvon] You didn't sell any drugs.

1252
01:12:50,541 --> 01:12:53,375
No. Drugs were our bargaining chip.
Drugs in exchange for information.

1253
01:12:53,458 --> 01:12:55,416
-That's not what people are saying.
-Oh?

1254
01:12:56,166 --> 01:12:58,041
Please tell me what people are saying.

1255
01:12:58,125 --> 01:13:01,500
They say you confiscate drugs
then turn around and sell them.

1256
01:13:03,375 --> 01:13:05,625
The drugs were used

1257
01:13:05,708 --> 01:13:10,083
to pay the informant who told us
about the distributing apartment.

1258
01:13:10,166 --> 01:13:13,125
An informant whose identity
is completely unknown to you.

1259
01:13:13,208 --> 01:13:14,250
Only Antoine knows.

1260
01:13:14,333 --> 01:13:17,875
The informant wanted to remain anonymous.
It's what they do. But you know that.

1261
01:13:17,958 --> 01:13:19,041
[Yvon] Of course.

1262
01:13:19,125 --> 01:13:20,375
I'm not telling you shit.

1263
01:13:20,958 --> 01:13:23,500
-Zero.
-And for what reason are you refusing?

1264
01:13:23,583 --> 01:13:24,666
You can't be serious?

1265
01:13:24,750 --> 01:13:26,833
If I give you my informant,
that puts them at risk.

1266
01:13:27,916 --> 01:13:30,833
-I promised to keep them anonymous.
-[Yvon] Yes, of course.

1267
01:13:30,916 --> 01:13:33,583
You gave your word so you're keeping it.
You're not a snitch.

1268
01:13:33,666 --> 01:13:35,375
-Is that it?
-Exactly, that's it.

1269
01:13:36,333 --> 01:13:37,583
That's how thugs operate.

1270
01:13:39,375 --> 01:13:40,583
Go fuck yourself.

1271
01:13:41,166 --> 01:13:43,208
I didn't catch the informant's name.

1272
01:13:43,291 --> 01:13:46,125
I'm not telling you anything.
There are ethics to being a cop.

1273
01:13:46,208 --> 01:13:48,708
-[Yvon] Oh.
-You don't look like you have any. Huh?

1274
01:13:50,583 --> 01:13:52,458
Trying to take down your colleagues.

1275
01:13:52,541 --> 01:13:53,625
You have a child?

1276
01:13:54,875 --> 01:13:57,291
-Yeah.
-[Yvon] Some things are understandable.

1277
01:13:57,375 --> 01:14:00,166
When you have a kid, 1,800 euros a month…

1278
01:14:00,250 --> 01:14:03,208
-Risking your life every day.
-What are you trying to say?

1279
01:14:03,291 --> 01:14:05,375
I think that the drugs,

1280
01:14:05,458 --> 01:14:08,208
you sold them because you need help
making ends meet.

1281
01:14:08,291 --> 01:14:10,208
Quit talking out of your ass
with your bullshit!

1282
01:14:10,291 --> 01:14:13,125
Why are you bringing my son into this
with that shitty condescending tone?

1283
01:14:13,208 --> 01:14:15,625
-You need help making ends meet--
-Think you're better than me?

1284
01:14:15,708 --> 01:14:18,500
-Anyone could understand.
-You think you're better?

1285
01:14:20,958 --> 01:14:23,125
-You think I'm dirty, don't you?
-[Yvon] No.

1286
01:14:23,208 --> 01:14:25,958
If you want me not to think that,
you have to give me something.

1287
01:14:26,458 --> 01:14:28,666
Quit looking at me like that. OK?

1288
01:14:29,333 --> 01:14:31,166
You quit looking at me like that.

1289
01:14:31,250 --> 01:14:33,333
-I've been doing this job 20 years.
-Yeah?

1290
01:14:33,416 --> 01:14:35,750
OK? Think you're
on the right side of the desk?

1291
01:14:35,833 --> 01:14:38,041
You think you know everything,
but you don't!

1292
01:14:38,125 --> 01:14:39,833
-I'm doing my job.
-You don't know anything!

1293
01:14:39,916 --> 01:14:42,750
You don't know what we went through,
don't know the northern sector!

1294
01:14:42,833 --> 01:14:45,916
You've never set foot there!
You're just a fucking bureaucrat!

1295
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:48,125
-You should--
-We almost died out there!

1296
01:14:48,208 --> 01:14:50,166
-You should calm down.
-Seen the poverty out there?

1297
01:14:50,250 --> 01:14:52,291
You ain't seen nothing!
Get down from that high horse.

1298
01:14:52,375 --> 01:14:54,791
-I'm giving you a piece of advice.
-Don't take that tone. Fuck.

1299
01:14:54,875 --> 01:14:56,708
-I'm giving you… Calm down!
-Shut up!

1300
01:14:56,791 --> 01:14:57,875
-Shut your mouth!
-Calm down.

1301
01:14:57,958 --> 01:15:01,625
-I ask the questions, you answer them!
-I'm done talking to you! I'm done!

1302
01:15:01,708 --> 01:15:04,541
-Then who will you talk to?
-You want to lock me up, huh?

1303
01:15:04,625 --> 01:15:07,041
That way you can meet your quota,
you puny little man!

1304
01:15:07,125 --> 01:15:11,375
I know this story by heart. I know it by
heart! You wanna meet your quota!

1305
01:15:11,458 --> 01:15:14,458
-There! I'm done talking to you.
-Calm down! Calm down.

1306
01:15:14,541 --> 01:15:17,291
-It's pointless. You're just an asshole!
-It's in your best interest.

1307
01:15:17,375 --> 01:15:19,916
Go fuck yourself!
Now I wanna talk to my superior.

1308
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:22,916
I wanna talk to Jérôme!
I'm not saying another word!

1309
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:26,375
You're not talking to anyone!
We already talked to your superior.

1310
01:15:26,458 --> 01:15:29,166
Know what? Jérôme doesn't know
anything about your informant!

1311
01:15:29,250 --> 01:15:30,875
-You made it up!
-Oh, he doesn't?

1312
01:15:30,958 --> 01:15:34,041
Hey, moron. You imbecile!
My superior is my friend!

1313
01:15:34,125 --> 01:15:36,750
We did this mission together!
He gave the order!

1314
01:15:36,833 --> 01:15:38,208
-Oh, right!
-You're fucked!

1315
01:15:38,291 --> 01:15:39,500
You are fucked!

1316
01:15:39,583 --> 01:15:41,916
-You should be careful with your friends.
-I'm done talking!

1317
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:45,000
I want an audience
with the prosecutor's office, and Jérôme!

1318
01:15:45,083 --> 01:15:46,000
Keep going.

1319
01:15:46,083 --> 01:15:49,125
I'm done talking to you!
I'm done talking! Go fuck yourself!

1320
01:15:49,208 --> 01:15:50,625
-You better control yourself!
-Hey!

1321
01:15:50,708 --> 01:15:53,416
-[Yvon] Take care of him.
-You should be ashamed!

1322
01:15:53,500 --> 01:15:55,875
-[officer] Cuff him.
-You don't know? You know what we did?

1323
01:15:55,958 --> 01:15:57,791
[Yvon] You're nothing now! Nothing!

1324

1325
01:16:27,833 --> 01:16:29,208
[woman] Please have a seat.

1326
01:16:30,041 --> 01:16:31,291
[Greg] Hello, Your Honor.

1327
01:16:32,125 --> 01:16:33,083
[judge] So…

1328
01:16:34,041 --> 01:16:37,500
We're here at the request of the accused,
Grégory Cerva.

1329
01:16:37,583 --> 01:16:41,000
He asked to be heard in your presence,
Mr. Jérôme Bodin,

1330
01:16:41,083 --> 01:16:44,041
head of the anti-criminal brigade
of the northern sector.

1331
01:16:45,583 --> 01:16:49,166
Mr. Bodin, while exercising
your duties as an officer,

1332
01:16:49,250 --> 01:16:53,291
were you aware of an operation
being carried out at night by this team,

1333
01:16:53,375 --> 01:16:56,375
in order to collect
various amounts of cannabis hash?

1334
01:16:57,166 --> 01:16:58,291
No, I was not aware.

1335
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:03,000
I'll remind you that you are under oath.

1336
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:06,458
-Do you confirm?
-I confirm.

1337
01:17:06,541 --> 01:17:08,708
-Jérôme, what are you doing?
-No, Mr. Cerva.

1338
01:17:08,791 --> 01:17:11,333
-What are you doing?
-[judge] Mr. Cerva! Mr. Cerva!

1339
01:17:12,666 --> 01:17:14,625
You'll be able
to have your say in due time.

1340
01:17:14,708 --> 01:17:16,708
I'll remind you that you are under oath.

1341
01:17:19,083 --> 01:17:20,958
-Do you confirm?
-I confirm.

1342
01:17:22,708 --> 01:17:25,333
[judge] You never heard
about this collecting of drugs?

1343
01:17:25,416 --> 01:17:26,375
Never.

1344
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:29,500
[judge] Is it possible
that without your knowledge,

1345
01:17:29,583 --> 01:17:32,583
this collecting was used
to pay an informant for information

1346
01:17:32,666 --> 01:17:35,416
used in the operation
that led to the dismantling

1347
01:17:35,500 --> 01:17:37,875
of the drug trafficking network
in question?

1348
01:17:38,791 --> 01:17:40,166
It's… It's possible.

1349
01:17:43,333 --> 01:17:44,833
But I was not aware of it.

1350
01:17:47,541 --> 01:17:48,666
[judge] Mr. Cerva,

1351
01:17:48,750 --> 01:17:51,916
you claim that your chain of command
was aware of your actions?

1352
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:53,166
Absolutely. [sniffs]

1353
01:17:54,250 --> 01:17:58,583
[judge] You claim that your superior,
present here, had approved your actions?

1354
01:17:58,666 --> 01:17:59,500
Yes.

1355
01:18:01,083 --> 01:18:03,333
[judge] Careful now,
is this a direct accusation?

1356
01:18:03,416 --> 01:18:04,250
Yes.

1357
01:18:05,541 --> 01:18:08,000
[judge] Do you have
any evidence to present to me?

1358
01:18:10,458 --> 01:18:11,291
No.

1359
01:18:13,041 --> 01:18:13,875
No.

1360
01:18:13,958 --> 01:18:15,375
[sniffles]

1361
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:17,625
[Greg taps feet]

1362
01:18:19,083 --> 01:18:22,416
[judge] Thank you, gentlemen.
Mr. Bodin, you may leave.

1363
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:23,958
Thank you.

1364
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:29,500

[keys jangle]

1366
01:18:34,125 --> 01:18:37,625
[guard] You'll be in solitary confinement
during your provisional detention.

1367
01:18:37,708 --> 01:18:40,291
-Until the investigation's over.
-[gate locks]

1368
01:18:40,375 --> 01:18:43,333
[guard] You can call your family
in one month. Not before.

1369
01:18:44,041 --> 01:18:45,875
No contact with other inmates.

1370
01:18:45,958 --> 01:18:47,333
It's for your own safety.

1371
01:18:48,083 --> 01:18:50,083
You don't have a lot of friends in here.

1372
01:18:52,541 --> 01:18:54,791
[inmates yelling indistinctly in distance]

1373
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:58,291

We'll get you, scumbag!

[inmate 6] Fucking crook!

1380
01:19:20,708 --> 01:19:23,333
The only person
you'll communicate with is the guard.

1381
01:19:23,416 --> 01:19:25,375
The only way to call him is this.

1382
01:19:26,375 --> 01:19:28,291
[inmate 7] We're gonna come for you!

Hello. Yes. It's just that…

01:19:53,666 --> 01:19:56,958
-[guard] What do you want?
-It's just that I need to see you now.

1389
01:19:57,041 --> 01:19:59,500
[guard] Not now.
We'll deal with it tomorrow.

1390
01:19:59,583 --> 01:20:01,750
No, it's just
that I need to talk to my captain.

[TV news jingle plays]

1396
01:20:39,041 --> 01:20:42,958
Good evening. In tonight's headlines,
a scandal with the Marseille police.

1397
01:20:43,041 --> 01:20:46,250
Three BAC employees are suspected
of corruption and extortion.

1398
01:20:46,333 --> 01:20:48,958
They allegedly sold drugs
that had been recovered from thugs

1399
01:20:49,041 --> 01:20:50,291
in exchange for services.

1400
01:20:50,375 --> 01:20:51,791
For several months now,

1401
01:20:51,875 --> 01:20:54,208
investigators had installed microphones
in their vehicles.

1402
01:20:54,291 --> 01:20:57,208
The recorded conversations
don't leave much room for doubt,

1403
01:20:57,291 --> 01:20:58,666
according to the prosecutor.

1404
01:20:58,750 --> 01:21:01,916
[prosecutor] This is the unit in charge
of recovering drugs from dealers

1405
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:04,583
and counterfeit cigarettes
from street vendors.

1406
01:21:04,666 --> 01:21:08,750
I will be, as I have had the opportunity
to be in other situations,

1407
01:21:08,833 --> 01:21:12,208
extremely strict regarding these men.

1408
01:21:12,291 --> 01:21:15,458
There is no room
for those who defile the police

1409
01:21:16,291 --> 01:21:17,541
and the Republic.

1410
01:21:17,625 --> 01:21:21,000
Everyone must know
that we will take the strictest…

1411
01:21:21,083 --> 01:21:21,916
Guard!

1412
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:23,291
…possible measures.

1413
01:21:25,041 --> 01:21:28,416
[reporter] Every time the north BAC
is involved in a procedure, in a case,

1414
01:21:28,500 --> 01:21:30,250
there will be an underlying doubt,

1415
01:21:30,333 --> 01:21:32,666
according to many lawyers
of the Marseille bar.

1416
01:21:32,750 --> 01:21:36,375
And these lawyers are not excluding
requesting release for clients

1417
01:21:36,458 --> 01:21:37,625
who had been brought in

1418
01:21:37,708 --> 01:21:41,916
by these north BAC policemen at the time,
and who are currently incarcerated.

1419

[reporter 2] Today,

1420
01:21:44,458 --> 01:21:48,125
I sense great distress
amongst the population.

1421
01:21:49,125 --> 01:21:52,333
Minister, do you have a plan
for placing this type of unit

1422
01:21:52,416 --> 01:21:55,583
under stricter
and more efficient surveillance?

1423
01:21:57,625 --> 01:21:59,416
Having to directly fight thugs

1424
01:21:59,500 --> 01:22:01,625
requires that much more restraint

1425
01:22:01,708 --> 01:22:04,291
and a sense of republican values.

1426
01:22:04,375 --> 01:22:06,791
And a police officer
who doesn't respect the law

1427
01:22:06,875 --> 01:22:09,000
and the code of ethics of the police

1428
01:22:09,083 --> 01:22:12,000
defiles the uniform and has no place
in Marseille's police…

1429
01:22:12,083 --> 01:22:13,166
Answer me!

1430
01:22:14,125 --> 01:22:16,625
Hey! Answer me!

01:22:16,708 --> 01:22:18,000
Answer me!

1432
01:22:18,083 --> 01:22:19,750
Dammit, answer me!

1433
01:22:20,250 --> 01:22:22,500
-Hey! Hey! [grunts]
-[man on TV] Thank you.

1434
01:22:22,583 --> 01:22:25,458
-That's a form of corruption.
-Hey! Answer me!

1435
01:22:25,541 --> 01:22:29,208
Most concerning is civil servants seem
to have lost their moral standards.

1436
01:22:29,291 --> 01:22:30,125
[sobs]

1437
01:22:30,208 --> 01:22:33,625
[reporter 3] The justice department
speaks of a broad criminal investigation

1438
01:22:33,708 --> 01:22:36,833
that's only just getting started.
If the facts are confirmed,

1439
01:22:36,916 --> 01:22:40,458
the police officers could be sentenced
to up to 20 years in prison.

1440
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:42,708
-[man] You all right?
-[Antoine] Yeah.

1441
01:22:42,791 --> 01:22:45,125
Your family gives you money
for the commissary?

1442
01:22:45,208 --> 01:22:46,291
-Yeah, I'm fine.
-OK.

1443
01:22:46,833 --> 01:22:49,833
Listen, I know I'm your lawyer,
but I'm not a miracle worker.

1444
01:22:50,333 --> 01:22:51,875
So far, our defense is frail.

1445
01:22:51,958 --> 01:22:53,291
We don't have much.

1446
01:22:53,375 --> 01:22:56,916
Your problem is that everyone's
gotten involved with this business.

1447
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:59,083
The prefect, the mayor,

1448
01:22:59,166 --> 01:23:01,166
the reporters and the minister too.

1449
01:23:01,875 --> 01:23:03,708
You hear the minister the other day?

1450
01:23:04,208 --> 01:23:06,791
If there's to be a chance
of getting you outta here,

1451
01:23:08,291 --> 01:23:10,208
I need the name of that informant.

1452
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:20,333
No, I can't do that.

1453
01:23:21,125 --> 01:23:22,041
Think about it.

1454
01:23:24,333 --> 01:23:25,375
I can't do that.

Ah, my hand really hurts.
I can't even move it.

-Not now. You were there this morning.

01:23:54,125 --> 01:23:57,625
OK. Um, do you know
if my lawyer spoke with my superior?

-They were meant to meet this morning.
-You're not the only one here.

1463

You know I got no business being in here.

-Stop. I don't need…

[Jacques] Yeah, of course. Tell us.

1497

You guys collected drugs too.

1498

You need to say something,
tell Internal Affairs.

It can change this.
It'll give some weight to their version.

1500

It won't, Nora. It's just gonna put
the three of us in the slammer with them.

They said nothing. Even Greg.

those nights--

1506
