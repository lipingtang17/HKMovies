INSPIRED BY A TRUE STORY,

00:00:08,208 --> 00:00:10,000
CHARACTERS AND EVENTS ARE FICTIONAL.

NETFLIX PRESENTS

00:00:56,833 --> 00:00:59,083
Last name, first name,

00:00:59,166 --> 00:01:01,250
Grégory Cerva. C-E-R-V-A.

6
00:01:01,333 --> 00:01:02,541
September 4, 1976.

7
00:01:02,625 --> 00:01:04,583
-Any family?
-No.

8
00:01:07,333 --> 00:01:08,708
Give me your left hand.

9
00:01:12,958 --> 00:01:14,125
All four fingers.

10
00:01:17,166 --> 00:01:18,958
Over there, back against the wall.

11
00:01:37,208 --> 00:01:39,500
TN13, BAC 26. Officers in pursuit.

12
00:01:39,583 --> 00:01:41,916
We're in Corbière
chasing a stolen scooter with no plates.

13
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:42,833
8 MONTHS EARLIER

14
00:01:42,916 --> 00:01:43,791
The make is a Yamaha.

15
00:01:43,875 --> 00:01:46,458
The suspect isn't wearing a helmet
and refuses to pull over.

16
00:01:46,541 --> 00:01:48,875
Continue the pursuit.
Describe progress.

17
00:01:48,958 --> 00:01:50,083
Pull over!

18
00:01:50,166 --> 00:01:52,458
The suspect is going uphill!

19
00:01:52,541 --> 00:01:55,125
He's still refusing to pull over!
Still refusing!

20
00:01:55,208 --> 00:01:57,583
-Speed up, Greg.
-I know. I'm trying.

21
00:01:57,666 --> 00:02:00,708
Stay on him! Stay on him!
Fuck, speed up!

22
00:02:00,791 --> 00:02:03,041
-Hey, hey!
-Hey! Pull over!

23
00:02:03,125 --> 00:02:06,583
-Pull over and we'll talk!
-He still refuses to pull over.

24
00:02:06,666 --> 00:02:09,416
Officers in pursuit.
I repeat, officers in pursuit.

25
00:02:19,083 --> 00:02:20,458
Shit! Fuck!

26
00:02:30,125 --> 00:02:30,958
Stop!

27
00:02:38,291 --> 00:02:39,125
Hey!

28
00:02:41,083 --> 00:02:41,916
Shit!

29
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:48,916
-Can't believe I didn't catch this junk.
-Didn't run fast enough, man.

30
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,208
You run like my grandmother.
If it'd been me…

31
00:02:51,875 --> 00:02:52,958
"Me"? Where were you?

32
00:02:53,041 --> 00:02:55,791
Behind your slow ass.
If I'd run ahead, he'd be in cuffs.

33
00:02:55,875 --> 00:02:57,875
-If you ran ahead. Sorry.
-Yeah, right.

34
00:02:57,958 --> 00:02:59,375
I was in front, so I let you pass.

35
00:02:59,458 --> 00:03:02,791
What are you laughing at, huh?
You just stayed in the car, asshole.

36
00:03:04,416 --> 00:03:07,458
We'll have to do two hours of paperwork
over a piece of shit stolen scooter.

37
00:03:07,541 --> 00:03:08,958
It doesn't even have plates!

38
00:03:10,375 --> 00:03:11,875
We're not doing this today.

39
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:15,916
-No.
-What?

40
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,916
-Forget it.
-What? Forget what? I didn't say anything.

41
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,250
-But you're going to.
-Come on. Shall we get stupid?

42
00:03:21,333 --> 00:03:22,625
-Here we go.
-I'll call.

43
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:33,666
-Yeah, it's me.
-Let me call back in five.

44
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:35,125
-Wait.
-What do you want?

45
00:03:35,208 --> 00:03:39,083
I need some quick info. Know what block
your neighborhood dealer's on today?

46
00:03:39,166 --> 00:03:42,708
No one's selling around my place today.
Go to Félix Pyat. The dealer's in Block C.

47
00:03:42,791 --> 00:03:43,666
All right.

48
00:03:44,291 --> 00:03:46,041
Good stuff. Go ahead. I'll follow.

49
00:03:47,125 --> 00:03:48,375
-Giddy up.
-Let's do this.

50
00:03:50,416 --> 00:03:52,125
-Let's go the back way!
-Hear hear.

51
00:04:03,625 --> 00:04:06,208
We're coming up on the lookout.

52
00:04:17,125 --> 00:04:18,416
Looking for that fire.

53
00:04:18,916 --> 00:04:20,041
Slide on in.

54
00:04:25,708 --> 00:04:26,708
We're in.

55
00:04:31,083 --> 00:04:32,583
We're coming up on the block.

56
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:34,500
Yeah. Not yet.

57
00:04:38,916 --> 00:04:40,166
Got eyes on the dealer.

58
00:04:49,583 --> 00:04:51,666
-All right, Greg. Head our way.
-Copy.

59
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:03,375
Got a 20 sack, please?

60
00:05:04,291 --> 00:05:06,208
Police!

61
00:05:09,791 --> 00:05:11,833
5-0!

62
00:05:11,916 --> 00:05:13,666
Let go, you little bitch!

63
00:05:19,291 --> 00:05:21,208
Go, go! Come on, Greg, we got him!

64
00:05:29,958 --> 00:05:32,166
-Let's go. Move, move!
-Let me go, motherfucker!

65
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:35,458
Faster!

66
00:05:37,416 --> 00:05:39,250
-I ain't got shit!
-What is that?

67
00:05:39,333 --> 00:05:40,833
-That's not mine!
-What's that?

68
00:05:40,916 --> 00:05:41,875
Fuck!

69
00:05:46,333 --> 00:05:48,833
Motherfucker. This might hurt a bit.

70
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:51,000
We got this. Faster!

71
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:01,583
Here.

72
00:07:04,458 --> 00:07:05,833
Hey! Only five?

73
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:09,791
What do you mean, only five?
That was the deal.

74
00:07:09,875 --> 00:07:13,208
The dealer from Félix Pyat,
that was a big deal, right?

75
00:07:15,541 --> 00:07:18,083
-Yeah, it was a big deal.
-So break me off here, please.

76
00:07:18,166 --> 00:07:20,708
-I'm trying to get paid over here.
-Why you trying to play me?

77
00:07:22,416 --> 00:07:23,958
Aah!

78
00:07:25,625 --> 00:07:27,875
Nah, I'm serious.
The price for fire is high out there.

79
00:07:27,958 --> 00:07:29,250
-Ah, yeah?
-It's true.

80
00:07:29,333 --> 00:07:31,416
-Your government's breaking our balls.
-Gimme a hit.

81
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,375
Come on. Like they don't know
who's buying all that hash?

82
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,125
Your face. Turn.

83
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:39,875
Looks like you got rocked.

84
00:07:43,958 --> 00:07:46,750
-I took a punch, yeah.
-Yeah, you got hit with a brick.

85
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:51,583
-You should've seen the other guy.
-Oh, you're such a pussy.

86
00:07:53,916 --> 00:07:56,166
-Amel.
-Fuck around, and fall in that water.

87
00:07:57,041 --> 00:07:58,208
I'm the one going in?

88
00:07:58,291 --> 00:08:01,291
-Stop! Stop! Quit playing!
-Ooh! Don't mess with the bull.

89
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,666
-Wanna get some grub? Your treat.
-Here, smoke. No, your treat.

90
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:08,583
You only gave me five sticks.
So you're buying, big timer.

91
00:08:09,291 --> 00:08:10,166
Put that away.

92
00:08:10,666 --> 00:08:12,458
-Relax. No one's gonna steal it.
-Put it away.

93
00:08:12,541 --> 00:08:15,750
-Can you smoke, please?
-What if someone walks by? Put that away.

94
00:08:27,125 --> 00:08:28,250
How's it going?

95
00:08:30,125 --> 00:08:31,916
What the hell are you doing here?

96
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:34,625
You didn't do nothing, right?

97
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,000
Hey. What's up, man?

98
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:38,791
Yo, brother. What's happening?

99
00:08:40,083 --> 00:08:42,125
-Is this place a zoo today or what?
-Shut your mouth!

100
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:45,166
Thanks, Laurence.

101
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,041
All right.

102
00:08:48,916 --> 00:08:51,916
We can't continue like this. Every time
he sees a vehicle, it turns into a war.

103
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,875
Too much damage, Greg.

104
00:08:53,958 --> 00:08:56,458
Some damage, 200 grams,
and a dealer off the street isn't nothing.

105
00:08:56,541 --> 00:08:59,583
The headlight, a bumper,
a rear fender, that's 3,000 euros!

106
00:08:59,666 --> 00:09:01,916
-That's how we're keeping score?
-Please, Greg. Stop it.

107
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,208
The guys upstairs
are breaking my balls 24/7.

108
00:09:04,291 --> 00:09:07,416
They're up my ass
every time you pull this bullshit. Huh?

109
00:09:09,708 --> 00:09:12,750
Also, you need to stop
hanging around those fucking ghettos.

110
00:09:12,833 --> 00:09:14,541
-Making dealer runs.
-Someone has to.

111
00:09:14,625 --> 00:09:18,375
No one gives a fuck about 100 euros.
You need to get this through your head.

112
00:09:18,458 --> 00:09:22,208
A small-time pickpocket or big-time dealer
hits our numbers just the same.

113
00:09:22,833 --> 00:09:25,416
All they want us to do is meet our quota.
That, and clean arrests.

114
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,416
-Clean arrests.
-Yeah, clean arrests.

115
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,791
Try taking police reports, for example.
That's efficient.

116
00:09:29,875 --> 00:09:33,375
It's never that way with dealers.
They're nothing but a headache. Look…

117
00:09:34,625 --> 00:09:37,208
Drug trafficking,
Félix Pyat, plus one. You see?

118
00:09:37,291 --> 00:09:39,083
Cigarettes, smuggling, plus one.

119
00:09:39,166 --> 00:09:41,000
-Mugging, plus one.
-That's quality?

120
00:09:41,083 --> 00:09:44,375
-That the quality you're talking about?
-It's a fucking plus one.

121
00:09:50,875 --> 00:09:53,958
I repeat, a road accident
at the Grand Littoral store.

122
00:09:54,041 --> 00:09:55,750
In the parking lot, level two.

123
00:09:57,083 --> 00:09:59,083
Um, Car 14, your patrol is over.

124
00:10:00,083 --> 00:10:01,916
Message received. Have a good night.

125
00:10:09,458 --> 00:10:11,291
I went and saw the baby with Nora.

126
00:10:12,333 --> 00:10:13,583
-And?
-Yeah.

127
00:10:14,125 --> 00:10:15,500
It was in 3D. It was weird.

128
00:10:15,583 --> 00:10:17,916
TV13, head for Le Merlan--

129
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,166
I mean, he looked kinda weird.
He looks like a little alien.

130
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:22,625
What you talking about, 3D?

131
00:10:22,708 --> 00:10:25,458
I mean 3D. I don't know.
You can see the baby in 3D.

132
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:26,541
It's super weird.

133
00:10:26,625 --> 00:10:27,916
You get glasses?

134
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,041
-Huh?
-Glasses.

135
00:10:29,125 --> 00:10:30,791
No, idiot. You're such an idiot.

136
00:10:30,875 --> 00:10:32,708
-The image is in 3D.
-You think that?

137
00:10:32,791 --> 00:10:35,833
It lets you see all the… the baby.

138
00:10:35,916 --> 00:10:37,708
Ehh, it's not actually 3D.

139
00:10:37,791 --> 00:10:40,250
No, not like 3D at the movies. It's not--

140
00:10:40,333 --> 00:10:43,291
-Why'd you say it's 3D like the movies?
-Forget it.

141
00:10:44,291 --> 00:10:46,291
-So, no glasses?
-No, no glasses.

142
00:10:46,375 --> 00:10:47,458
OK. That's what's up.

143
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:49,750
-I swear--
-Dickhead.

144
00:10:49,833 --> 00:10:51,083
Does he look like you?

145
00:10:51,583 --> 00:10:53,333
I think he has my eyes.

146
00:10:53,416 --> 00:10:56,583
-As long as he doesn't have your mug.
-I know, right?

147
00:10:56,666 --> 00:10:57,500
Fuck!

148
00:11:08,333 --> 00:11:09,583
-How you living?
-Good, you?

149
00:11:09,666 --> 00:11:12,375
Listen, chief,
that ginger friend of yours,

150
00:11:12,458 --> 00:11:14,083
he straight-up
grabbed my cousin yesterday.

151
00:11:14,166 --> 00:11:16,333
He stripped him,
robbed him, and beat him up.

152
00:11:16,416 --> 00:11:18,875
Not cool. What can I say?
He's an asshole. It is what it is.

153
00:11:18,958 --> 00:11:20,083
Could you talk to him for me?

154
00:11:20,166 --> 00:11:22,375
Sure. Enough of your life story.
Got any intel for me?

155
00:11:22,458 --> 00:11:24,416
No, bro. I swear, I just started my shift.

156
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:26,666
-Look, my bag is full.
-Why do you swear?

157
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:28,333
-So you believe me.
-Nothing going on?

158
00:11:28,416 --> 00:11:31,958
Not right now. If I hear anything,
I'll call you. You know that.

159
00:11:32,041 --> 00:11:35,166
-Look, we're just selling our cigarettes.
-OK.

160
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:38,375
-I only sell cigarettes.
-All right, enough. Give me a carton.

161
00:11:39,125 --> 00:11:40,291
-All you.
-OK.

162
00:11:40,375 --> 00:11:41,541
Have a great day.

163
00:11:58,791 --> 00:12:01,208
That's nothing. Don't worry about it.
Nothing there.

164
00:12:01,291 --> 00:12:02,125
Hmm?

165
00:12:03,291 --> 00:12:05,208
Thank you. Thank you very much.

166
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:06,666
Oh, nice to see you!

167
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:08,666
-How's it going, chief?
-How's the family?

168
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:10,958
-Want three kebabs per usual?
-Yes, sir.

169
00:12:11,041 --> 00:12:13,458
Want extra harissa,
lettuce, tomatoes, onions?

170
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,250
Oh, here we go.

171
00:12:24,333 --> 00:12:26,458
-Check out your boy over there.
-Who?

172
00:12:26,541 --> 00:12:28,958
-The guy by the fruit.
-Which guy by the fruit?

173
00:12:29,041 --> 00:12:31,333
The guy right there
with the hoodie.

174
00:12:31,833 --> 00:12:32,791
Yeah?

175
00:12:32,875 --> 00:12:35,541
Twenty euros
he's gonna grab that old lady's wallet.

176
00:12:35,625 --> 00:12:38,958
No, that guy's too relaxed.
Hands in his pockets, not looking around.

177
00:12:39,041 --> 00:12:40,375
Nah.

178
00:12:40,458 --> 00:12:42,250
-Twenty bucks, you're on.
-Let's go.

179
00:12:43,916 --> 00:12:45,083
Come on, big fella.

180
00:12:46,708 --> 00:12:48,166
She's just a little old lady.

181
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:51,125
-You got this, get busy!
-It's not gonna happen for you.

182
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:57,291
-What's he doing?
-He's holding a melon and smelling it.

183
00:12:57,833 --> 00:12:59,583
Oh no! Goodbye, ma'am.

184
00:12:59,666 --> 00:13:01,125
Oh, weak sauce.

185
00:13:01,625 --> 00:13:04,208
-Hey! Where's my 20?
-I don't have any cash.

186
00:13:04,291 --> 00:13:06,791
You're such a cheapskate.
You never have any money.

187
00:13:06,875 --> 00:13:09,000
You probably spent it all on that haircut.

188
00:13:09,083 --> 00:13:11,333
Ask for your money back. There's lunch!

189
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:13,083
-Ah!
-This is for you.

190
00:13:13,166 --> 00:13:15,000
-You hook it up?
-Got your extra meat.

191
00:13:15,083 --> 00:13:17,250
And samurai sauce. Don't worry, I got you.

192
00:13:19,541 --> 00:13:21,500
-Bon appétit, my friends.
-Mm!

193
00:13:24,875 --> 00:13:28,000
There are turtle vendors over there.
Shall we get them?

194
00:13:28,083 --> 00:13:29,875
-How many are there?
-Two.

195
00:13:29,958 --> 00:13:31,708
That'll get us today's quota.

196
00:13:32,875 --> 00:13:33,708
Hmm?

197
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:35,958
Nah, I don't do turtles.

198
00:13:36,958 --> 00:13:38,166
What does that mean?

199
00:13:39,666 --> 00:13:41,541
What don't you understand?
I don't do turtles.

200
00:13:41,625 --> 00:13:43,916
No, no, no. Wait.
Why don't you do turtles?

201
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,791
-I don't do turtles.
-You wouldn't do turtles?

202
00:13:45,875 --> 00:13:48,333
-I'm not doing turtles.
-You're gonna do turtles.

203
00:13:48,416 --> 00:13:51,541
-We have to go back with something.
-Think of the animals.

204
00:13:51,625 --> 00:13:54,875
-Bro, in my sauce, you serious?
-"I don't do turtles," that's bullshit.

205
00:13:54,958 --> 00:13:57,041
-I don't do turtles.
-Think of the animals.

206
00:14:00,791 --> 00:14:02,291
-Gentlemen.
-Hello, sir.

207
00:14:03,833 --> 00:14:05,708
Who do these turtles belong to?

208
00:14:05,791 --> 00:14:07,208
-They're not ours.
-Not ours.

209
00:14:07,291 --> 00:14:08,416
-Oh yeah?
-Not ours.

210
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:10,666
You know it's illegal to sell these?

211
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:13,291
-Yes, but sir--
-This species is protected.

212
00:14:13,375 --> 00:14:15,250
Illegal, yeah. But they're not ours.

213
00:14:15,333 --> 00:14:18,583
-Stop treating us like fools.
-We told you, they're not ours.

214
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:21,125
-Your pockets.
-What do you mean?

215
00:14:21,208 --> 00:14:23,375
-Empty your pockets.
-Nothing in them. What's the deal?

216
00:14:24,125 --> 00:14:26,500
-Empty them right now.
-Sir, there's nothing in my pockets.

217
00:14:26,583 --> 00:14:28,583
-Hey! What'd you slap him for?
-Empty your pockets.

218
00:14:28,666 --> 00:14:30,583
-Empty them!
-What do you think you're doing?

219
00:14:30,666 --> 00:14:33,333
What's your problem?
Empty your fucking pockets.

220
00:14:33,416 --> 00:14:34,916
-That's not yours?
-Empty them.

221
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,250
-I told you to empty them.
-We're good men.

222
00:14:37,333 --> 00:14:38,333
Pick 'em up!

223
00:14:38,416 --> 00:14:40,958
-What are you doing? It's getting away.
-Pick 'em up.

224
00:14:41,708 --> 00:14:44,000
-Where do you live?
-The 15th.

225
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:46,958
-So, you're from around here?
-Yeah, it's my home.

226
00:14:48,541 --> 00:14:50,208
Oh, these are my colleagues.

227
00:14:52,041 --> 00:14:55,083
-I gotta roll. Nice to meet you.
-They're here for turtles?

228
00:14:55,583 --> 00:14:57,333
Hey, Momo. Do I owe you anything?

229
00:14:57,416 --> 00:14:59,416
-OK, no problem.
-Put her on my tab too.

230
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:02,416
-Whoa, whoa. Big-time collar!
-Shut up. Get in the car.

231
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:04,583
-Stop acting high and mighty.
-What's your problem?

232
00:15:04,666 --> 00:15:08,291
All units in the northern sector,
active car jacking in the 15th.

233
00:15:08,375 --> 00:15:11,208
-A black Audi.
-TN13. BAC 26, we're on it.

234
00:15:11,291 --> 00:15:13,291
Go on, get outta here.

235
00:15:24,833 --> 00:15:26,833
Popo!

236
00:15:27,375 --> 00:15:29,000
Popo!

237
00:15:29,083 --> 00:15:30,250
Fucking hell!

238
00:15:31,291 --> 00:15:33,791
-Shit!
-BAC 26, TN13, abandon pursuit.

239
00:15:33,875 --> 00:15:35,416
Do not enter the ghettos.

240
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:38,125
-These guys are fired up.
-Let's go.

241
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:43,500
What's the problem?

242
00:15:44,166 --> 00:15:45,666
Huh? What are you doing here?

243
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:48,083
We were following a stolen car.
You see it?

244
00:15:48,666 --> 00:15:51,208
-You're the only person I've seen.
-Really? Didn't see anything?

245
00:15:51,291 --> 00:15:52,208
Well, then.

246
00:15:54,208 --> 00:15:56,666
BAC 26, this is TN13.
Respond to my message.

247
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:58,833
Your friend over there must be hot.

248
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:01,416
-Looks like you the one in the heat.
-I'm perfectly comfortable.

249
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:03,916
Do not enter the ghetto.
Abandon pursuit immediately.

250
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,875
Well, then. They're calling you.
You should probably go.

251
00:16:08,583 --> 00:16:09,625
You're the law now?

252
00:16:12,125 --> 00:16:14,875
I'm not the law. Me, I'm a diplomat.

253
00:16:14,958 --> 00:16:18,375
Here to protect you.
But if you wanna go in, go ahead.

254
00:16:19,541 --> 00:16:21,875
-You know what?
-Hey, come on.

255
00:16:21,958 --> 00:16:26,208
They'll probably be into it.
Haven't seen cops for a while. Go for it.

256
00:16:27,916 --> 00:16:30,541
They're inviting you in.
You don't wanna go?

257
00:16:33,583 --> 00:16:37,416
This is TN13, get out immediately.
I repeat, get out immediately.

258
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:39,708
I repeat, get out immediately. I repeat--

259
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:43,125
-Son of a bitch!
-Easy, guys.

260
00:16:43,208 --> 00:16:45,708
-Motherfucker!
-Easy, guys. Nothing to see.

261
00:16:46,416 --> 00:16:48,666
These little bitches just got
a little worked up.

262
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:51,041
About done breaking our balls.

263
00:16:51,125 --> 00:16:53,166
You're about done
breaking our balls, right?

264
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:55,708
You done breaking my balls,
mark-ass bitch?

265
00:16:55,791 --> 00:16:58,000
Shut your mouth
and get the fuck outta here!

266
00:16:58,083 --> 00:16:59,791
You heard me, you little pussy?

267
00:17:01,375 --> 00:17:02,791
You ain't shit without your boys.

268
00:17:02,875 --> 00:17:05,291
Without them, who, what would you be?
Nothing!

269
00:17:05,375 --> 00:17:08,958
Who'd you be without that badge?
Without your boys, you'd be nothing!

270
00:17:09,791 --> 00:17:10,791
Time's up!

271
00:17:12,125 --> 00:17:13,625
Roll out, or come with.

272
00:17:16,416 --> 00:17:18,458
You're not nothing.

273
00:17:18,541 --> 00:17:21,000
Yo, come and get some
or get lost, pig!

274
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:24,666
-Go home, blue!
-Talking all that shit!

275
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:27,250
Just to leave,
walk outta here like a little bitch!

276
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:30,291
You guys ain't shit.
Next time, bring some muscle!

277
00:17:30,375 --> 00:17:32,666
That's right, go on!

278
00:17:36,708 --> 00:17:39,625
Come on, get gone! Go, go.
Go fuck your sisters!

279
00:17:39,708 --> 00:17:42,291
Fuck your mother.
Fuck your sister.

280
00:17:43,166 --> 00:17:44,458
And fuck your dad!

281
00:17:45,041 --> 00:17:47,375
-That's right, get outta here!
-Beat it, boy.

282
00:17:48,125 --> 00:17:50,458
-Yeah, and don't come back!
-Fuck you!

283
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:53,041
Yo, fuck off, pussies!

284
00:17:59,708 --> 00:18:01,583
Guys, I brought you some sick gifts.

285
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:05,333
Come on, Mamadou.

286
00:18:05,958 --> 00:18:07,583
Hey, you here legally, at least?

287
00:18:14,208 --> 00:18:15,208
Greg?

288
00:18:15,291 --> 00:18:17,625
No, Jérôme. I don't need this.
Don't bust my balls.

289
00:18:17,708 --> 00:18:20,208
We didn't go in the ghetto,
didn't arrest anyone.

290
00:18:20,291 --> 00:18:22,541
You asked us to walk away, we did.
I don't need a lecture--

291
00:18:22,625 --> 00:18:24,625
Wait. I didn't come here
to yell at you. It's fine.

292
00:18:24,708 --> 00:18:25,833
Then why are you here?

293
00:18:29,125 --> 00:18:32,041
I know. I know what it's like.
I've been where you are.

294
00:18:32,125 --> 00:18:33,625
-No. You don't know.
-Greg, I do.

295
00:18:33,708 --> 00:18:35,166
-You don't know why.
-Of course I do.

296
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:37,166
Why do you think I chose a desk job
ten years ago?

297
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:40,375
-'Cause you're smart and I'm a moron.
-Stop it, you're not a moron.

298
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,083
Because the field is…

299
00:18:43,916 --> 00:18:46,083
'Cause it's frustrating there.

300
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:49,541
Shit. I feel you. You feel like you're…
Like you're suffocating.

301
00:18:50,291 --> 00:18:51,208
Right?

302
00:18:51,291 --> 00:18:52,750
We're useless.

303
00:18:53,875 --> 00:18:54,958
We're useless now.

304
00:18:55,666 --> 00:18:56,625
It's over.

305
00:18:57,375 --> 00:19:01,083
The more we do, the less we achieve.
I don't understand how we got here.

306
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:04,708
I don't know, maybe it's too late.

307
00:19:05,958 --> 00:19:09,000
These people have lost all hope
that we're here to help them.

308
00:19:09,083 --> 00:19:11,833
They're resigned to living in the shit
'cause we can't help them.

309
00:19:11,916 --> 00:19:15,166
As soon as we step foot in the ghettos,
we get assaulted, spat on,

310
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:17,000
I get called a pussy every day.

311
00:19:17,083 --> 00:19:19,000
Every day I get called a pussy!

312
00:19:19,083 --> 00:19:20,291
But we can't make waves.

313
00:19:21,625 --> 00:19:23,125
We can't break our equipment.

314
00:19:24,708 --> 00:19:27,000
Just laissez-faire. So there it is.

315
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,250
It is what it is. Maybe we have a plan
and I just don't get it. What's the plan?

316
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:35,125
Explain it to me, please.
What are we doing?

317
00:19:42,458 --> 00:19:45,083
911. What's your emergency?

318
00:19:45,166 --> 00:19:46,208
Yes.

319
00:19:46,875 --> 00:19:48,708
Ma'am, we're contacting
the fire department now.

320
00:19:48,791 --> 00:19:50,000
911, what's your emergency?

321
00:19:50,083 --> 00:19:52,541
The pickpocket stealing wallets
in Grand Littoral is back.

322
00:19:52,625 --> 00:19:53,625
Know where he went?

323
00:19:53,708 --> 00:19:56,083
He's at the Mirabeau entrance.
He's wearing a red sweatshirt.

324
00:19:56,166 --> 00:19:58,916
May I ask you for your name, please?

325
00:19:59,000 --> 00:19:59,833
Hello?

326
00:20:07,625 --> 00:20:08,916
-It's me.
-Yeah, babe.

327
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,458
Remember the gypsy stealing wallets
at Grand Littoral?

328
00:20:11,541 --> 00:20:14,000
-Yeah.
-I just got a report. He's in Mirabeau.

329
00:20:14,083 --> 00:20:15,875
-Red sweatshirt.
-OK. Thanks, babe.

330
00:20:15,958 --> 00:20:18,958
OK. but hurry up, OK?
I didn't transfer it to central.

331
00:20:33,333 --> 00:20:34,416
Go on!

332
00:20:38,208 --> 00:20:39,500
Open the door!

333
00:20:41,416 --> 00:20:43,333
-No, no. Antoine!
-Come here!

334
00:20:47,291 --> 00:20:48,833
What's all this paper, huh?

335
00:20:48,916 --> 00:20:51,000
-Dealing now?
-Quit your crying!

336
00:20:56,166 --> 00:20:58,333
For real, we should've taken that cash.

337
00:20:59,375 --> 00:21:00,375
Are you stupid?

338
00:21:00,875 --> 00:21:01,708
What for?

339
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:03,958
The ginger helps himself.

340
00:21:04,041 --> 00:21:05,708
Navaro, jump in here?

341
00:21:06,625 --> 00:21:08,125
-Enough, babe.
-What you want us to say?

342
00:21:08,208 --> 00:21:10,833
-He's just an idiot. That's the way it is.
-An idiot?

343
00:21:11,333 --> 00:21:12,291
Just saying.

344
00:21:12,375 --> 00:21:14,666
No, seriously.
Go ahead and play at being gangsters.

345
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:16,208
-Babe, drop it.
-I'm serious.

346
00:21:16,291 --> 00:21:18,333
I want Tata Escobar's life too.

347
00:21:18,416 --> 00:21:20,916
I'm covered in Yass and merguez.
I want jet skis,

348
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,708
someone to slide lobsters into my mouth,
roll in a bimmer like Grace Kelly.

349
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:27,541
Maybe then you can buy a flat iron.

350
00:21:29,583 --> 00:21:31,250
And you can buy real smokes.

351
00:21:31,333 --> 00:21:33,416
-Enough with the gypsy cigs.
-Hey, please.

352
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:35,291
They smoke just like the real ones.

353
00:21:37,875 --> 00:21:40,791
Hey, Gambinos,
help me set the table. Let's go!

354
00:21:40,875 --> 00:21:43,541
Hey, hold up.
Is that any way to treat a guest?

355
00:21:43,625 --> 00:21:46,541
He's talking about robbing a bank,
and you can't manage a couple of forks?

356
00:21:46,625 --> 00:21:49,291
-Burn!
-I can't wait till your woman pops.

357
00:21:50,583 --> 00:21:52,375
I never said rob a bank.

358
00:21:54,041 --> 00:21:55,166
-This all right?
-Yeah.

359
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:56,500
-Perfect.
-Come on.

360
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,166
Is this your plate?

361
00:21:59,291 --> 00:22:01,208
-Here.
-Some chicken, Antoine?

362
00:22:01,291 --> 00:22:02,541
No, I'll take a merguez.

363
00:22:04,625 --> 00:22:06,833
Wow, you really burned
these sausages, Yass.

364
00:22:06,916 --> 00:22:08,083
Oh!

365
00:22:08,625 --> 00:22:11,291
-They're cooked, bro.
-They're not cooked, they're burned.

366
00:22:11,375 --> 00:22:12,833
-Greg?
-No.

367
00:22:12,916 --> 00:22:14,083
-For once.
-Straight protein.

368
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:15,750
Just try it once, for me.

369
00:22:15,833 --> 00:22:17,833
I don't wanna try your tomatoes.

370
00:22:19,041 --> 00:22:20,625
Yass, this is inedible.

371
00:22:20,708 --> 00:22:22,166
-It's delicious.
-Inedible.

372
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:25,000
It's delicious. You said
you wanted it crunchy, I made it crunchy.

373
00:22:25,083 --> 00:22:26,458
It's not crunchy, it's overcooked.

374
00:22:26,541 --> 00:22:28,791
-But it's crunchy.
-They are tough.

375
00:22:29,416 --> 00:22:31,916
-You wanted it crunchy, it's crunchy!
-Chill, my love.

376
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,666
-Did you make the tabbouleh?
-Yes.

377
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:34,958
Really good.

378
00:22:35,041 --> 00:22:36,625
-Oh, you ass-kisser.
-Well, hey.

379
00:22:36,708 --> 00:22:38,291
-For real?
-Try! Try this too.

380
00:22:38,375 --> 00:22:40,291
-"Did you make the tabbouleh?"
-There's mint.

381
00:22:40,375 --> 00:22:42,958
"Oh, your tabbouleh's so good!"

382
00:22:44,208 --> 00:22:46,708
-Seriously, it's so good.
-Who cooks for you?

383
00:22:47,583 --> 00:22:48,958
Well, I cook for myself.

384
00:22:49,041 --> 00:22:50,500
-All by yourself?
-Not like this.

385
00:22:50,583 --> 00:22:52,583
Your neighbor still a pain in your ass?

386
00:22:52,666 --> 00:22:53,916
No, he's calmed down.

387
00:22:54,708 --> 00:22:56,458
-Yeah?
-Broke his nose.

388
00:22:57,958 --> 00:22:59,291
-Are you kidding?
-No.

389
00:22:59,375 --> 00:23:00,375
He's 60.

390
00:23:01,041 --> 00:23:02,791
Well, if he showed some respect.

391
00:23:02,875 --> 00:23:04,875
Yeah, but you gotta stop
beating everyone up.

392
00:23:04,958 --> 00:23:06,250
What's going on with you?

393
00:23:06,791 --> 00:23:08,916
Hasn't given me a problem since.

394
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:09,833
See?

395
00:23:15,041 --> 00:23:16,875
-What's that?
-Yass, you seeing this?

396
00:23:16,958 --> 00:23:18,750
Shit, this is so embarrassing.

397
00:23:18,833 --> 00:23:20,875
-Hey, Daddy, wake up. Come on!
-Grab something!

398
00:23:20,958 --> 00:23:22,500
-They gotta go?
-What do I do?

399
00:23:22,583 --> 00:23:24,333
-So, we're going?
-Um… Uh…

400
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:25,291
-Let's go.
-Shit!

401
00:23:25,375 --> 00:23:27,208
-You OK, babe?
-Yass, come on. Hurry.

402
00:23:27,291 --> 00:23:28,458
-Got it.
-Hurry!

403
00:23:28,541 --> 00:23:31,458
-Make sure you bring the hospital bag.
-I got everything.

404
00:23:48,916 --> 00:23:49,750
Again.

405
00:23:53,375 --> 00:23:54,958
Hey. Hey!

406
00:23:55,041 --> 00:23:56,625
My brother's a daddy!

407
00:23:58,791 --> 00:24:01,666
More, Mando. Again, again!

408
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,333
Hey, on me. Drinks are on me!

409
00:24:12,208 --> 00:24:13,750
I'm fucking hammered!

410
00:24:26,958 --> 00:24:30,083
Call 911. Call 911!

411
00:25:02,916 --> 00:25:04,083
Move!

412
00:25:04,166 --> 00:25:06,041
Quit crying, you little bitch!

413
00:25:08,625 --> 00:25:10,750
I said stop crying!
Give me your fucking hand!

414
00:25:10,833 --> 00:25:12,500
Here, film him. Film him!

415
00:25:12,583 --> 00:25:14,041
Shut the fuck up!

416
00:25:14,125 --> 00:25:18,250
-I said stop crying! Shut the fuck up!
-You rob our customers, you little thief?

417
00:25:23,291 --> 00:25:24,875
Hey, neighbors, listen up!

418
00:25:24,958 --> 00:25:28,916
Here, you can buy with peace of mind.
Here, we're the police. Believe that!

419
00:25:33,291 --> 00:25:35,833
There. Went viral, huh?
Three million views.

420
00:25:37,375 --> 00:25:38,875
Prefect must be thrilled.

421
00:25:38,958 --> 00:25:42,458
Ah, you know it. He's delighted.
He wants our response to be, in his words,

422
00:25:42,541 --> 00:25:44,666
front page news-worthy
all across the country.

423
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:47,208
Listen, we need to go all out.
Make a big splash.

424
00:25:47,291 --> 00:25:50,333
-Know where this is?
-Yeah, the big complex near the water.

425
00:25:52,666 --> 00:25:53,666
Yeah…

426
00:25:54,708 --> 00:25:55,541
What?

427
00:25:56,125 --> 00:25:58,041
You've wanted
to take these drug networks down.

428
00:25:58,125 --> 00:25:59,208
Here's your ticket.

429
00:25:59,291 --> 00:26:01,375
You said we couldn't go
into ghettos anymore.

430
00:26:01,458 --> 00:26:03,333
Well, things change. Now you have to go.

431
00:26:04,791 --> 00:26:06,458
You're sucking up to the prefect?

432
00:26:09,125 --> 00:26:09,958
Greg,

433
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:11,958
this case is yours.

434
00:26:12,541 --> 00:26:16,291
Voila. You run the show.
You pick your team. Whatever you say goes.

435
00:26:16,375 --> 00:26:17,875
-Ah, I dunno.
-En garde!

436
00:26:17,958 --> 00:26:19,666
Whoa!

437
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:21,416
You think you can sneak up on me?

438
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:22,583
-Let's go!
-Don't back off.

439
00:26:22,666 --> 00:26:25,541
Wanna see what happens when
you mess with the bull? You get owned!

440
00:26:26,125 --> 00:26:27,708
This referee's the fucking worst.

441
00:26:27,791 --> 00:26:29,916
He's all short,
blowing his whistle to make up for it.

442
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,833
So angry 'cause he's short and bald.

443
00:26:32,833 --> 00:26:36,166
Yeah, go on. Take notes, take notes.

444
00:26:36,250 --> 00:26:40,458
Seriously, that coach gets on my nerves!
Always taking notes. Nose in his notebook!

445
00:26:40,541 --> 00:26:43,375
What's he writing down?
We haven't done anything in 20 minutes!

446
00:26:43,458 --> 00:26:44,791
What are you writing down?

447
00:26:47,833 --> 00:26:49,416
-By the way…
-Hmm?

448
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:51,458
-What?
-You can count me in.

449
00:27:53,708 --> 00:27:57,458
Do you understand what I'm asking for?
I'm not asking you for a dealer here.

450
00:27:58,208 --> 00:28:01,875
We wanna take down the whole network.
You need to give us some real intel.

451
00:28:02,625 --> 00:28:04,208
A distribution center, you feel me?

452
00:28:04,291 --> 00:28:06,458
You must have a death wish,
asking for that.

453
00:28:06,541 --> 00:28:08,458
-Your cousin's from there.
-My cousin?

454
00:28:08,541 --> 00:28:10,208
What do you think you'll get
from my cousin?

455
00:28:10,291 --> 00:28:13,708
-Then from you.
-You want my cousin to dig my grave?

456
00:28:14,291 --> 00:28:17,541
You haven't been to that neighborhood
in ages. Don't you get what a mess it is?

457
00:28:17,625 --> 00:28:18,708
It's like Baghdad.

458
00:28:20,125 --> 00:28:22,333
The bosses stay high
from morning till night.

459
00:28:22,416 --> 00:28:24,833
They'll kill anyone to protect their turf.

460
00:28:24,916 --> 00:28:26,375
They're the law now.

461
00:28:26,458 --> 00:28:29,416
There are no more cops or politicians,
that's all that's left.

462
00:28:30,166 --> 00:28:33,458
For Eid celebrations, they take
the kids out and give them money.

463
00:28:34,041 --> 00:28:36,041
Other than that, they're heartless.

464
00:28:36,125 --> 00:28:38,500
They even fight amongst themselves
to control the network.

465
00:28:38,583 --> 00:28:41,958
As soon as a dealer keeps
a stick for himself, it rains bullets.

466
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,458
There are no more rules. It's a jungle.

467
00:28:48,583 --> 00:28:51,625
I'm telling you,
the whole neighborhood's gone crazy.

468
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:58,291
Amel… two kilos is your cut of the haul.

469
00:28:58,375 --> 00:29:00,625
I don't want two kilos from there.
What will I do with it?

470
00:29:00,708 --> 00:29:03,083
-Why?
-You know why? Have you seen this?

471
00:29:03,166 --> 00:29:04,250
Here, smell.

472
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,541
That smell,
they're the only ones who make it.

473
00:29:11,041 --> 00:29:13,458
They're the only ones
who know what to put in it.

474
00:29:13,541 --> 00:29:15,083
It's one-of-a-kind hash.

475
00:29:15,916 --> 00:29:18,083
That's why
I can't take anything from there.

476
00:29:34,541 --> 00:29:35,541
Five kilos.

477
00:29:37,375 --> 00:29:40,250
Get me five kilos from somewhere else,
I'll get you what you need.

478
00:29:42,041 --> 00:29:42,875
Impossible.

479
00:29:43,833 --> 00:29:46,291
No, it's… That's out of the question.

480
00:29:46,375 --> 00:29:49,833
Really? Who gives a fuck?
Those drugs are gonna be destroyed anyway.

481
00:29:49,916 --> 00:29:53,416
We don't take drugs off of the streets
to put them back there. How can you ask?

482
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:56,125
Oh, here we go.
Are you saying this is a moral issue?

483
00:29:56,208 --> 00:29:57,625
Taking drugs from the evidence room

484
00:29:57,708 --> 00:30:00,833
could cause other convictions
to get tossed. You know I can't.

485
00:30:00,916 --> 00:30:03,958
-We can't give the informant the haul.
-You have to.

486
00:30:04,458 --> 00:30:06,791
Won't work.
Using their hash is a non-starter.

487
00:30:06,875 --> 00:30:07,875
What do we do?

488
00:30:07,958 --> 00:30:10,166
Just do it. Figure it out.
I don't want to know.

489
00:30:10,250 --> 00:30:11,083
What does that mean?

490
00:30:11,166 --> 00:30:14,208
It means that you find drugs
that aren't under seal or something.

491
00:30:14,291 --> 00:30:16,875
So we take all the risks
and you hide behind your desk?

492
00:30:16,958 --> 00:30:19,000
-Whoa!
-Those are the prefect's orders.

493
00:30:19,083 --> 00:30:22,125
They want a police response.
My job is to give them a police response.

494
00:30:22,208 --> 00:30:25,041
-Does that work for you?
-Give us access to the drugs under seal.

495
00:30:25,125 --> 00:30:27,750
Why should I risk my career
if we aren't given what we need?

496
00:30:27,833 --> 00:30:29,750
Fuck this.
Nobody gives a shit about the ghettos.

497
00:30:29,833 --> 00:30:32,375
The prefect just wants positive press
in the front page.

498
00:30:32,458 --> 00:30:34,250
That's not true. You're wrong.

499
00:30:37,125 --> 00:30:38,708
So, then what's in it for us?

500
00:30:38,791 --> 00:30:39,625
Raises.

501
00:30:41,916 --> 00:30:43,541
-How much?
-I don't know.

502
00:30:43,625 --> 00:30:45,583
One, possibly two.

503
00:30:45,666 --> 00:30:47,166
Are you serious?

504
00:30:47,250 --> 00:30:49,958
We're gonna do this for 50,
100 euros tops per month?

505
00:30:50,041 --> 00:30:52,000
-And we're risking the blame?
-What blame?

506
00:30:52,083 --> 00:30:54,791
Worried a sanction could keep you
from taking your officer exam?

507
00:30:54,875 --> 00:30:56,416
-It looks bad.
-So what?

508
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:58,000
You want to become an officer?

509
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,125
Do this operation.

510
00:31:02,291 --> 00:31:03,750
Yeah. OK, we got it.

511
00:31:05,791 --> 00:31:06,791
Yeah.

512
00:31:07,375 --> 00:31:08,625
So, figure it out?

513
00:31:08,708 --> 00:31:09,708
That's right.

514
00:31:20,833 --> 00:31:22,666
-Good evening, police.
-Evening.

515
00:31:39,250 --> 00:31:40,833
Should we grab him?

516
00:31:40,916 --> 00:31:42,416
Come on.

517
00:31:44,333 --> 00:31:45,500
Park over there, sir.

518
00:31:48,208 --> 00:31:50,208
Evening, police. Can I ask you,
what you doing here?

519
00:31:50,291 --> 00:31:53,333
-I came to visit a friend.
-All right. Let's keep this simple.

520
00:31:53,416 --> 00:31:56,833
Either you give me the drugs you purchased
or I take you to the station.

521
00:31:56,916 --> 00:32:00,750
OK. Come on, empty your pockets.
Here, come on. Show me what you got.

522
00:32:01,250 --> 00:32:03,000
Well, your friend seems cool.

523
00:32:03,083 --> 00:32:05,125
-Is that all?
-It's all I have.

524
00:32:05,208 --> 00:32:07,833
-OK.
-All right, let's get outta here.

525
00:32:14,416 --> 00:32:18,041
-He fucking shit himself.
-He fucking shit himself.

526
00:32:19,916 --> 00:32:22,583
-Did you see that?
-Oh, I actually felt sorry for him.

527
00:32:26,208 --> 00:32:28,416
Hey, are you gonna sulk
like that all night?

528
00:32:29,291 --> 00:32:31,666
No, it's fine.
I'll take the next one. All good?

529
00:32:32,375 --> 00:32:33,500
OK?

530
00:32:50,750 --> 00:32:52,541
-Ooh!
-Come here!

531
00:32:52,625 --> 00:32:54,208
Let me go. Let me go!

532
00:32:54,833 --> 00:32:56,375
Caught in the act.

533
00:32:56,458 --> 00:32:59,166
-Will you help him already?
-No way, he's on him.

534
00:32:59,791 --> 00:33:02,458
Oh fuck!
Little fucker's fired up today.

535
00:33:02,541 --> 00:33:05,250
-Got him hog-tied.
-Are you spanking him?

536
00:33:05,333 --> 00:33:07,333
-Give him.
-Take this piece of shit.

537
00:33:07,416 --> 00:33:09,666
Fuck you and your whore mother!
Get off me, bitch!

538
00:33:09,750 --> 00:33:12,291
Shut up with your man bun.
Fucking barista bitch.

539
00:33:12,375 --> 00:33:14,333
-Take it easy.
-I'll fuck your mother in the face!

540
00:33:14,416 --> 00:33:16,875
Don't touch me! Fuck the BAC!
I'll fuck you up the ass.

541
00:33:16,958 --> 00:33:18,916
-Shut your trap!
-Fuck all you all. You ain't shit!

542
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,208
-Fucking bunch of pigs. Shut up, I said.
-Shut up.

543
00:33:21,291 --> 00:33:23,125
Come on, you, with your old ass in front.

544
00:33:23,208 --> 00:33:24,458
-Whoa!
-Stupid-ass bitch!

545
00:33:24,541 --> 00:33:27,666
-I'll fuck you up. What you gonna do?
-Watch your mouth, you!

546
00:33:27,750 --> 00:33:30,708
Fucking dinosaur-looking bitch.
Throw me out, I don't give a shit.

547
00:33:30,791 --> 00:33:33,833
-Don't fucking touch me, I'm a minor.
-Shut your mouth.

548
00:33:33,916 --> 00:33:36,583
Let me outta here. I'm supposed to be
fucking your mom, fucking whore.

549
00:33:36,666 --> 00:33:38,125
I'll fuck your sister in the shower--

550
00:33:38,208 --> 00:33:41,250
-You got little dick syndrome in the back?
-Speed up, you pussy!

551
00:33:41,333 --> 00:33:43,750
Yass, put some music on.
I can't deal with this.

552
00:33:43,833 --> 00:33:45,666
-You're a bitch!
-Hurry up.

553
00:33:48,625 --> 00:33:50,583
-Shut up!
-Perfect. All right.

554
00:33:50,666 --> 00:33:53,666
Hey, turn it up. Turn it up!

555
00:33:56,083 --> 00:33:57,291
Yeah!

556
00:34:02,625 --> 00:34:03,625
Yeah!

557
00:34:03,708 --> 00:34:05,833
Listen to this guy in the back, huh?

558
00:34:10,125 --> 00:34:12,125
Watch you looking at.
Get you some, nephew.

559
00:34:15,833 --> 00:34:19,500
-Hurry up, driver. Go on, speed up.
-You're driving like an old man.

560
00:34:21,250 --> 00:34:23,166
-What? What?
-Let's go!

561
00:34:23,250 --> 00:34:25,458
Come on!

562
00:34:25,541 --> 00:34:29,333
Can you pick a lane already?
Maybe you need to get your eyes checked.

563
00:34:31,791 --> 00:34:34,708
Oh, smile. You love me!
You know you love me!

564
00:34:40,875 --> 00:34:41,875
Get on it!

565
00:34:43,208 --> 00:34:44,208
Yeah!

566
00:34:49,958 --> 00:34:52,125
Whoa!

567
00:34:53,833 --> 00:34:54,916
Oh yeah!

568
00:35:05,291 --> 00:35:07,500
Whoop, whoop,
that's the sound of the police!

569
00:35:09,708 --> 00:35:10,791
Motherfucker.

570
00:35:12,916 --> 00:35:14,666
-Good evening. Police.
-Yeah?

571
00:35:14,750 --> 00:35:16,791
What you bought back there,
give it here, please.

572
00:35:17,875 --> 00:35:19,500
Uh, it's just my personal stash.

573
00:35:19,583 --> 00:35:22,041
Oh, my friend. Don't start stuttering.
We saw you. Give it here.

574
00:35:22,125 --> 00:35:24,041
-It's all I have.
-That's all there is?

575
00:35:24,125 --> 00:35:24,958
It's all I have.

576
00:35:25,875 --> 00:35:28,125
-I swear.
-OK, I'll let you off this time. Go.

577
00:35:31,708 --> 00:35:33,833
Shit, I'd really love to go there.

578
00:35:34,333 --> 00:35:35,916
-Where?
-Outer space.

579
00:35:37,333 --> 00:35:39,666
-You wanna go to outer space?
-Well, yeah.

580
00:35:39,750 --> 00:35:40,875
Lifelong dream.

581
00:35:40,958 --> 00:35:43,583
People are starting to go there.
Tourists and everything.

582
00:35:43,666 --> 00:35:45,875
-Yeah, rich people.
-Oh, for sure.

583
00:35:47,250 --> 00:35:49,041
Still, just imagine seeing it.

584
00:35:50,166 --> 00:35:52,750
Our planet all small in the distance.
You feel me?

585
00:35:53,250 --> 00:35:55,000
-Crazy, no?
-Insane.

586
00:35:57,250 --> 00:35:58,583
You can see it all round.

587
00:35:59,791 --> 00:36:01,958
-What's your point?
-Normally, it's flat, not round.

588
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:11,041
-Got ourselves a real astronomer.
-He's so stupid!

589
00:36:11,125 --> 00:36:14,458
Honestly, I wish I could go to outer space
so I wouldn't have to see your faces.

590
00:36:14,541 --> 00:36:16,208
Dumbass!

591
00:36:18,583 --> 00:36:20,458
Whoa, whoa, what's he doing?

592
00:36:21,416 --> 00:36:22,666
Fucking hell.

593
00:36:24,541 --> 00:36:27,250
What are you guys doing?
Hey, what are you doing?

594
00:36:27,333 --> 00:36:29,333
-What are you talking about?
-What do you mean?

595
00:36:29,416 --> 00:36:31,958
Fuck, you've been robbing my customers
for the last hour!

596
00:36:32,041 --> 00:36:34,125
-We're not doing anything.
-What do you mean?

597
00:36:34,208 --> 00:36:36,125
Been watching you.
Why you robbing my customers?

598
00:36:36,208 --> 00:36:38,666
What's going on? Where'd you come from?

599
00:36:38,750 --> 00:36:42,041
What gives you the right to come
to my place and fuck all my customers?

600
00:36:42,125 --> 00:36:44,583
-We didn't know this was your place.
-You didn't know?

601
00:36:44,666 --> 00:36:46,833
This is somebody's place, isn't it?
Don't talk like that.

602
00:36:46,916 --> 00:36:49,208
-Yeah?
-So, you're here to screw people over?

603
00:36:49,291 --> 00:36:50,583
-No.
-You son of a bitch!

604
00:36:50,666 --> 00:36:52,958
-Hey, don't talk like that.
-Fucking shit, huh?

605
00:36:53,041 --> 00:36:54,958
-"Don't talk like that."
-Don't get worked up.

606
00:36:55,041 --> 00:36:57,541
You come here, fuck me up the ass,
and I shouldn't get worked up?

607
00:36:57,625 --> 00:36:59,791
Don't shush me!

608
00:36:59,875 --> 00:37:02,666
-You're a bunch of thieves.
-Shut the fuck up!

609
00:37:02,750 --> 00:37:05,583
-Calm down, OK?
-You can't tell me what to do!

610
00:37:05,666 --> 00:37:07,500
-Whoa. Hey.
-What are you doing, huh?

611
00:37:07,583 --> 00:37:09,708
-Whoa!
-Don't tell me to get in the car!

612
00:37:09,791 --> 00:37:11,208
Put that thing away!

613
00:37:11,291 --> 00:37:14,125
-You think I'm scared of you?
-Back up. Lower your weapon.

614
00:37:14,208 --> 00:37:16,958
-Put it away. Lower your weapon.
-I'm not lowering my weapon. Fuck you!

615
00:37:17,041 --> 00:37:18,583
-Lower your weapon.
-You're fucking dead.

616
00:37:18,666 --> 00:37:20,750
-I said put that away!
-Get back in your car.

617
00:37:20,833 --> 00:37:23,083
You're on my turf!
You go home, you punk bitch!

618
00:37:23,166 --> 00:37:24,666
Go on. Lower your weapon.

619
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:28,416
-You think you're bad, huh?
-I'll fuck you up!

620
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:30,916
Your face looks familiar,
you son of a bitch.

621
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,041
-You and I know each other, right?
-No.

622
00:37:33,125 --> 00:37:35,958
We don't? Go back to the police station,
fuck your mother, son of a bitch.

623
00:37:36,041 --> 00:37:38,083
They're pigs. Come on, let's bounce.

624
00:37:38,708 --> 00:37:40,250
-Crooked ass.
-Pigs.

625
00:37:40,333 --> 00:37:42,666
You're a bunch
of dirty motherfuckers!

626
00:37:43,166 --> 00:37:45,625
Earn your thousand euros a week, assholes!

627
00:37:45,708 --> 00:37:46,541
Slaves!

628
00:37:46,625 --> 00:37:51,625
-Go on, get in your Cayenne, motherfucker.
-I recognize you! See you soon!

629
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,958
Are you crazy? You piece of shit!

630
00:37:58,041 --> 00:38:00,041
-What are you doing?
-What happens if they shoot?

631
00:38:00,125 --> 00:38:01,458
-What happens?
-Whoa!

632
00:38:01,541 --> 00:38:02,625
-What then?
-Calm down!

633
00:38:02,708 --> 00:38:05,333
-Huh? What happens?
-What the fuck is wrong with you?

634
00:38:05,416 --> 00:38:07,458
-Calm down from what? Fuck!
-Calm down!

635
00:38:07,541 --> 00:38:09,208
-It didn't go to shit.
-Your shitty plan!

636
00:38:09,291 --> 00:38:11,541
-Calm down.
-Fuck you, calm down!

637
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,250
Hey, I have a family.

638
00:38:15,291 --> 00:38:16,583
You're acting like thugs!

639
00:38:19,083 --> 00:38:21,166
-And you with your shitty plans!
-Get in the car.

640
00:38:21,250 --> 00:38:23,500
Yeah, now we're thinking straight.

641
00:38:36,375 --> 00:38:38,166
-Good thing I--
-Shut your mouth!

642
00:38:39,791 --> 00:38:42,166
Get in the car. We're leaving.
Get in the car.

643
00:38:42,250 --> 00:38:43,958
Get in the fucking car, Antoine!

644
00:38:44,041 --> 00:38:45,500
You get in the car!

645
00:38:46,666 --> 00:38:48,791
I'm the only one with any balls here.

646
00:38:49,291 --> 00:38:50,291
Bunch of clowns.

647
00:38:58,208 --> 00:39:00,041
-Hello?
-You gotta get over here now.

648
00:39:00,125 --> 00:39:02,291
-What the fuck are you doing?
-Hang on, calm down. What?

649
00:39:02,375 --> 00:39:04,375
Yeah, I'm serious.
You gotta get the fuck over here.

650
00:39:04,458 --> 00:39:06,500
-I'm freaking the fuck out.
-OK. Where are you?

651
00:39:06,583 --> 00:39:07,541
I'm at the spot.

652
00:39:13,583 --> 00:39:16,833
-What's the matter?
-Are you stupid or something?

653
00:39:16,916 --> 00:39:20,416
What did you do at Square des Oliviers?
You're robbing people now?

654
00:39:21,916 --> 00:39:24,083
-Who told you that?
-Don't ask who told me.

655
00:39:24,166 --> 00:39:26,833
-Seriously. Did you or did you not?
-That's enough. Answer me.

656
00:39:26,916 --> 00:39:28,625
-Where'd you hear that?
-In my neighborhood.

657
00:39:28,708 --> 00:39:32,291
People talk. Are you mental? They talk.
Are you guys crazy or something?

658
00:39:33,083 --> 00:39:35,041
-I don't want to die.
-That's not your problem.

659
00:39:35,125 --> 00:39:37,291
-Stop saying it's not my problem.
-It's not your problem!

660
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:39,291
-Did you see anything? No.
-What, are you psychic?

661
00:39:39,375 --> 00:39:40,875
-Are we being followed?
-Yes.

662
00:39:40,958 --> 00:39:42,958
I leave my place, I don't feel right.
It's fucked up.

663
00:39:43,041 --> 00:39:45,541
Everywhere people look at me,
I feel like they know me.

664
00:39:45,625 --> 00:39:47,625
People see us. People know us.

665
00:39:47,708 --> 00:39:51,208
-What do you mean following us?
-I feel like I'm being followed.

666
00:39:51,291 --> 00:39:54,208
There, Mr. Antoine, I feel like
I'm being followed when I leave my home.

667
00:39:54,291 --> 00:39:56,000
-By who? Where?
-Someone from the quarter.

668
00:39:56,083 --> 00:39:57,791
-Think they know about us?
-Of course.

669
00:39:57,875 --> 00:40:00,333
-People in your hood don't know me.
-Stop saying that.

670
00:40:00,416 --> 00:40:02,083
Are you part of the BAC, yes or no?

671
00:40:02,166 --> 00:40:03,666
-Are you part of the BAC?
-Yes.

672
00:40:03,750 --> 00:40:05,333
BAC south or BAC north?

673
00:40:05,416 --> 00:40:06,375
-BAC north?
-Yeah.

674
00:40:06,458 --> 00:40:07,333
-All right.
-So what?

675
00:40:07,416 --> 00:40:09,166
And where are we now? North quarter?

676
00:40:09,250 --> 00:40:11,208
People in my precinct know me,
no one in yours.

677
00:40:11,291 --> 00:40:13,708
They're only two minutes apart, right?

678
00:40:13,791 --> 00:40:14,666
Answer me!

679
00:40:14,750 --> 00:40:17,125
You've been in my neighborhood before,
right? People know you.

680
00:40:17,208 --> 00:40:18,250
Got any weed on you?

681
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:22,375
I'm telling you,
you're spiraling out.

682
00:40:22,458 --> 00:40:24,625
-What the fuck are you doing?
-Hey!

683
00:40:24,708 --> 00:40:26,791
-Please, give it back. I'm not playing.
-Look at this.

684
00:40:26,875 --> 00:40:28,708
-Give it.
-This is all you need.

685
00:40:29,291 --> 00:40:31,125
-Here. You keep this.
-Oh, but you--

686
00:40:31,208 --> 00:40:32,875
Ease up on the weed. You're spiraling out.

687
00:40:32,958 --> 00:40:34,875
-Think I'm making it up?
-You're getting paranoid.

688
00:40:34,958 --> 00:40:37,666
-Yeah. Did you smoke before coming here?
-No, I didn't smoke.

689
00:40:37,750 --> 00:40:39,333
-Did you smoke before coming?
-No.

690
00:40:39,416 --> 00:40:42,458
Look at me. You're high.
You're just fucking with me here.

691
00:40:42,541 --> 00:40:43,541
I see you.

692
00:40:45,541 --> 00:40:46,458
Hey.

693
00:40:47,375 --> 00:40:50,250
What happened at the Oliviers,
it's nothing.

694
00:40:50,333 --> 00:40:52,458
Nobody cares. Changes nothing.

695
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,083
Amel, go back home.

696
00:40:55,958 --> 00:40:57,583
Lay low. Let me handle the rest.

697
00:40:57,666 --> 00:40:59,291
-But…
-You got me or not?

698
00:41:01,416 --> 00:41:02,666
You're not in danger.

699
00:41:04,166 --> 00:41:05,041
You have my word.

700
00:41:05,833 --> 00:41:07,750
Why you touching my shoulder
like that, player?

701
00:41:07,833 --> 00:41:09,458
-Is this better?
-You're a flirt.

702
00:41:09,541 --> 00:41:11,083
-Oh yeah?
-Mm-hmm.

703
00:41:15,250 --> 00:41:17,666
Gonna be mad at each other
like this for much longer?

704
00:41:17,750 --> 00:41:20,916
Enough already. Get over it.
I dunno what you have to do to make peace.

705
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:24,208
I'm tired of this shit.

706
00:41:24,958 --> 00:41:27,083
Did you seriously say, "Make peace"?

707
00:41:27,166 --> 00:41:29,416
What kind of stupid expression is that?

708
00:41:29,958 --> 00:41:32,500
"Let's make peace,"
says the BAC philosopher

709
00:41:32,583 --> 00:41:35,250
-What's so funny?
-You're the BAC philosopher now.

710
00:41:35,333 --> 00:41:38,458
-Peace it is, Mahatma fucking Ghandi.
-That's funny to you too?

711
00:41:40,166 --> 00:41:41,500
Your face makes me laugh.

712
00:41:41,583 --> 00:41:44,166
Calling all available cars,
requesting immediate backup.

713
00:41:44,250 --> 00:41:46,666
Priority. We're surrounded. Need backup.

714
00:41:47,375 --> 00:41:49,916
BAC17, this is TN13.
Confirm your location.

715
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,333
Square des Oliviers!
I repeat, Square des Oliviers.

716
00:41:52,416 --> 00:41:53,875
Send people, shit! Hurry.

717
00:41:53,958 --> 00:41:56,666
TN13 to all available units
in the north sector.

718
00:41:56,750 --> 00:41:59,583
Officers in trouble
in the Square des Oliviers area.

719
00:41:59,666 --> 00:42:01,875
Respond to TN13 ASAP.

720
00:42:01,958 --> 00:42:03,125
Turn off the radio.

721
00:42:03,750 --> 00:42:05,166
-No!
-Turn it off!

722
00:42:05,750 --> 00:42:07,250
No way!

723
00:42:19,333 --> 00:42:21,791
-Fucking hell, where were you?
-We couldn't come.

724
00:42:21,875 --> 00:42:23,791
Sorry, you had something better to do?

725
00:42:24,875 --> 00:42:26,833
Shit! What kind of cop have you become?

726
00:42:26,916 --> 00:42:28,958
Leaving us to take a beating
without lifting a finger.

727
00:42:29,041 --> 00:42:32,083
-Don't lecture me.
-Got something you want to say to me?

728
00:42:33,208 --> 00:42:34,041
Pfft. Whatever.

729
00:42:34,958 --> 00:42:35,791
Jacques…

730
00:42:37,375 --> 00:42:39,000
Listen, I'm sorry. OK?

731
00:42:39,083 --> 00:42:42,000
I don't give a shit if you're sorry
or about your apology.

732
00:42:42,083 --> 00:42:43,916
-We almost got killed!
-Calm down.

733
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,041
-Hey, I apologize.
-Fuck you, you son of a bitch!

734
00:42:48,041 --> 00:42:49,375
What? What

735
00:42:57,291 --> 00:42:58,541
I can explain, all right?

736
00:43:00,916 --> 00:43:05,208
We've been working nights for three weeks.
We've gathered about two kilos.

737
00:43:05,291 --> 00:43:08,875
But, Greg, you've been outed
in the northern neighborhoods.

738
00:43:08,958 --> 00:43:12,166
So you're gonna need to go downtown
together to collect the rest.

739
00:43:12,250 --> 00:43:14,166
And no more trouble. I'm serious.

740
00:43:14,250 --> 00:43:15,208
OK.

741
00:43:32,208 --> 00:43:33,708
Go on!

742
00:44:09,458 --> 00:44:10,666
Say you stole the bag!

743
00:44:40,791 --> 00:44:43,666
-Hey! Hey, whoa!
-Whoa!

744
00:44:51,583 --> 00:44:52,833
What is this shit?

745
00:44:54,541 --> 00:44:56,791
Tunisian designer.

746
00:44:56,875 --> 00:44:57,916
Couscous Chanel!

747
00:45:01,166 --> 00:45:02,666
Empty your pockets!

748
00:45:41,208 --> 00:45:42,833
You change diapers and everything?

749
00:45:42,916 --> 00:45:45,666
I looked it up online.
I couldn't figure it out in the beginning.

750
00:45:45,750 --> 00:45:47,083
What do you mean you looked it up?

751
00:45:47,166 --> 00:45:49,166
How to put on a diaper, man.
It's not that easy.

752
00:45:49,250 --> 00:45:50,750
-What, there are tutorials?
-Yeah.

753
00:45:50,833 --> 00:45:51,875
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

754
00:45:53,208 --> 00:45:54,041
And you like it?

755
00:45:54,750 --> 00:45:56,083
No, it smells like shit.

756
00:45:56,166 --> 00:45:58,708
It literally smells like shit. No lie.

757
00:45:58,791 --> 00:45:59,666
-Oh yeah?
-Yeah.

758
00:46:00,458 --> 00:46:02,625
It's not all diapers.
I like the rest of it.

759
00:46:03,708 --> 00:46:04,791
Best part of my day.

760
00:46:06,208 --> 00:46:08,666
In any case, you make a good uncle.

761
00:46:12,291 --> 00:46:13,291
He's beautiful.

762
00:46:14,250 --> 00:46:17,375
He gets it all from his mother.
Thank God he looks like his mother.

763
00:46:21,500 --> 00:46:25,583
In three days, there's gonna be
a big shipment coming to the ghetto.

764
00:46:25,666 --> 00:46:27,083
In the apartment towers.

765
00:46:27,166 --> 00:46:28,958
All the bosses will be there.

766
00:46:30,291 --> 00:46:33,333
But just for one day. And then…

767
00:46:33,416 --> 00:46:35,250
-Three days?
-Yeah.

768
00:46:38,750 --> 00:46:40,625
-Which apartment tower?
-I don't know.

769
00:46:40,708 --> 00:46:43,166
Which block?
What do you mean you don't know?

770
00:46:43,250 --> 00:46:45,083
The only thing I can guarantee you

771
00:46:45,166 --> 00:46:47,166
is that they're so paranoid
about their dope,

772
00:46:47,250 --> 00:46:50,000
they're never gonna let a dealer
get caught with a full bag.

773
00:46:50,791 --> 00:46:55,000
Any sign of trouble, there's a guy nearby
whose job it is to pick up the bag,

774
00:46:55,083 --> 00:46:56,458
bring it to the safe house.

775
00:46:59,291 --> 00:47:01,000
Normally, if you follow the sack,

776
00:47:01,958 --> 00:47:04,041
it'll take you
to the apartment you're looking for.

777
00:47:18,166 --> 00:47:19,083
Did you hear me?

778
00:47:23,916 --> 00:47:25,041
Yeah, I heard you.

779
00:49:19,125 --> 00:49:20,875
There's a yellow vehicle approaching.

780
00:49:21,958 --> 00:49:23,833
A yellow vehicle is headed
toward the towers.

781
00:49:23,916 --> 00:49:25,916
I repeat, yellow vehicle
headed toward the towers.

782
00:49:28,541 --> 00:49:30,666
Yeah, I got eyes on it.

783
00:49:43,958 --> 00:49:46,375
There are two men with masks
searching the car.

784
00:49:53,708 --> 00:49:55,708
The car is headed for block M.

785
00:50:01,541 --> 00:50:04,791
I got eyes on the dealer.
Bandana covering his face, black cap.

786
00:50:04,875 --> 00:50:06,625
Some kind of drawing on his bag.

787
00:50:06,708 --> 00:50:10,125
I got eyes on the dealer, M block.
I repeat, eyes on the dealer.

788
00:50:17,458 --> 00:50:19,000
Transaction is complete.

789
00:50:25,875 --> 00:50:27,833
The dealer is posted up
in front of block M.

790
00:50:27,916 --> 00:50:30,791
I repeat, the dealer is posted up
in front of block M.

791
00:50:34,500 --> 00:50:36,166
All teams, standby for the ready.

792
00:50:36,666 --> 00:50:38,875
A reminder, do not apprehend.
Just tail them.

793
00:50:39,666 --> 00:50:41,583
We follow the bag
so we can find their stash.

794
00:50:41,666 --> 00:50:43,041
We locate the stash no matter what.

795
00:50:44,250 --> 00:50:45,333
OK. Roger that.

796
00:50:52,666 --> 00:50:54,625
-Antoine, do you read me?
-Yeah.

797
00:50:55,125 --> 00:50:56,208
OK, you're up, buddy.

798
00:50:56,291 --> 00:50:58,750
-The dealer is in front of block M.
-OK.

799
00:51:42,875 --> 00:51:44,125
You got that fire?

800
00:51:44,666 --> 00:51:46,875
Go to block C over there,
in front of the dumpsters.

801
00:51:52,416 --> 00:51:53,791
All teams, he's en route.

802
00:51:54,750 --> 00:51:55,708
Mount up.

803
00:52:09,333 --> 00:52:12,250
Our team has eyes on Antoine.
He's walking down the alley.

804
00:52:12,333 --> 00:52:14,916
He should come into your view
any moment now.

805
00:52:44,875 --> 00:52:46,500
Popo!

806
00:52:46,583 --> 00:52:49,500
Popo! Popo!

807
00:52:53,125 --> 00:52:56,041
Popo!

808
00:52:57,416 --> 00:52:59,625
Go, go, go, go, go. Let's go! Go!

809
00:53:06,791 --> 00:53:09,250
Come on.
Go, go, go, go! Let's go! Let's go!

810
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:31,958
Whoa!

811
00:53:33,208 --> 00:53:35,041
Whoa! Hey, what's the matter?

812
00:53:35,125 --> 00:53:37,125
-Get back! I said get back!
-Hey, man.

813
00:53:37,208 --> 00:53:39,916
I said get back!

814
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:41,166
Come on, man.

815
00:53:41,250 --> 00:53:43,083
Calm down! I said get back!

816
00:53:43,166 --> 00:53:44,916
-Get back!
-Those fuckers!

817
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:46,875
Get back. Get back!

818
00:53:48,666 --> 00:53:50,750
Hey, Jacques. Blue T-shirt, black mask!

819
00:53:50,833 --> 00:53:52,083
Blue T-shirt, black mask.

820
00:53:52,166 --> 00:53:56,083
Blue T-shirt, black mask.
Blue T-shirt, black mask. Get back!

821
00:53:57,458 --> 00:54:00,375
Got it. I see him!
I got eyes. I got eyes!

822
00:54:03,250 --> 00:54:04,583
I'm following the bag!

823
00:54:05,291 --> 00:54:06,625
Block K16! Block K16!

824
00:54:09,625 --> 00:54:11,625
I'm going in. I'm going in!

825
00:54:15,958 --> 00:54:17,750
Get back!

826
00:54:36,333 --> 00:54:38,708
Stash house located. Fifth floor.

827
00:54:54,625 --> 00:54:56,583
Open up, you son of a bitch! Open up!

828
00:55:10,083 --> 00:55:10,916
Open up!

829
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:15,416
Kill all these pigs!

830
00:55:20,250 --> 00:55:21,083
Open the door!

831
00:55:26,583 --> 00:55:29,916
Requesting immediate backup!
I repeat, requesting immediate backup!

832
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,166
We have an officer trapped in block K16!

833
00:55:34,125 --> 00:55:36,666
Open the door. Open your door!

834
00:55:37,541 --> 00:55:40,416
-Hey, what are you doing? Get outta here!
-Sir! Sir!

835
00:55:40,500 --> 00:55:42,416
-What are you doing?
-Are you crazy or something?

836
00:55:42,500 --> 00:55:44,041
-Get out!
-OK!

837
00:55:44,125 --> 00:55:45,291
Stop!

838
00:55:46,208 --> 00:55:47,291
-Stay there.
-Sir!

839
00:55:47,833 --> 00:55:49,583
-He's in here!
-Shut your mouth!

840
00:55:49,666 --> 00:55:51,708
What'd we do?

841
00:55:51,791 --> 00:55:52,916
Move! Sit down. Quiet!

842
00:55:54,250 --> 00:55:58,041
Blocks 15 and 16 should connect
through the roofs. Let's go. Let's go!

843
00:55:58,125 --> 00:56:00,041
-Come on! Yeah!
-Both of us?

844
00:56:03,208 --> 00:56:04,583
Oh!

845
00:56:10,291 --> 00:56:13,541
Yass! Yass! Greg, Antoine are
on their way. Stay where you are!

846
00:56:13,625 --> 00:56:15,708
I'm on the sixth floor. Apartment 630.

847
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:20,875
Please, sir.
We didn't do anything.

848
00:57:22,416 --> 00:57:23,541
Yass, we're coming.

849
00:57:23,625 --> 00:57:27,541
Apartment 630, sixth floor.
I repeat, apartment 630--

850
00:57:27,625 --> 00:57:28,750
Fuck!

851
00:57:41,583 --> 00:57:43,208
-You OK, bro?
-I'm OK.

852
00:57:43,291 --> 00:57:44,416
-Hey!
-I'm OK.

853
00:57:52,250 --> 00:57:53,833
Come on, let's go. Come on.

854
00:57:53,916 --> 00:57:55,666
God help us.

855
00:57:55,750 --> 00:57:58,291
What are you doing?
Get the fuck outta here!

856
00:58:00,666 --> 00:58:03,083
-Get back!
-Go ahead. Go on, shoot!

857
00:58:03,166 --> 00:58:05,666
-Go on, shoot! Go on, shoot. Come on!
-Get back!

858
00:58:05,750 --> 00:58:06,583
Shoot!

859
00:58:08,583 --> 00:58:09,500
Come on!

860
00:58:14,500 --> 00:58:15,500
On the right.

861
00:58:20,083 --> 00:58:21,291
Is that the door, Yass?

862
00:59:32,916 --> 00:59:34,000
Yass, cover me.

863
01:00:04,208 --> 01:00:05,250
-You OK?
-Yeah.

864
01:00:07,083 --> 01:00:08,541
Jacques…

865
01:00:09,250 --> 01:00:12,250
We're in another apartment,
still moving on the fifth floor.

866
01:00:12,333 --> 01:00:13,791
Hurry the fuck up. Hurry up!

867
01:00:23,625 --> 01:00:25,583
Get the fuck outta my neighborhood!

868
01:00:25,666 --> 01:00:27,916
Come on, guys. Go, go, go!

869
01:00:58,458 --> 01:01:00,291
Get the fuck outta here. Go!

870
01:01:13,125 --> 01:01:14,333
Go! Go!

871
01:01:14,875 --> 01:01:16,166
Hey, you!

872
01:01:16,250 --> 01:01:17,666
Put that down over there.

873
01:01:19,041 --> 01:01:20,041
Get on it!

874
01:01:20,875 --> 01:01:24,375
-Move it. Move it!
-Put it in the bag. Let's go!

875
01:01:24,458 --> 01:01:25,583
-Move!
-OK!

876
01:01:26,500 --> 01:01:28,583
-Get the bag.
-Let's go, let's go!

877
01:01:28,666 --> 01:01:30,500
Toss me that. Move! Move!

878
01:01:30,583 --> 01:01:32,625
-Go out there.
-Go, go!

879
01:01:33,666 --> 01:01:35,625
-We got you.
-Go, go!

880
01:01:35,708 --> 01:01:38,166
-Hurry up. Come on! Let's go.
-Go!

881
01:01:38,250 --> 01:01:40,875
-Toss it.
-Don't forget to flush!

882
01:01:40,958 --> 01:01:43,708
-Right there!
-Come on. Let's go!

883
01:01:43,791 --> 01:01:45,125
We gotta get outta here.

884
01:01:57,416 --> 01:02:01,416
-Move it! Move, let's go!
-The drugs are in the communal trash room.

885
01:02:03,791 --> 01:02:06,083
Yeah. What the fuck was that?

886
01:02:06,166 --> 01:02:08,375
-Shit! What the fuck?
-They're gassing us!

887
01:02:08,458 --> 01:02:10,875
-Get the fuck outta here!
-Move!

888
01:02:10,958 --> 01:02:14,625
Come on, let's get the fuck outta here!

889
01:02:19,333 --> 01:02:20,625
Get the fuck out!

890
01:02:44,416 --> 01:02:47,208
-Let's get outta here.
-Come on, run faster!

891
01:02:49,958 --> 01:02:52,333
Get against the wall!

892
01:03:01,625 --> 01:03:02,916
Get back! Get back!

893
01:03:23,083 --> 01:03:25,500
He's out! He's out! He's out!

894
01:03:28,625 --> 01:03:30,208
Don't move! Don't move!

895
01:03:34,500 --> 01:03:35,500
Don't move!

896
01:03:39,958 --> 01:03:41,375
They're here!

897
01:03:45,541 --> 01:03:48,375
-What we got here? Help me.
-You're under arrest!

898
01:03:48,458 --> 01:03:50,375
Don't move! Party's over, bro.

899
01:04:04,041 --> 01:04:05,333
Get the fuck outta here!

900
01:04:07,375 --> 01:04:08,583
Shoot! Shoot him!

901
01:04:09,750 --> 01:04:12,625
Hey, get outta here now!
Get outta here! You, beat it!

902
01:04:15,250 --> 01:04:17,625
-Get the fuck outta here!
-Beat it!

903
01:04:17,708 --> 01:04:20,875
-Back up! Move it! Back the fuck up!
-Move! Move!

904
01:04:20,958 --> 01:04:22,958
-Move!
-Get back! Get back!

905
01:04:24,416 --> 01:04:26,250
Beat it! You, beat it!

906
01:04:26,333 --> 01:04:28,000
Back up! Back up!

907
01:04:33,791 --> 01:04:35,625
Go! Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

908
01:04:38,458 --> 01:04:41,791
-I'm gonna kill you, Pig!
-Drive, drive!

909
01:04:41,875 --> 01:04:44,875
Go! Oh shit! Move! Move!

910
01:04:47,958 --> 01:04:50,083
-What the fuck?
-Go! Go!

911
01:04:58,916 --> 01:05:00,583
This is fucking crazy!

912
01:05:08,750 --> 01:05:10,000
Drive, drive!

913
01:05:10,083 --> 01:05:12,125
-Fuck it, just drive!
-Go, go, go!

914
01:05:12,666 --> 01:05:13,750
Go, go, go!

915
01:05:16,958 --> 01:05:19,500
-Oh shit!
-Go, go, go, go, go, go!

916
01:05:24,458 --> 01:05:26,208
Yass, you OK? You OK?

917
01:05:26,291 --> 01:05:27,666
-Are you OK?
-Yeah.

918
01:05:27,750 --> 01:05:30,333
Don't stop, don't stop!
Go, go, go. Don't stop!

919
01:05:30,875 --> 01:05:32,083
Holy shit!

920
01:06:01,750 --> 01:06:04,750
North BAC gets it done,
that's why!

921
01:06:05,541 --> 01:06:09,083
It's because of you that
we're the best gang task force in France!

922
01:06:09,166 --> 01:06:11,000
Yeah!

923
01:06:12,708 --> 01:06:14,416
You're all heroes, of course,

924
01:06:14,500 --> 01:06:16,125
and in your own way,

925
01:06:16,208 --> 01:06:18,916
but this fucking guy went in there
with balls this big!

926
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:21,708
Yass, don't ever do that again,
you fearless bastard!

927
01:06:25,750 --> 01:06:29,375
Eat, drink,
but go easy on the drugs tonight, OK?

928
01:06:35,166 --> 01:06:37,125
Yeah. Yeah!

929
01:06:37,208 --> 01:06:38,500
Thank you, Greg.

930
01:06:38,583 --> 01:06:41,291
Thank you.
We couldn't have done this without you.

931
01:06:44,333 --> 01:06:47,041
Come on, let's have some fun. Yes!

932
01:06:52,125 --> 01:06:54,875
North BAC! North BAC!

933
01:06:54,958 --> 01:06:57,208
We're here because of you, brother.

934
01:06:57,291 --> 01:06:58,625
All you, brother.

935
01:06:59,875 --> 01:07:02,000
Nobody stabbed me in the back to get here.

936
01:07:05,166 --> 01:07:06,166
Yeah.

937
01:07:11,875 --> 01:07:12,750
Come on!

938
01:07:13,833 --> 01:07:14,875
I'm tired.

939
01:07:16,250 --> 01:07:17,291
But I'm happy!

940
01:07:30,041 --> 01:07:31,000
'Sup?

941
01:07:32,833 --> 01:07:33,833
Let's see…

942
01:07:35,333 --> 01:07:36,375
Boom!

943
01:07:40,250 --> 01:07:41,291
All good?

944
01:07:42,333 --> 01:07:43,416
Put it in your trunk?

945
01:07:58,208 --> 01:07:59,125
So it is.

946
01:08:01,291 --> 01:08:02,666
What are you gonna do?

947
01:08:03,166 --> 01:08:06,250
I'll probably smoke it all myself.

948
01:08:08,458 --> 01:08:09,833
Another life, I'd join you.

949
01:08:14,333 --> 01:08:16,250
So this is the end of the road.

950
01:08:17,625 --> 01:08:18,833
This is it, yeah.

951
01:08:20,583 --> 01:08:23,208
So you're finally getting rid of me.

952
01:08:27,041 --> 01:08:29,000
All right.

953
01:08:30,833 --> 01:08:32,166
Take care of yourself.

954
01:08:35,708 --> 01:08:36,625
Hey…

955
01:08:38,583 --> 01:08:39,791
See you around, Amel.

956
01:08:45,666 --> 01:08:46,750
Hey, Antoine…

957
01:08:48,208 --> 01:08:49,041
What?

958
01:08:50,208 --> 01:08:51,958
-Never mind, it's fine.
-What?

959
01:08:52,041 --> 01:08:53,958
Nothing, it's fine. Get outta here.

960
01:08:56,833 --> 01:08:59,375
Don't get fresh
or you'll end up in the water!

961
01:09:06,375 --> 01:09:08,916
Go on. Get out of here.

962
01:09:30,041 --> 01:09:32,541
TWO MONTHS LATER

963
01:09:43,416 --> 01:09:44,916
Hey, bubba.

964
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:47,166
Who's my little buddy? You my buddy?

965
01:09:47,250 --> 01:09:48,375
We're buddies, right?

966
01:10:02,958 --> 01:10:04,541
-Sergeant Cerva?
-Yes.

967
01:10:05,208 --> 01:10:06,458
Lieutenant Vidal.

968
01:10:26,458 --> 01:10:27,625
What's going on?

969
01:10:28,291 --> 01:10:29,125
Yass?

970
01:10:30,666 --> 01:10:32,250
-Where's the baby?
-Inside.

971
01:10:32,916 --> 01:10:34,416
I'll call you when I'm done.

972
01:10:38,041 --> 01:10:40,250
What the hell is this mess?
Are you kidding?

973
01:10:40,333 --> 01:10:42,416
-You don't have to do this! Why?
-Hey, calm down.

974
01:10:42,500 --> 01:10:44,375
-Where's my son?
-Take it down a notch.

975
01:10:44,458 --> 01:10:47,958
Everything's fine. He's in the bedroom.
We need to check the cupboards.

976
01:10:50,708 --> 01:10:52,375
Emilien, check under the TV.

977
01:10:53,750 --> 01:10:54,583
Shit!

978
01:10:57,416 --> 01:10:59,083
Come, my love. Huh?

979
01:10:59,166 --> 01:11:00,625
-He's fine.
-Are you OK?

980
01:11:01,416 --> 01:11:02,458
Please leave.

981
01:11:04,583 --> 01:11:06,291
Are you OK, my love? Huh?

982
01:11:06,375 --> 01:11:08,458
-Go along the closets.
-Sweetie.

983
01:11:08,541 --> 01:11:09,875
Hey.

984
01:11:09,958 --> 01:11:11,125
Mommy's here now.

985
01:11:28,375 --> 01:11:30,166
I have to inform you
that this interview

986
01:11:30,250 --> 01:11:33,375
will be recorded on video
for further use in the investigation.

987
01:11:33,458 --> 01:11:36,875
Let me introduce myself.
I'm Lieutenant Yvon. IGPN.

988
01:11:36,958 --> 01:11:39,666
Great. What the hell am I doing here?
I'd like to know.

989
01:11:40,583 --> 01:11:42,041
Well, the charges are…

990
01:11:44,666 --> 01:11:45,500
…racketeering…

991
01:11:47,625 --> 01:11:49,083
…and organized drug trafficking.

992
01:11:53,166 --> 01:11:57,250
-Are you kidding? Is this a joke?
-No, I don't think it's a joke.

993
01:11:57,750 --> 01:12:00,791
Well? The cannabis,
who did you steal it from?

994
01:12:00,875 --> 01:12:02,000
We didn't steal it.

995
01:12:02,750 --> 01:12:04,500
-You didn't steal it?
-No.

996
01:12:04,583 --> 01:12:06,458
-We collected it.
-"Collected"?

997
01:12:08,708 --> 01:12:11,583
That's a nice way of putting it.
I like it. "Collected."

998
01:12:14,541 --> 01:12:16,000
Police exhibit number four.

999
01:12:18,125 --> 01:12:19,958
Kept a few sticks of cannabis
for yourself,

1000
01:12:20,041 --> 01:12:22,375
which we found in your home, to get high?

1001
01:12:23,666 --> 01:12:25,291
I smoke cannabis, yes.

1002
01:12:25,916 --> 01:12:28,125
So, this is for your personal consumption?

1003
01:12:28,208 --> 01:12:29,333
I just said so.

1004
01:12:30,750 --> 01:12:31,708
Didn't you hear me?

1005
01:12:31,791 --> 01:12:34,541
And, uh, how do you explain the presence

1006
01:12:35,166 --> 01:12:36,291
of this scale?

1007
01:12:38,291 --> 01:12:42,541
Do you know a lot of potheads
who weigh their dope? I don't know any.

1008
01:12:43,916 --> 01:12:45,166
Only dealers do that.

1009
01:12:45,958 --> 01:12:47,375
We never sold any drugs.

1010
01:12:48,375 --> 01:12:50,458
-Never.
-You didn't sell any drugs.

1011
01:12:50,541 --> 01:12:53,375
No. Drugs were our bargaining chip.
Drugs in exchange for information.

1012
01:12:53,458 --> 01:12:55,416
-That's not what people are saying.
-Oh?

1013
01:12:56,166 --> 01:12:58,041
Please tell me what people are saying.

1014
01:12:58,125 --> 01:13:01,500
They say you confiscate drugs
then turn around and sell them.

1015
01:13:03,375 --> 01:13:05,625
The drugs were used

1016
01:13:05,708 --> 01:13:10,083
to pay the informant who told us
about the distributing apartment.

1017
01:13:10,166 --> 01:13:13,125
An informant whose identity
is completely unknown to you.

1018
01:13:13,208 --> 01:13:14,250
Only Antoine knows.

1019
01:13:14,333 --> 01:13:17,875
The informant wanted to remain anonymous.
It's what they do. But you know that.

1020
01:13:17,958 --> 01:13:19,041
Of course.

1021
01:13:19,125 --> 01:13:20,375
I'm not telling you shit.

1022
01:13:20,958 --> 01:13:23,500
-Zero.
-And for what reason are you refusing?

1023
01:13:23,583 --> 01:13:24,666
You can't be serious?

1024
01:13:24,750 --> 01:13:26,833
If I give you my informant,
that puts them at risk.

1025
01:13:27,916 --> 01:13:30,833
-I promised to keep them anonymous.
-Yes, of course.

1026
01:13:30,916 --> 01:13:33,583
You gave your word so you're keeping it.
You're not a snitch.

1027
01:13:33,666 --> 01:13:35,375
-Is that it?
-Exactly, that's it.

1028
01:13:36,333 --> 01:13:37,583
That's how thugs operate.

1029
01:13:39,375 --> 01:13:40,583
Go fuck yourself.

1030
01:13:41,166 --> 01:13:43,208
I didn't catch the informant's name.

1031
01:13:43,291 --> 01:13:46,125
I'm not telling you anything.
There are ethics to being a cop.

1032
01:13:46,208 --> 01:13:48,708
-Oh.
-You don't look like you have any. Huh?

1033
01:13:50,583 --> 01:13:52,458
Trying to take down your colleagues.

1034
01:13:52,541 --> 01:13:53,625
You have a child?

1035
01:13:54,875 --> 01:13:57,291
-Yeah.
-Some things are understandable.

1036
01:13:57,375 --> 01:14:00,166
When you have a kid, 1,800 euros a month…

1037
01:14:00,250 --> 01:14:03,208
-Risking your life every day.
-What are you trying to say?

1038
01:14:03,291 --> 01:14:05,375
I think that the drugs,

1039
01:14:05,458 --> 01:14:08,208
you sold them because you need help
making ends meet.

1040
01:14:08,291 --> 01:14:10,208
Quit talking out of your ass
with your bullshit!

1041
01:14:10,291 --> 01:14:13,125
Why are you bringing my son into this
with that shitty condescending tone?

1042
01:14:13,208 --> 01:14:15,625
-You need help making ends meet--
-Think you're better than me?

1043
01:14:15,708 --> 01:14:18,500
-Anyone could understand.
-You think you're better?

1044
01:14:20,958 --> 01:14:23,125
-You think I'm dirty, don't you?
-No.

1045
01:14:23,208 --> 01:14:25,958
If you want me not to think that,
you have to give me something.

1046
01:14:26,458 --> 01:14:28,666
Quit looking at me like that. OK?

1047
01:14:29,333 --> 01:14:31,166
You quit looking at me like that.

1048
01:14:31,250 --> 01:14:33,333
-I've been doing this job 20 years.
-Yeah?

1049
01:14:33,416 --> 01:14:35,750
OK? Think you're
on the right side of the desk?

1050
01:14:35,833 --> 01:14:38,041
You think you know everything,
but you don't!

1051
01:14:38,125 --> 01:14:39,833
-I'm doing my job.
-You don't know anything!

1052
01:14:39,916 --> 01:14:42,750
You don't know what we went through,
don't know the northern sector!

1053
01:14:42,833 --> 01:14:45,916
You've never set foot there!
You're just a fucking bureaucrat!

1054
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:48,125
-You should--
-We almost died out there!

1055
01:14:48,208 --> 01:14:50,166
-You should calm down.
-Seen the poverty out there?

1056
01:14:50,250 --> 01:14:52,291
You ain't seen nothing!
Get down from that high horse.

1057
01:14:52,375 --> 01:14:54,791
-I'm giving you a piece of advice.
-Don't take that tone. Fuck.

1058
01:14:54,875 --> 01:14:56,708
-I'm giving you… Calm down!
-Shut up!

1059
01:14:56,791 --> 01:14:57,875
-Shut your mouth!
-Calm down.

1060
01:14:57,958 --> 01:15:01,625
-I ask the questions, you answer them!
-I'm done talking to you! I'm done!

1061
01:15:01,708 --> 01:15:04,541
-Then who will you talk to?
-You want to lock me up, huh?

1062
01:15:04,625 --> 01:15:07,041
That way you can meet your quota,
you puny little man!

1063
01:15:07,125 --> 01:15:11,375
I know this story by heart. I know it by
heart! You wanna meet your quota!

1064
01:15:11,458 --> 01:15:14,458
-There! I'm done talking to you.
-Calm down! Calm down.

1065
01:15:14,541 --> 01:15:17,291
-It's pointless. You're just an asshole!
-It's in your best interest.

1066
01:15:17,375 --> 01:15:19,916
Go fuck yourself!
Now I wanna talk to my superior.

1067
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:22,916
I wanna talk to Jérôme!
I'm not saying another word!

1068
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:26,375
You're not talking to anyone!
We already talked to your superior.

1069
01:15:26,458 --> 01:15:29,166
Know what? Jérôme doesn't know
anything about your informant!

1070
01:15:29,250 --> 01:15:30,875
-You made it up!
-Oh, he doesn't?

1071
01:15:30,958 --> 01:15:34,041
Hey, moron. You imbecile!
My superior is my friend!

1072
01:15:34,125 --> 01:15:36,750
We did this mission together!
He gave the order!

1073
01:15:36,833 --> 01:15:38,208
-Oh, right!
-You're fucked!

1074
01:15:38,291 --> 01:15:39,500
You are fucked!

1075
01:15:39,583 --> 01:15:41,916
-You should be careful with your friends.
-I'm done talking!

1076
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:45,000
I want an audience
with the prosecutor's office, and Jérôme!

1077
01:15:45,083 --> 01:15:46,000
Keep going.

1078
01:15:46,083 --> 01:15:49,125
I'm done talking to you!
I'm done talking! Go fuck yourself!

1079
01:15:49,208 --> 01:15:50,625
-You better control yourself!
-Hey!

1080
01:15:50,708 --> 01:15:53,416
-Take care of him.
-You should be ashamed!

1081
01:15:53,500 --> 01:15:55,875
-Cuff him.
-You don't know? You know what we did?

1082
01:15:55,958 --> 01:15:57,791
You're nothing now! Nothing!

1083
01:16:27,833 --> 01:16:29,208
Please have a seat.

1084
01:16:30,041 --> 01:16:31,291
Hello, Your Honor.

1085
01:16:32,125 --> 01:16:33,083
So…

1086
01:16:34,041 --> 01:16:37,500
We're here at the request of the accused,
Grégory Cerva.

1087
01:16:37,583 --> 01:16:41,000
He asked to be heard in your presence,
Mr. Jérôme Bodin,

1088
01:16:41,083 --> 01:16:44,041
head of the anti-criminal brigade
of the northern sector.

1089
01:16:45,583 --> 01:16:49,166
Mr. Bodin, while exercising
your duties as an officer,

1090
01:16:49,250 --> 01:16:53,291
were you aware of an operation
being carried out at night by this team,

1091
01:16:53,375 --> 01:16:56,375
in order to collect
various amounts of cannabis hash?

1092
01:16:57,166 --> 01:16:58,291
No, I was not aware.

1093
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:03,000
I'll remind you that you are under oath.

1094
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:06,458
-Do you confirm?
-I confirm.

1095
01:17:06,541 --> 01:17:08,708
-Jérôme, what are you doing?
-No, Mr. Cerva.

1096
01:17:08,791 --> 01:17:11,333
-What are you doing?
-Mr. Cerva! Mr. Cerva!

1097
01:17:12,666 --> 01:17:14,625
You'll be able
to have your say in due time.

1098
01:17:14,708 --> 01:17:16,708
I'll remind you that you are under oath.

1099
01:17:19,083 --> 01:17:20,958
-Do you confirm?
-I confirm.

1100
01:17:22,708 --> 01:17:25,333
You never heard
about this collecting of drugs?

1101
01:17:25,416 --> 01:17:26,375
Never.

1102
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:29,500
Is it possible
that without your knowledge,

1103
01:17:29,583 --> 01:17:32,583
this collecting was used
to pay an informant for information

1104
01:17:32,666 --> 01:17:35,416
used in the operation
that led to the dismantling

1105
01:17:35,500 --> 01:17:37,875
of the drug trafficking network
in question?

1106
01:17:38,791 --> 01:17:40,166
It's… It's possible.

1107
01:17:43,333 --> 01:17:44,833
But I was not aware of it.

1108
01:17:47,541 --> 01:17:48,666
Mr. Cerva,

1109
01:17:48,750 --> 01:17:51,916
you claim that your chain of command
was aware of your actions?

1110
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:53,166
Absolutely.

1111
01:17:54,250 --> 01:17:58,583
You claim that your superior,
present here, had approved your actions?

1112
01:17:58,666 --> 01:17:59,500
Yes.

1113
01:18:01,083 --> 01:18:03,333
Careful now,
is this a direct accusation?

1114
01:18:03,416 --> 01:18:04,250
Yes.

1115
01:18:05,541 --> 01:18:08,000
Do you have
any evidence to present to me?

1116
01:18:10,458 --> 01:18:11,291
No.

1117
01:18:13,041 --> 01:18:13,875
No.

1118
01:18:19,083 --> 01:18:22,416
Thank you, gentlemen.
Mr. Bodin, you may leave.

1119
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:23,958
Thank you.

1120
01:18:34,125 --> 01:18:37,625
You'll be in solitary confinement
during your provisional detention.

1121
01:18:37,708 --> 01:18:40,291
Until the investigation's over.

1122
01:18:40,375 --> 01:18:43,333
You can call your family
in one month. Not before.

1123
01:18:44,041 --> 01:18:45,875
No contact with other inmates.

1124
01:18:45,958 --> 01:18:47,333
It's for your own safety.

1125
01:18:48,083 --> 01:18:50,083
You don't have a lot of friends in here.

1126
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:58,291
Turn to the left.

1127
01:19:00,750 --> 01:19:03,125
Fuck your mother!
Dirty fucking cop!

1128
01:19:03,208 --> 01:19:05,833
Come over here,
son of a bitch! Bitch!

1129
01:19:06,875 --> 01:19:10,583
We're gonna get you!
We're gonna get your ass!

1130
01:19:10,666 --> 01:19:12,875
-You're dirty!
-Stop here.

1131
01:19:12,958 --> 01:19:16,291
We're gonna get you.
We'll get you, scumbag!

1132
01:19:16,375 --> 01:19:17,916
Fucking crook!

1133
01:19:20,708 --> 01:19:23,333
The only person
you'll communicate with is the guard.

1134
01:19:23,416 --> 01:19:25,375
The only way to call him is this.

1135
01:19:26,375 --> 01:19:28,291
We're gonna come for you!

1136
01:19:51,916 --> 01:19:53,583
Hello. Yes. It's just that…

1137
01:19:53,666 --> 01:19:56,958
-What do you want?
-It's just that I need to see you now.

1138
01:19:57,041 --> 01:19:59,500
Not now.
We'll deal with it tomorrow.

1139
01:19:59,583 --> 01:20:01,750
No, it's just
that I need to talk to my captain.

1140
01:20:29,041 --> 01:20:32,458
It's as simple as cutting
out the backbone and roasting it flat.

1141
01:20:32,541 --> 01:20:35,500
Don't bother talking to me.
You hear? That's--

1142
01:20:39,041 --> 01:20:42,958
Good evening. In tonight's headlines,
a scandal with the Marseille police.

1143
01:20:43,041 --> 01:20:46,250
Three BAC employees are suspected
of corruption and extortion.

1144
01:20:46,333 --> 01:20:48,958
They allegedly sold drugs
that had been recovered from thugs

1145
01:20:49,041 --> 01:20:50,291
in exchange for services.

1146
01:20:50,375 --> 01:20:51,791
For several months now,

1147
01:20:51,875 --> 01:20:54,208
investigators had installed microphones
in their vehicles.

1148
01:20:54,291 --> 01:20:57,208
The recorded conversations
don't leave much room for doubt,

1149
01:20:57,291 --> 01:20:58,666
according to the prosecutor.

1150
01:20:58,750 --> 01:21:01,916
This is the unit in charge
of recovering drugs from dealers

1151
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:04,583
and counterfeit cigarettes
from street vendors.

1152
01:21:04,666 --> 01:21:08,750
I will be, as I have had the opportunity
to be in other situations,

1153
01:21:08,833 --> 01:21:12,208
extremely strict regarding these men.

1154
01:21:12,291 --> 01:21:15,458
There is no room
for those who defile the police

1155
01:21:16,291 --> 01:21:17,541
and the Republic.

1156
01:21:17,625 --> 01:21:21,000
Everyone must know
that we will take the strictest…

1157
01:21:21,083 --> 01:21:21,916
Guard!

1158
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:23,291
…possible measures.

1159
01:21:25,041 --> 01:21:28,416
Every time the north BAC
is involved in a procedure, in a case,

1160
01:21:28,500 --> 01:21:30,250
there will be an underlying doubt,

1161
01:21:30,333 --> 01:21:32,666
according to many lawyers
of the Marseille bar.

1162
01:21:32,750 --> 01:21:36,375
And these lawyers are not excluding
requesting release for clients

1163
01:21:36,458 --> 01:21:37,625
who had been brought in

1164
01:21:37,708 --> 01:21:41,916
by these north BAC policemen at the time,
and who are currently incarcerated.

1165
01:21:43,125 --> 01:21:44,375
Today,

1166
01:21:44,458 --> 01:21:48,125
I sense great distress
amongst the population.

1167
01:21:49,125 --> 01:21:52,333
Minister, do you have a plan
for placing this type of unit

1168
01:21:52,416 --> 01:21:55,583
under stricter
and more efficient surveillance?

1169
01:21:57,625 --> 01:21:59,416
Having to directly fight thugs

1170
01:21:59,500 --> 01:22:01,625
requires that much more restraint

1171
01:22:01,708 --> 01:22:04,291
and a sense of republican values.

1172
01:22:04,375 --> 01:22:06,791
And a police officer
who doesn't respect the law

1173
01:22:06,875 --> 01:22:09,000
and the code of ethics of the police

1174
01:22:09,083 --> 01:22:12,000
defiles the uniform and has no place
in Marseille's police…

1175
01:22:12,083 --> 01:22:13,166
Answer me!

1176
01:22:14,125 --> 01:22:16,625
Hey! Answer me!

1177
01:22:16,708 --> 01:22:18,000
Answer me!

1178
01:22:18,083 --> 01:22:19,750
Dammit, answer me!

1179
01:22:20,250 --> 01:22:22,500
-Hey! Hey!
-Thank you.

1180
01:22:22,583 --> 01:22:25,458
-That's a form of corruption.
-Hey! Answer me!

1181
01:22:25,541 --> 01:22:29,208
Most concerning is civil servants seem
to have lost their moral standards.

1182
01:22:30,208 --> 01:22:33,625
The justice department
speaks of a broad criminal investigation

1183
01:22:33,708 --> 01:22:36,833
that's only just getting started.
If the facts are confirmed,

1184
01:22:36,916 --> 01:22:40,458
the police officers could be sentenced
to up to 20 years in prison.

1185
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:42,708
-You all right?
-Yeah.

1186
01:22:42,791 --> 01:22:45,125
Your family gives you money
for the commissary?

1187
01:22:45,208 --> 01:22:46,291
-Yeah, I'm fine.
-OK.

1188
01:22:46,833 --> 01:22:49,833
Listen, I know I'm your lawyer,
but I'm not a miracle worker.

1189
01:22:50,333 --> 01:22:51,875
So far, our defense is frail.

1190
01:22:51,958 --> 01:22:53,291
We don't have much.

1191
01:22:53,375 --> 01:22:56,916
Your problem is that everyone's
gotten involved with this business.

1192
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:59,083
The prefect, the mayor,

1193
01:22:59,166 --> 01:23:01,166
the reporters and the minister too.

1194
01:23:01,875 --> 01:23:03,708
You hear the minister the other day?

1195
01:23:04,208 --> 01:23:06,791
If there's to be a chance
of getting you outta here,

1196
01:23:08,291 --> 01:23:10,208
I need the name of that informant.

1197
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:20,333
No, I can't do that.

1198
01:23:21,125 --> 01:23:22,041
Think about it.

1199
01:23:24,333 --> 01:23:25,375
I can't do that.

1200
01:23:43,416 --> 01:23:44,416
What do you want?

1201
01:23:44,500 --> 01:23:47,333
Ah, my hand really hurts.
I can't even move it.

1202
01:23:47,416 --> 01:23:51,583
-I want to go back to the infirmary.
-Not now. You were there this morning.

1203
01:23:54,125 --> 01:23:57,625
OK. Um, do you know
if my lawyer spoke with my superior?

1204
01:23:57,708 --> 01:24:00,333
-They were meant to meet this morning.
-You're not the only one here.

1205
01:24:00,416 --> 01:24:02,583
You know I got no business being in here.

1206
01:24:03,458 --> 01:24:06,666
-Your colleagues must've explained?
-Stop. I don't need…

1207
01:24:06,750 --> 01:24:08,250
-Know what I need?
-Quit talking to me.

1208
01:24:08,333 --> 01:24:10,958
-I need you to call my superior.
-Get some rest. Sleep.

1209
01:24:11,041 --> 01:24:13,125
-Call him, please.
-I said get some rest!

1210
01:24:13,208 --> 01:24:15,625
-I don't have time to chat.
-I know, but it's for…

1211
01:24:16,333 --> 01:24:17,541
Cerva, stop it!

1212
01:24:17,625 --> 01:24:18,708
Stop it!

1213
01:24:20,375 --> 01:24:22,791
-No, no!
-You asshole. Get it now?

1214
01:24:23,291 --> 01:24:24,541
-Ow!
-Get it?

1215
01:24:24,625 --> 01:24:28,208
I want to see my superior, asshole!
I want to see my superior!

1216
01:24:28,291 --> 01:24:31,041
I want to see my superior!

1217
01:24:31,125 --> 01:24:33,208
I want to talk to my superior!

1218
01:24:34,916 --> 01:24:37,083
I need to talk! I need to talk!

1219
01:24:38,125 --> 01:24:41,833
-I need to talk!
-Hey! What are you doing? Hey, guard!

1220
01:24:41,916 --> 01:24:45,333
I need to talk! I need to talk!

1221
01:24:49,250 --> 01:24:51,458
I need to fucking talk!

1222
01:24:54,875 --> 01:24:56,541
I need to talk!

1223
01:24:57,083 --> 01:24:59,250
I need to fucking talk!

1224
01:24:59,333 --> 01:25:01,875
I need to talk! I need to talk!

1225
01:25:09,916 --> 01:25:13,875
Hi, you've reached Yass and Nora.
We're not home. Leave us a message.

1226
01:25:13,958 --> 01:25:15,291
Yeah, honey, it's me.

1227
01:25:16,291 --> 01:25:17,625
Uh, hope that…

1228
01:25:18,791 --> 01:25:19,791
that you're OK.

1229
01:25:21,333 --> 01:25:22,958
I wanted to call you, so I…

1230
01:25:26,583 --> 01:25:27,416
Uh…

1231
01:25:29,416 --> 01:25:30,416
And Malik, uh…

1232
01:25:42,750 --> 01:25:45,000
Here.
We pitched in what we could.

1233
01:25:46,125 --> 01:25:49,333
I'm touched, but I don't want it.
I want help.

1234
01:25:49,416 --> 01:25:50,833
Yeah, of course. Tell us.

1235
01:25:51,500 --> 01:25:53,458
You guys collected drugs too.

1236
01:25:55,125 --> 01:25:57,583
You need to say something,
tell Internal Affairs.

1237
01:25:57,666 --> 01:26:00,125
It can change this.
It'll give some weight to their version.

1238
01:26:00,208 --> 01:26:03,750
It won't, Nora. It's just gonna put
the three of us in the slammer with them.

1239
01:26:03,833 --> 01:26:05,708
What do you expect from us here?

1240
01:26:05,791 --> 01:26:09,375
They didn't rat you out. They took it all.
They said nothing. Even Greg.

1241
01:26:09,458 --> 01:26:12,041
They'll jump all over us, Nora,
put us in prison.

1242
01:26:12,125 --> 01:26:16,125
You know that if you tell Internal Affairs
that you were there, that Jérôme knew,

1243
01:26:16,208 --> 01:26:18,541
if you tell them what happened
those nights--

1244
01:26:18,625 --> 01:26:20,750
Jérôme did his job. He saved the brigade.

1245
01:26:21,416 --> 01:26:24,583
The ministry's gonna save its own ass
and the police's reputation.

1246
01:26:24,666 --> 01:26:27,416
Greg, Antoine, and Yass
don't mean anything to them.

1247
01:26:27,500 --> 01:26:29,000
Same goes for us if we speak out.

1248
01:26:29,083 --> 01:26:32,000
Know what we're dealing with?
I'm talking five to ten years.

1249
01:26:32,750 --> 01:26:34,958
The lawyer told me, Jacques. He told me.

1250
01:26:38,250 --> 01:26:39,333
I'm begging you.

1251
01:26:45,291 --> 01:26:47,375
What do I tell him? What do I tell Malik?

1252
01:26:47,916 --> 01:26:50,958
I swear, if I could've done something,
I would've done it.

1253
01:26:52,250 --> 01:26:53,416
I have a daughter too.

1254
01:26:55,250 --> 01:26:57,083
Your son could just as well be mine.

1255
01:26:58,583 --> 01:27:00,041
You can't ask me to do this.

1256
01:27:01,083 --> 01:27:02,208
I'm sorry, Nora.

1257
01:27:17,875 --> 01:27:19,083
How are you feeling?

1258
01:27:20,666 --> 01:27:21,708
I'm OK.

1259
01:27:22,500 --> 01:27:25,708
It's kinda annoying. The Jacuzzi
broke down. Apart from that, I'm good.

1260
01:27:29,208 --> 01:27:30,291
It's hard in here.

1261
01:27:33,416 --> 01:27:34,666
You're alone with yourself.

1262
01:27:37,541 --> 01:27:38,958
How's my little man doing?

1263
01:27:39,458 --> 01:27:44,000
Good. Good. He laughs all the time.
I talk to him. They say that's important.

1264
01:27:44,791 --> 01:27:47,458
-I tell him stories.
-What do you say to him?

1265
01:27:49,041 --> 01:27:51,666
-That you're coming home.
-Of course I'm coming home.

1266
01:27:59,791 --> 01:28:01,333
Did you talk to the others?

1267
01:28:02,416 --> 01:28:04,625
Kevin, Jacques… did you talk to them?

1268
01:28:06,541 --> 01:28:07,541
Tell me.

1269
01:28:15,666 --> 01:28:16,750
They won't speak out.

1270
01:28:17,583 --> 01:28:19,000
No.

1271
01:28:24,583 --> 01:28:26,000
-Oh.
-I'm sorry.

1272
01:28:26,083 --> 01:28:27,208
No, it's nothing.

1273
01:28:28,125 --> 01:28:30,000
It happens to me too.

1274
01:28:32,833 --> 01:28:34,000
Malik and I are here.

1275
01:28:34,083 --> 01:28:36,791
Even if we have to wait 112 winters,
we're here.

1276
01:28:36,875 --> 01:28:38,375
I'm here too.

1277
01:28:38,458 --> 01:28:39,833
I'm not going anywhere.

1278
01:28:40,625 --> 01:28:43,000
I'm afraid I don't have a choice.

1279
01:28:43,500 --> 01:28:44,958
I fucking love you.

1280
01:28:48,291 --> 01:28:49,958
-Go on.
-You're my life.

1281
01:28:50,041 --> 01:28:51,625
-You're my life.
-You too.

1282
01:28:54,375 --> 01:28:56,625
-Come on. We gotta go.
-Yeah, I got it, chief.

1283
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:31,166
I'M NOT DEAD

1284
01:30:02,625 --> 01:30:03,708
I'd like a tablet.

1285
01:30:04,375 --> 01:30:07,000
We've been giving you tons of tablets.
It's ridiculous.

1286
01:30:08,250 --> 01:30:09,125
Come on.

1287
01:30:10,708 --> 01:30:12,166
Come on. Try to get up.

1288
01:30:12,250 --> 01:30:14,041
Come on. Come on.

1289
01:30:39,333 --> 01:30:40,291
Hey, bro!

1290
01:30:41,625 --> 01:30:42,458
Hey!

1291
01:30:43,208 --> 01:30:45,333
-Hey!
-This way, come on. Let's go.

1292
01:30:45,416 --> 01:30:46,375
Greg!

1293
01:30:46,458 --> 01:30:48,916
Your cell! Shut up!
Now you're pissing me off!

1294
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:50,500
-Come on!
-Hey!

1295
01:30:50,583 --> 01:30:52,250
-What the fuck? It's me!
-Move it!

1296
01:30:52,333 --> 01:30:54,375
-Hey, what did you do to him?
-Move it!

1297
01:30:55,125 --> 01:30:56,833
OK.

1298
01:30:57,875 --> 01:30:58,875
OK, stop.

1299
01:31:16,833 --> 01:31:18,333
I need to get my hair cut.

1300
01:31:19,750 --> 01:31:22,708
Only inmates can cut other inmates' hair.
It's the law.

1301
01:31:22,791 --> 01:31:23,625
I know.

1302
01:31:24,500 --> 01:31:26,916
I can't leave you in the hands
of just any inmate.

1303
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:28,000
Yeah, I know.

1304
01:31:30,333 --> 01:31:33,875
-You don't think I see you coming?
-I just wanna get my hair cut.

1305
01:31:34,375 --> 01:31:36,375
You can't refuse me that. It's my right.

1306
01:31:41,625 --> 01:31:43,666
I don't wanna hear
a word out of you.

1307
01:31:43,750 --> 01:31:44,750
Got it, chief.

1308
01:32:18,125 --> 01:32:18,958
Chief?

1309
01:32:21,666 --> 01:32:22,875
If you had a friend

1310
01:32:23,666 --> 01:32:26,291
who was losing his mind…

1311
01:32:27,791 --> 01:32:29,125
you'd save him, right?

1312
01:32:29,208 --> 01:32:30,750
I said "not one word."

1313
01:32:31,333 --> 01:32:33,000
I'm talking to you, not him.

1314
01:32:34,041 --> 01:32:36,125
-So, what would you do?
-Shut up.

1315
01:32:36,833 --> 01:32:39,000
-But what would you do?
-Shut up.

1316
01:32:39,083 --> 01:32:40,458
You'd save him, right?

1317
01:32:40,541 --> 01:32:43,000
Would you save him,
or would you let him die like a dog?

1318
01:32:43,083 --> 01:32:45,250
Hey, I saw Greg and he's not there. Fuck!

1319
01:32:45,333 --> 01:32:47,541
Wake up! Wake up now!

1320
01:32:47,625 --> 01:32:49,458
-Do what you have to do.
-Shut up!

1321
01:32:49,541 --> 01:32:51,958
Do what you have to do! Fuck!
He's dying in here!

1322
01:32:52,041 --> 01:32:54,791
-Careful!
-Wake up! Wake up!

1323
01:32:54,875 --> 01:32:55,833
Shut up!

1324
01:34:11,375 --> 01:34:12,458
Is that her?

1325
01:34:13,958 --> 01:34:14,916
Yeah, it's her.

1326
01:34:31,750 --> 01:34:33,000
I didn't have a choice.

1327
01:34:38,458 --> 01:34:39,500
I'm so sorry.

1328
01:35:01,583 --> 01:35:04,875
After confirming
the existence of this informant,

1329
01:35:04,958 --> 01:35:09,166
the prosecutor has decided to drop
the charges of organized drug trafficking.

1330
01:35:10,041 --> 01:35:13,291
Therefore, I am going
to end your provisional detention.

1331
01:35:13,375 --> 01:35:14,666
You'll be getting out.

1332
01:35:15,500 --> 01:35:18,916
There are still charges against you.
Namely, violating the civil code

1333
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:22,083
and taking illegal actions
in the performance of your duties.

1334
01:35:22,166 --> 01:35:25,750
You will have to submit to certain
