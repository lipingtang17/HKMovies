1
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:26,520
<i>Breathe in...</i>

2
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:28,320
<i>...and out.</i>

3
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:35,760
<i>Let the wave of calm</i>
<i>wash over you.</i>

4
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:39,560
<i>Feel your stress melt away.</i>

5
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:44,600
<i>Let go of things</i>
<i>beyond your control.</i>

6
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:50,240
<i>Focus on your breath...</i>

7
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,440
<i>...your heartbeat.</i>

8
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:07,520
<i>Stay present in this moment.</i>

9
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:11,760
<i>Let everything else</i>
<i>just disappear.</i>

10
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:28,800
Hands to heart.

11
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,440
Just wing it through.

12
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:33,400
And warrior.

13
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:39,080
Warrior two.

14
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:41,560
Then reach into the back
of the room, that's right.

15
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,880
Reaching, reaching
into the back of the room.

16
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:45,320
Reach.

17
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:52,000
Side.

18
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,800
Strong over your front half.

19
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:56,640
Bend.

20
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:01,680
All right. Coming through.
You can jump up or walk up.

21
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,520
And inhale.

22
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,840
Your heart is alive.

23
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:11,000
And exhale.

24
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:15,480
Come back to center.

25
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:17,040
Hands to heart.

26
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,600
Feel your body vibrating.

27
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,200
You're all one,...

28
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,520
...you're all here,...

29
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:27,120
...in your body
and in your power.

30
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,360
Thank you for joining me
this morning.

31
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:36,600
May it bring peace
to the rest of your day.

32
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,480
And may the merit
of our practice...

33
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:41,200
...be dedicated to all beings
everywhere.

34
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:43,360
I honor the light in you.

35
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,080
<i>-Namaste.</i>
<i>-Namaste.</i>

36
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,360
I honor the light within you.

37
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,400
<i>-Namaste.</i>
<i>-Namaste.</i>

38
00:02:58,680 --> 00:02:59,800
-That was amazing.
-All right.

39
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,240
Reel it in, teacher's pet.

40
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,480
You're just mad because you can't
even get through the flow.

41
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:06,080
Are you kidding?
I mastered a bunch of poses.

42
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,240
Oh, child's pose doesn't count.

43
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,640
So how was class?

44
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:12,080
It was perfect, as always.

45
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:15,240
I'm sure it was for you,
but I'm wondering about Charlie.

46
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,800
Me? Well, killed it as always.

47
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:19,800
All right, fine.

48
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,120
It kinda killed me.

49
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:24,080
That's right, that's why they
call it a practice, honey.

50
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,720
Don't worry, we'll have your body
cleansed in no time.

51
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:27,840
Thanks, mom.

52
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,960
All right, sweaty. Shall we?

53
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,040
-We shall. Thank you.
-Okay.

54
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,920
You're welcome.
I'll see you soon.

55
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:39,880
<i>Another breath in...</i>

56
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,040
<i>...and out.</i>

57
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,240
<i>Let go.</i>

58
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:50,920
<i>It takes no effort</i>
<i>to simply let go.</i>

59
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,720
Maybe for you.

60
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,520
-Thank you.
-You're home today.

61
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:13,640
-Okay, I'll see you next week.
-See you.

62
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,560
Yeah.

63
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,120
Aunt Amanda.

64
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,480
-Hey.
-Charlie.

65
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:25,520
-Good to see you.
-How are you?

66
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,960
Look at you.

67
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,520
I can't believe you're here.

68
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:33,080
-Hey.
-It's so good to see you.

69
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,600
You, too.

70
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,240
You, too, sis.

71
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:40,480
Autumn crocuses.
Are those for me?

72
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:42,160
Well, you're literally
the only person I know...

73
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,360
...who likes these.

74
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,240
They're beautiful.

75
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:47,480
Let me just wash up,
I've been teaching all morning.

76
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:48,920
But please, come in.

77
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,120
-Take a look around.
-Hey.

78
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,280
Wow, she's really fixed up
the place.

79
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,520
Yeah, you know mom,...

80
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:54,480
...everything
had to be perfect...

81
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:55,840
...for the grand reopening
this weekend.

82
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:58,120
Wanted to give the place
a rebirth.

83
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,920
-Her words, not mine.
-Yeah.

84
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:03,400
Well, speaking of rebirth,
you're like a new man.

85
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:04,320
Thank you.

86
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,920
Last time I saw you, you...

87
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,920
It's okay, I know.
You can say it.

88
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,120
I relapsed.

89
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,360
But I've got three years sober
next week.

90
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,720
-Good for you.
-Thank you.

91
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:14,880
-Oh, I'm proud of you.
-Thanks.

92
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,400
It really ought to do
with my mom.

93
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,800
Ever since I've been back,
she's been keeping an eye on me.

94
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,240
Well, her and Maya.

95
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,080
Maya?

96
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:25,600
Maya is my mom's assistant
slash star pupil...

97
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:27,200
...slash spiritual successor.

98
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,520
The yin to my mom's yang.

99
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:30,200
Oh, and she's my girlfriend.

100
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:31,320
It's her right there.

101
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:35,360
Wow, she certainly seems limber.

102
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:37,520
She's been taking
mom's classes for years.

103
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:38,920
Even before
she started working here.

104
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,040
It's actually how we met.

105
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:41,840
She's so great. Come on.

106
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:44,720
She's smart, she's funny.

107
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:46,720
She helped my mom
renovate this entire place.

108
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,240
Come on, I'll introduce you.

109
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,960
Hey, Maya. Maya.

110
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,280
Maya.

111
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,080
Charlie, oh, my gosh.

112
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,160
You almost gave me
a heart attack.

113
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,160
I couldn't help it.

114
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:02,640
It is my fault, really.

115
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:05,440
I intend to encourage
his juvenile impulses.

116
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,480
I'm Amanda. Lauren's sister.

117
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:11,080
Oh, my gosh.
Why didn't you say so?

118
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,440
Sorry. I'm just really excited.

119
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:14,320
Lauren's told me
so much about you.

120
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:16,960
Social-media consultant,
from New York, right?

121
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,000
Well, I have only been
in New York...

122
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:21,760
...for a few years,
but that's me, yeah.

123
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:24,400
Pretty much the polar opposite
of my tree-hugging sister.

124
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:26,640
Oh, that's okay.
I won't hold it against you.

125
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,440
I was just kidding. Bad joke.

126
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:30,200
Your sister is kind of my hero.

127
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,640
Maya's one
restraining order away...

128
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,200
...from being
a full-fledged stalker.

129
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:36,480
Well, I'm so glad that you
could come out for the reopening.

130
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:38,600
I know Lauren
was really hoping that you would.

131
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:39,800
I wouldn't miss it.

132
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:41,640
Good.
How long are you in town for?

133
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,640
Not sure.
I just finished a campaign,...

134
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:46,640
...so I was thinking of
taking a little time off...

135
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:47,840
...before my next gig.

136
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:51,040
You'd be amazed how easy it is
to sublet in Manhattan.

137
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,320
But it looks like you guys
have been really busy.

138
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,000
I mean,
I barely recognize the place.

139
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:57,080
I know. Can you believe
this is even the same building?

140
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,600
Your parents' health center
was an amazing foundation.

141
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:03,040
And then Lauren's vision just
helped it become fully realized.

142
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:04,320
I'm sure it's a lot to take in...

143
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:06,400
...after being away
for three years, but...

144
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:09,200
What's wrong?

145
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:12,520
-Did I say something?
-No. No, it's nothing.

146
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,960
It's fine, really.

147
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,080
Okay.

148
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:17,160
Why don't we find mom?

149
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,760
We'll give you
the, well, grand tour.

150
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,040
-Great idea.
-All right.

151
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,560
I didn't mean to upset her.

152
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,920
No, don't worry about it.
It's just...

153
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,240
It's a touchy subject is all.

154
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,560
-Okay.
-It's all good.

155
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:28,720
-Okay.
-All right?

156
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:36,720
Ian?

157
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:38,200
Amanda.

158
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:40,000
It's wonderful to see you.

159
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,240
Lauren's been talking about you
nonstop.

160
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:46,520
Welcome to our new
and growing family business.

161
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:50,200
-Hey, kids.
-Hey, pop.

162
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,480
Have you seen mom?

163
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:52,920
We're hoping to give Amanda
the tour.

164
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,400
No, but I'll get
out of your hair.

165
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,240
See you at the house for dinner?

166
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,600
Here we are. Home sweet home.

167
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,600
You updated the house.

168
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:16,880
Business must really be booming.

169
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:19,600
It will be. Just have to pay off
the loans first.

170
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:21,760
Don't worry, we'll more than
make up the difference.

171
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,120
We have big plans.

172
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:24,680
Come on.

173
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:29,000
Remember this room?

174
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,040
Even my old room gets a makeover.

175
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:39,040
Re-gifting my flowers already?

176
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,880
Oh, I thought
it was a nice touch.

177
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:48,760
Simpler times.

178
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,000
After you moved out,...

179
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:53,400
...we figured your bedroom
shouldn't just collect dust.

180
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:57,520
Now it's the perfect getaway
in addition to the guesthouse.

181
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,840
But Charlie
has officially taken that over.

182
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,760
And Maya
has all but moved in, too.

183
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,440
Look, Amanda,...

184
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,840
...if you ever wanted
to take a little break...

185
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,640
...from the East Coast
for a while...

186
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:10,840
I appreciate that.

187
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:12,560
Really, I do.

188
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:15,440
And the sound of being here
for even just a little while...

189
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:17,280
...does sound good, but...

190
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,440
Then what's stopping you?

191
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,360
You work remotely.

192
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:21,400
You don't need to be
across the country.

193
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:22,800
Come home.

194
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:25,880
I don't know
if it would be the best idea.

195
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:28,440
You're still mad at him?

196
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,080
After all these years?

197
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:31,600
Lauren...

198
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:34,520
...I know you never believed me.

199
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,920
And I know you don't wanna think
he had an affair.

200
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,960
I wish I was wrong.

201
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,320
But I know what I saw.

202
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,480
And...

203
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,080
...I'll never forgive Ian.

204
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:52,800
Think about it.

205
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,680
I didn't invite you back here
just for the reopening.

206
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:58,360
Come on,
I wanna show you something.

207
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:02,440
Follow me.

208
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:11,840
I've been learning about
the healing properties of plants.

209
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:14,960
Well, you've always loved
flowers.

210
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:18,720
Well, many are quite medicinal.
They're nature's pharmacy.

211
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:22,600
I miss you.

212
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,560
I want to give us another chance.

213
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:27,520
We were so close.

214
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:30,000
Your entire life was here.

215
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:33,920
Are we gonna throw all that away
just because of a few bad years?

216
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,240
I've missed you, too.

217
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,000
Then, please, come back home.

218
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,960
Let's be a family again.

219
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,120
Do you wanna plant the last one?

220
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,480
-Boo!
-Maya!

221
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,360
-Not cool.
-Yes.

222
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:41,640
Well, that's what you get...

223
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,720
...for that little gong stunt
earlier.

224
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,080
Oh, what's wrong?

225
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:49,400
The baby can dish it,...

226
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,720
-...but he can't take it?
-Okay.

227
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:57,840
Is that better?

228
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:01,720
Good.

229
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:05,560
-I have to get ready for dinner.
-What...?

230
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,280
What am I supposed to do?

231
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,320
Well, you can start
by getting dressed.

232
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:13,280
That's the opposite
of how I thought this was going.

233
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,600
You know,
I couldn't help but notice...

234
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,360
...things have been
a little bit intense...

235
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:17,720
...with Amanda being back.

236
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:18,720
Yeah.

237
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:21,680
Yeah, I know. I was kinda hoping
things between her and my dad...

238
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:23,120
...would've cooled off
by now, but...

239
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:25,080
But not quite so, I see.

240
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,920
Well, from what you told me,
I can't really blame her.

241
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:31,560
Is she still mad at him
for what he did?

242
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,040
Well, what she thinks he did.

243
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:34,920
-Yeah.
-She never did prove it.

244
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,320
Mom doesn't believe it.
Never did.

245
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:39,880
What about you?

246
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:41,840
I don't know.

247
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:46,040
I mean, dad's a charmer.
But cheating on mom? I mean...

248
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:49,160
...whatever Aunt Amanda
thinks he did...

249
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,080
...was enough
to make her leave, so,...

250
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:54,840
...I hope we can all just
put it behind us, start fresh.

251
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:56,600
Me, too.

252
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,680
I just don't wanna see you
get hurt again.

253
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:01,560
Or Lauren.

254
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,080
One thing is for certain.

255
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:06,520
-Dinner's gonna be super awkward.
-Super awkward.

256
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,840
So you better hurry up
and go get dressed.

257
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,480
All right.

258
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,600
I'm not gonna say no
to a lady with a bat.

259
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,600
Amanda, do you like the tofu?

260
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:24,600
This is tofu?

261
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:28,280
-It's great. It's very...
-Chewy?

262
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,200
Hey.

263
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,640
It's Maya's recipe.
She's been cooking for us.

264
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:34,120
In addition to everything else.

265
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:36,280
Yeah, Maya's been a real Godsend.

266
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:42,120
So, I have an announcement.

267
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:46,640
We all know that
the grand reopening...

268
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:48,160
...is just a few days away.

269
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:51,840
It's a big step
for the wellness center.

270
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:54,520
Almost a rebirth.

271
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,880
We're expanding a lot.

272
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,000
And in addition
to all the new services...

273
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,600
...and amenities
we'll be providing,...

274
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:04,000
...Maya and I have been working
on my brand.

275
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:06,480
Reaching more people
outside of the studio.

276
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:09,360
Expanding
my social-media presence.

277
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:13,840
Now, Amanda,
this is your area of expertise.

278
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:16,680
And since you don't currently
have a client,...

279
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:19,560
...I would like to officially
invite you...

280
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,760
...into the fold
as my business partner.

281
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:23,560
-Wait, what?
-Really?

282
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,920
That's awesome, now you can
move back, like, for good.

283
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:27,640
I know it's asking a lot.

284
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,920
But mom and dad
always wanted this...

285
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:31,960
...to be a family business.

286
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:33,840
They left it to the both of us.

287
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:35,440
Lauren, isn't this something...

288
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:36,960
...we should be talking about
in private?

289
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:38,320
I mean, there are other people...

290
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:39,840
...who have a vested interest
in the business,...

291
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:41,720
...people that should have a say.

292
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:43,040
Hey, no offense.

293
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:46,640
We all know
there's a lot of history here,...

294
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:51,160
...but I want to change that
to make things right.

295
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:53,680
The two of you
have nothing to worry about.

296
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:55,840
I'll still need you.
That won't change.

297
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,520
Yeah, I mean, it's your decision.

298
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:00,920
No, it's not. It's our decision.

299
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:03,040
Dad, come on,
this is a good thing.

300
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:04,840
Charlie, will you stay
out of this, all right?

301
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,360
You know what happened last time
that Amanda came here.

302
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,600
-Enough! Enough!
-Really?

303
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:10,840
This is my business.

304
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:12,080
I built it.

305
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,720
I'm the one who took over
the center...

306
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:14,760
...when no one else wanted it,...

307
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,800
...so the only opinions
I'm interested in...

308
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:19,880
...on the subject are mine
and my sister's.

309
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:20,960
Yeah.

310
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:22,800
Yeah.

311
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,000
It's fine.

312
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:27,440
Now, Amanda,...

313
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:30,280
...I don't expect you
to answer right away.

314
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:31,920
Take as long as you need.

315
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:35,120
But just know that you always
have a home here.

316
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:36,760
And nothing
would make me happier...

317
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,600
...than having you back
in our lives.

318
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,080
Okay.

319
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:44,760
I'll think about it.

320
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:46,240
Good.

321
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:49,760
Well, if you'll excuse me.

322
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:00,960
I just don't understand...

323
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,600
...how you couldn't
discuss this with me.

324
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:04,600
It's one thing for her
to come back here for a week.

325
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:06,080
But actually live here?

326
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:07,640
And to own half the business?

327
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:10,000
I am trying to make things right.
She is my sister.

328
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:12,600
-She deserves that much.
-I don't care who she is.

329
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:14,040
You never discussed it.

330
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:15,960
I knew coming back here
was a mistake.

331
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,600
Hey, don't say that.

332
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:19,360
-Oh, like it even matters?
-I'm glad you're here, okay?

333
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:20,960
Thanks, Charlie.

334
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:23,160
Oh, my gosh.
Yeah, just walk away.

335
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:25,640
And I'm sorry
about all this, Maya.

336
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,360
I'm sure Charlie's told you...

337
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:29,560
...about the fallout
the family had before.

338
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,960
Yeah. Yeah, he did.

339
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:35,800
The way they're fighting,
it's almost like you never left.

340
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:40,760
I'm sorry.

341
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:43,160
I didn't mean it.

342
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:47,440
It's just,
Lauren and I have been...

343
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:50,600
...such a great team
the past few months.

344
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:54,560
I'm just a little hurt
she never brought it up to me.

345
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:56,240
That's all.

346
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:58,720
It's okay.

347
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:00,280
I understand.

348
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:03,160
I better get ready for bed.

349
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,080
It's...

350
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:05,840
...the big day tomorrow.

351
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:07,200
-So...
-Yeah.

352
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:08,160
It's a good idea.

353
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,640
-You ready to turn in?
-Oh, no.

354
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:12,800
No, I'm gonna stay up
for a little while.

355
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:16,920
Brew Lauren some herbal tea,
help her relax.

356
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:18,520
I know
it doesn't seem like it,...

357
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:21,560
...but she's really nervous
about the reopening tomorrow.

358
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:25,000
Thank you so much
for taking care of her.

359
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:25,920
Please.

360
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,920
It's the least I can do.
I'd be lost without her, so...

361
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:30,920
Goodnight.

362
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:34,200
All right.
Well, see you in a bit.

363
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,120
Yeah.

364
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,160
Everything okay?

365
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:06,000
Lauren's...

366
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:08,040
...cutting it awful close.

367
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:09,640
Her speech is in five minutes.

368
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:12,960
-Hey. Have you seen mom?
-Hey.

369
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:14,760
-What, she's not back yet?
-No.

370
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:16,880
Last time I saw her, she said...

371
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:18,000
...she was feeling
a little nauseous,...

372
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:19,920
...but that was, like,
a half hour ago.

373
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:21,200
Yeah, she said
she hasn't been feeling well...

374
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:22,440
...the last couple of days.

375
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,720
I think the reopening's
making her a little bit nervous.

376
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:25,960
I'm gonna go check the restroom.

377
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,320
-Yeah.
-I'll go with you.

378
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:33,720
I'll get another tray out
and try to stall.

379
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:35,360
-Okay.
-Thank you, Rebecca.

380
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:45,880
Oh, my gosh. Are you okay?

381
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,920
I'm fine. Just nerves, I guess.

382
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:52,080
Hey, you don't have to do this
if you're not feeling up to it.

383
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:54,200
No, Amanda's right.
I mean, we can postpone.

384
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:55,760
Or I could give the speech
if you want.

385
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:57,880
I mean, I basically memorized it
while I was helping you prep.

386
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:00,440
Oh, no, thank you.

387
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,280
I'm fine.

388
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:04,560
This is everything
that we've been working for.

389
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:05,920
I need to do this.

390
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:09,240
Trust me, I'm fine.
I've got this.

391
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:10,400
Let's go.

392
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:23,720
Good morning, everyone.

393
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:26,960
Thank you so much for coming out
to support us today.

394
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,520
It is my pleasure
to introduce to you...

395
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:31,600
...the woman
responsible for all of this,...

396
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:34,240
...the guru that you all know
and love.

397
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:37,720
Please put your hands together
for Dr. Lauren Birch.

398
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:42,800
Thank you, Maya.

399
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:44,080
As many of you know,...

400
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:45,960
...Maya has been my rock
in all of this.

401
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,400
And this would not have been
possible without her.

402
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,800
When my parents first opened...

403
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:52,960
...the Birch Springs
Family Health Center,...

404
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,400
...they had a very simple
mission in mind.

405
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:57,360
You okay?

406
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:00,320
I'm fine.

407
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:03,080
Sorry, I recently switched
from coffee to tea,...

408
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:05,400
...and my brain
has not forgiven me yet.

409
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:10,760
The mission they began
was to provide the community...

410
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:12,720
...with a center for healing.

411
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:15,760
A place of comfort,
a place of joy.

412
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:20,080
And that's a mission I've strived
to live up to my entire...

413
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,280
-Lauren, Lauren, you okay?
-Mom. Mom.

414
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:25,840
Lauren?

415
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:27,240
-Mom.
-Lauren!

416
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:28,320
-Lauren?
-Lauren?

417
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:29,480
-You okay?
-Lauren!

418
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,320
-Lauren, you okay?
-Mom.

419
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:33,640
Lauren, Lauren?

420
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:35,640
Somebody call 911!

421
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,160
-Mom.
-Lauren. Lauren?

422
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,960
Lauren? Lauren!

423
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:57,600
We will all remember
her warmth...

424
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,280
...her sense of humor...

425
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,000
...and her caring spirit.

426
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:07,440
And her spirit will endure.

427
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:10,840
What she's built
is a testament...

428
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:13,120
...to who she was.

429
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:16,520
Her mission was to heal.

430
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:22,080
Lauren cared about the health,
personal growth of others,...

431
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:23,760
...almost more than herself.

432
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:26,760
That compassion
is what I loved about her.

433
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,560
That's what we all loved
about her.

434
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:31,600
She's left a hole in me.

435
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:34,080
She would want us to heal.

436
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,400
And right now
I'm in dire need of healing.

437
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:40,000
I think we all are.

438
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,080
Thank you all for coming today
to Lauren's celebration.

439
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:55,560
She would've loved that.

440
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,320
I'm so sorry, Amanda.

441
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,960
Josh? Josh Stone?

442
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:28,880
-I haven't seen you since...
-High school.

443
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:30,120
Yeah.

444
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:31,400
You doing okay?

445
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:35,560
Spent the entire past week
crying.

446
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:38,280
So I just, I feel like
I don't have any tears left.

447
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:40,160
Well...

448
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:42,560
Just in case.

449
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:47,240
It's just so bizarre.

450
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:50,360
Lauren was one of the healthiest
people I know to...

451
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:53,320
...she just collapse
like that,...

452
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:55,280
...I mean, from heart failure?

453
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:56,800
Yeah, I know.

454
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,480
It doesn't make sense.

455
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:12,320
When was the last time
you saw Lauren?

456
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:14,960
I'm sorry,
I don't mean to be rude.

457
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,680
It's just, I wasn't expecting
my high school boyfriend...

458
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:19,560
...to be at her memorial.

459
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:21,880
Lauren and I actually reconnected
a few years ago.

460
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:23,600
You did?

461
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:26,040
Yeah, someone broke
into the center,...

462
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:27,280
...vandalized the place.

463
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,160
She came down to the station
to give a statement,...

464
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,040
...and I bumped into her there.

465
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:33,640
The station? What, you're a cop?

466
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:35,480
Detective, actually.

467
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:36,680
Homicide.

468
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:41,920
I'll let you be.

469
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:45,160
I just wanted to express
my condolences.

470
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:48,440
Anything I can do to help,
even if it's just to talk...

471
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:50,160
...don't hesitate to call.

472
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:53,320
Thanks, Josh.

473
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:56,200
Oh, can you do me a favor?

474
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,280
Can you let Ian know
that it'll be a few days...

475
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:00,280
...before the toxicology report
comes back?

476
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:03,240
The toxicology report? What?

477
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:06,560
Yeah, the autopsy
didn't give us much info...

478
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:07,720
...beyond heart failure,...

479
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:09,800
...so the lab performed
a toxicology report.

480
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:12,400
Which, it's standard
in a case like this,...

481
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:14,760
...to help identify
the cause of death...

482
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:17,480
...and possibly identify
any contaminants in the system.

483
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:20,040
Ian was anxious
to hear the results.

484
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:22,560
Yeah, no, of course.
I'll let him know.

485
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:23,480
Yeah.

486
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:25,240
Thank you.

487
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:37,920
I'm sorry for your loss.

488
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:39,440
-Thanks.
-Of course.

489
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:41,680
-I appreciate it.
-Thanks for having me. Take care.

490
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:42,600
Thank you.

491
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:53,560
What a disaster.

492
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:55,920
Charlie making
a complete arse out of himself.

493
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:57,680
Three years sober, gone.

494
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:59,240
What do you expect?

495
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:01,560
He's a recovering addict.
And his mother just died.

496
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:02,960
Yeah, of course,
you'd defend him.

497
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:06,000
Are you kidding me? You're really
bringing this up now?

498
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:09,000
She's gone, Amanda.

499
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:11,440
We don't have to pretend
to get along anymore.

500
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:14,280
Even though I know you still
blame me for what happened.

501
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,160
I'm gonna go check on Charlie.

502
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:19,920
Of course, I blame you.

503
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:21,160
You cheated on her.

504
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:23,360
How many times
do I have to tell you?

505
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:25,200
Nothing happened.

506
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:26,960
It's all in your head.

507
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,240
Lauren understood that.
Why can't you?

508
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:32,280
I know what I saw, and so do you.

509
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:34,280
You and that girl
at the studio,...

510
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:35,640
...when you thought no one
was looking.

511
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:37,720
My gosh, would you just
let it go?

512
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,440
Lauren is dead.

513
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:42,920
Do you really need
to keep ruining our lives?

514
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:47,080
-You think I ruined your life?
-Of course, I do!

515
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:49,680
You nearly ended my marriage,...

516
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:51,600
...you sank our business,...

517
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:53,080
...tore our family apart...

518
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:54,720
...by pushing Charlie back
into using...

519
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:57,480
...and abandoning your sister
when things got too difficult.

520
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:59,800
So, yeah,
I think you ruined our lives.

521
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:09,520
I'm just...

522
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,400
...tired, Amanda.

523
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:16,600
I just lost the only person
I've ever loved,...

524
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:19,840
...and I don't have the strength
to keep fighting with you. So...

525
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:22,760
...if you need to believe
that I had an affair...

526
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:24,000
...to make me a monster...

527
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:26,400
...then go ahead.

528
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:27,920
Just...

529
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:30,440
...do it someplace else.

530
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:34,800
Our family doesn't need you
destroying it anymore.

531
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:40,000
Why are you so interested
in that toxicology report?

532
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,960
I ran into Josh Stone
at the memorial.

533
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:45,400
He said you were anxiously
awaiting the results.

534
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:48,120
What exactly are you implying?

535
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:53,560
I wanna know how my wife died...

536
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:55,720
...because it doesn't make
any sense.

537
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,160
I want answers...

538
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:00,320
...closure.

539
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
I'd expect you, of all people,
to understand that.

540
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:47,280
Oh, Charlie.

541
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:53,280
Hey, Charlie.

542
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:12,720
Okay.

543
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,840
I'm sorry you had
to see me like this.

544
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:18,040
It's okay.
Don't even think about it.

545
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:19,320
All right?

546
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,640
She would've hated me today.

547
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:25,720
No, she wouldn't have.

548
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:32,240
She would've been
worried about you,...

549
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:34,920
...but she would have loved you.

550
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:37,200
She always has and...

551
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:39,320
...she always will.

552
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:44,360
-I'm such a mess-up.
-No, don't say that.

553
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:47,400
Look, we all have
our weaknesses, okay?

554
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:49,560
And, and you've been
through a lot.

555
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:52,480
Look, we're gonna beat this.

556
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:53,800
Okay?

557
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:57,160
This, this is just
your way of showing grief.

558
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:58,800
You know?

559
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:01,880
Ian's way of showing grief
is yelling at people.

560
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:05,440
I mean...

561
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:07,560
...and which I understand,
you know?

562
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:11,160
I wish I could yell at someone.

563
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:19,240
But, but Maya?

564
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:25,440
I guess I can't expect her
to feel the sadness...

565
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:27,080
...the same way we do, but...

566
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:33,800
...she posted this strange
message on the website today...

567
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:36,480
...and then linked it
to the home page and...

568
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:39,680
...it was just so weird.

569
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:44,680
It was like she was using
Lauren's death for publicity.

570
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:48,000
I...

571
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:00,520
There we go.

572
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:12,320
Goodnight, Charlie.

573
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:15,280
We're gonna beat this, I promise.

574
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,080
Maya, you, you scared
the heck out of me.

575
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:26,360
Sorry about that.

576
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:27,960
I didn't wanna interrupt.

577
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:30,400
How long have you been
standing there?

578
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:31,520
Well, not long.

579
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:36,560
Amanda, I can't imagine
how hard this must be for you.

580
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:39,440
Lauren was like family to me,
but you're her sister.

581
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,440
And I'm so, so sorry.

582
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:46,040
Thank you.

583
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:48,720
Just know,
anything you need, I'm here.

584
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:51,760
And whatever you decide,
we'll understand.

585
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:53,720
Now that Lauren's gone,
nobody's expecting you...

586
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:54,640
...to help at the center,...

587
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:57,360
...Ian and I can take over
so that you can have your space.

588
00:30:57,560 --> 00:30:59,440
Well, I appreciate that.

589
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:03,880
But I'm not gonna be leaving.

590
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:05,680
Not again.

591
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:07,360
Really?

592
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:11,080
I need to make sure
that Charlie's taken care of...

593
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:14,360
...and, I need to know the truth.

594
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:16,640
About what?

595
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:19,120
About how my sister really died.

596
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,440
I refuse to believe
she had heart failure.

597
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:28,160
And there's something
that just doesn't make sense.

598
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:31,240
And I'm not leaving
until I know what it is.

599
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:33,040
Well, I think that's wonderful.

600
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,320
And if you want to help us
carry on Lauren's work,...

601
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:38,200
...we'd love to have you.

602
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:42,040
-Okay, then.
-Okay.

603
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:44,280
-Goodnight.
-Goodnight.

604
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:48,000
-Busy morning?
-Amanda.

605
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:50,920
Maya said you might be
joining us today.

606
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:54,320
I figured since I'm here, I might
as well keep an eye on things.

607
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:55,760
It's what Lauren wanted.

608
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:57,800
I guess it doesn't matter
what anyone else wants.

609
00:32:58,040 --> 00:32:59,560
Not in the slightest.

610
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:02,800
Hope I didn't ruin your day.

611
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:11,320
Amanda. Hey.

612
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:13,040
-Hey.
-You came.

613
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:14,080
Yeah.

614
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:16,440
Well, so does this mean that
you're gonna stay...

615
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:17,360
...and help us out?

616
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:18,920
I am.

617
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:20,920
Whatever you need. For Lauren.

618
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:22,200
That's so great.

619
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:24,960
I'm sure she's
smiling down on you.

620
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:28,400
Huh, pretty good
first day so far?

621
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:30,480
Better than expected.

622
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:32,400
I was worried
that closing down for a week...

623
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:34,600
...would cause us
to lose some steam, but...

624
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,080
People really wanted
to support Lauren.

625
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:40,360
Word must have
gotten out somehow.

626
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:45,720
Yeah, even from the afterlife
she's bringing people together.

627
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:50,320
Pretty amazing, isn't it?

628
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:53,520
You okay?

629
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:55,400
Yeah, I just...

630
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:56,880
Sorry, I...

631
00:33:57,320 --> 00:33:59,040
It just feels wrong
for anything good...

632
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:01,440
...to come out of such
a tragedy, you know?

633
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:02,800
I know.

634
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:06,560
But you would have had
a good turnout regardless, right?

635
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:09,400
It's what you both
worked so hard for.

636
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:12,080
Yeah. It's not just that though,
you know?

637
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:14,040
-It's the money and...
-The money?

638
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:17,000
Yeah, you know,
Lauren's life-insurance policy.

639
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:18,960
It's gonna help
repay the loans...

640
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,920
...and it's gonna help expedite
further expansion,...

641
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:23,040
...or whatever, I don't know.

642
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:24,880
That's what Ian's saying, anyway.

643
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:26,800
Ian said that?

644
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:29,720
Yeah. Please don't tell him
that I told you that.

645
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:32,160
I mean, he has a hard-enough time
talking about it as it is.

646
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:33,440
I'm sorry,...

647
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:36,200
...I should not have unloaded
on you like that.

648
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:37,960
No. No, it's fine.

649
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,400
Really, I'm, I'm happy
to talk if you need to.

650
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:41,720
Thank you.

651
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:45,480
Well, I better go. Another class
is starting in 10 minutes.

652
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:46,400
So...

653
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:59,160
<i>-Stone. Yeah.</i>
-Josh?

654
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,280
Hey, it's Amanda.

655
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:02,280
<i>-Amanda...</i>
-Are you free to grab a coffee?

656
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:03,200
<i>Okay.</i>

657
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:05,600
In my line of work,
it's easy to jump to conclusions.

658
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:08,240
-But trust me, it doesn't help.
-Unless I'm right.

659
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:09,160
Amanda...

660
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:11,480
...this hasn't been
ruled a homicide.

661
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,560
It's still unclear. To...

662
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,000
...accuse someone
of murder at this point...

663
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:16,360
Yeah, somebody with motive.

664
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:17,560
You really think
the insurance money...

665
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:19,120
...is enough for Ian
to kill his wife?

666
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:21,640
Sure, I mean,
if he didn't really love her.

667
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:26,960
All right, look, Amanda,
Lauren told me...

668
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,280
...about what you thought
happened.

669
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:32,640
That you accused Ian of cheating,
that it tore the family apart.

670
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:36,040
Lauren didn't believe it.

671
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:38,240
I'm inclined to agree with her.

672
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:40,000
Which leaves Ian with no motive.

673
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:43,880
Are you okay?

674
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:49,560
It just always really hurt when
Lauren believed Ian and not me.

675
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,480
Now it hurts even more.

676
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:56,320
Can I get you two fresh cups?

677
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:59,000
-Yeah, please.
-Yeah, that would be great.

678
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,000
I'm glad you called me,

679
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:07,600
even if your motives were...

680
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:09,720
...to throw your brother-in-law
under the bus.

681
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:14,040
I'm surprised you didn't ask me
about the toxicology report.

682
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:15,840
I assumed that's why
you wanted to meet.

683
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:17,320
What do you mean?

684
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:18,920
Oh, they didn't tell you?

685
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:20,960
Oh, I dropped it off
at the center this morning.

686
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:23,160
No, nobody told me.
What did it say?

687
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:26,600
The lab found a substance
in Lauren's bloodstream.

688
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:29,480
It's possible it could've
contributed to her heart failure.

689
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:30,400
What?

690
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:32,040
Have you ever heard
of colchicine?

691
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:34,000
No.

692
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:38,120
I'm doing this
as a favor for a friend.

693
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:39,440
For Lauren.

694
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:41,880
This is not
an investigation, okay?

695
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:43,920
-Okay.
-All right.

696
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:45,720
Right.

697
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:47,520
So...

698
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:50,240
...colchicine is a natural drug.

699
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:52,040
Completely legal, mind you.

700
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:55,240
"It's often found
as a white power in tablets.

701
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:58,040
It's used to treat
inflammation, gout...

702
00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:00,760
...and familial
Mediterranean fever."

703
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:03,520
Which is a real thing
according to Wikipedia.

704
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:07,280
So it's possible Lauren
was taking this medication...

705
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:08,760
...to treat some of those
symptoms,...

706
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:09,840
...got the dosage wrong.

707
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:13,200
Because if too much is taken,
it can be deadly.

708
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:18,800
Wait, those flowers,
they were Lauren's favorite.

709
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:20,600
I mean, she plants them
in her garden.

710
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:21,840
That's right.

711
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:24,400
It's also the source
of colchicine.

712
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:26,880
Which gives credence
to the theory...

713
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:28,240
...that she was
self-medicating,...

714
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:30,440
...and maybe her death
was an accident.

715
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:33,000
But Lauren wasn't reckless.

716
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:34,800
That's the only theory
we have at this point.

717
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:36,040
No, the only thing I'm hearing...

718
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:38,000
...is that somebody could have
poisoned my sister,

719
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:39,760
...and the police aren't even
considering it.

720
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:43,640
Amanda, if this is all we have,
it doesn't prove anything.

721
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:47,040
I promise you, as soon as
something suspicious arises,

722
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:49,640
I will let you know, okay?

723
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:53,960
Amanda. Come on...

724
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:10,360
Charlie?

725
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:14,400
Charlie?

726
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:17,800
Charlie?

727
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:21,280
Charl...Charlie!

728
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:22,480
Charlie!

729
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:23,760
Charlie!

730
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:26,240
Oh, gosh. Oh, thank gosh.

731
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:27,960
What, what's going on?

732
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:29,800
Thank gosh. I...
I came here to check on you.

733
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:32,200
And when I saw you lying here,
I thought you were...

734
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:33,880
-Oh, gosh.
-I'm fine.

735
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:36,800
No, Charlie, you're not.

736
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:38,040
What are you doing?

737
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:41,160
Relax, it's just a bit of pills.
You're not my mom.

738
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:43,520
Honey...

739
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:26,960
Hey. Do you have a minute?

740
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:28,360
Yeah.

741
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:29,840
Is everything okay?

742
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:32,600
I'm fine, thanks. What's up?

743
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,680
I just ran into Charlie.

744
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:36,640
Can we talk?

745
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:38,560
Sure.

746
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:42,840
I haven't seen him this bad
in a really long time.

747
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:45,200
He even had to call his sponsor.

748
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:49,960
You've seen Charlie
relapse before?

749
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:53,360
To this extent, only once,
when we first met,...

750
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:55,440
...but that was three years ago.

751
00:39:57,240 --> 00:39:58,440
When I left.

752
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:03,120
It seems like whenever
I'm here, Charlie slips.

753
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:04,640
No, don't say that.

754
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:06,880
This is nobody's fault
but Charlie's.

755
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:09,120
You can't blame yourself
for his addiction.

756
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:13,240
Lauren would've said that.

757
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:17,360
I, I spoke with
Detective Stone earlier.

758
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:19,120
He said he was
by the center this morning...

759
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:21,080
...to drop off
a toxicology report?

760
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:24,080
Yeah, he did. He gave it to Ian.
Did you guys learn anything?

761
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:26,920
He said there was something
in Lauren's system.

762
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:29,160
It's a drug called colchicine.

763
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:30,840
You take it for inflammation.

764
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,840
But if you take too much of it,
then it can be fatal.

765
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:35,880
And he thinks
she was taking that?

766
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:37,480
That's the theory.

767
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:40,760
Apparently, it comes from
those flowers that she grows.

768
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:43,680
Somehow, she took too much.

769
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:47,600
And the evidence suggests
that it was an accident.

770
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:49,560
But you don't believe that.

771
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:51,680
It's just, Lauren was
always so careful...

772
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:53,440
...about what she put
in her system.

773
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:57,280
You know, I just, I can't see her
being that reckless.

774
00:40:57,560 --> 00:40:58,520
So what does this mean?

775
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:00,640
You think somebody else
did this to her?

776
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:01,720
I don't know,

777
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:03,920
but...

778
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:06,440
...I have suspicions.

779
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:08,960
That the drugs could have
come from someone else.

780
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:13,600
You don't think that
Charlie would've...

781
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:14,840
I don't think that
he would ever do...

782
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:16,720
...anything intentionally
to hurt her.

783
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:19,000
That's not what I'm saying.
It's just...

784
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:20,560
-Yeah.
-When I saw him earlier,...

785
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:24,200
...he was, he was so out of it
and so confused and...

786
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:27,120
...you know, what if
somehow he relapsed...

787
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:29,640
...before her death
and none of us noticed?

788
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:31,920
And he just got
the drugs mixed up...

789
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:33,640
...and somehow Lauren just...

790
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:38,480
-Is this crazy?
-No. It's not.

791
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,640
It would explain why he relapsed
so hard this time.

792
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:46,400
I have to show you
something at the center.

793
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:50,360
Back when Charlie and I
first started dating,

794
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:52,680
I noticed him behind the front
desk computer a couple of times.

795
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,520
I didn't think anything about it
at the time,...

796
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:56,080
...but once
I started working here,

797
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:58,040
I figured out
what was really going on.

798
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:01,200
He was using the company account
to order drugs.

799
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:02,480
Painkillers, mostly,...

800
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:05,120
...stuff that conceivably Lauren
would have ordered.

801
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:06,840
But not all the pills
would be accounted for.

802
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:08,520
Oh, Charlie.

803
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:12,360
So it's possible that another
order was placed recently.

804
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:14,120
We can look up the order history.

805
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:17,680
So it does look like
there was an order...

806
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:19,240
...placed for some painkillers.

807
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:20,720
And...

808
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:22,320
Oh, no.

809
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:24,720
No.

810
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:28,880
Wait, but anyone could have
placed this order, right?

811
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:31,120
This doesn't necessarily mean
that it was Charlie.

812
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:33,600
Right, yeah, well, we could
check the security camera

813
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:35,120
and see if he even used
the computer.

814
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:36,200
There's a camera?

815
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:37,480
Yeah. Lauren had it installed...

816
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:39,400
...after the place was
vandalized a few years back.

817
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:42,040
Oh, that's right. Stone mentioned
something about that.

818
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:44,080
-Can we access the footage?
-Yup.

819
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:50,760
Okay, so here's the day
that the order was placed.

820
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:53,640
We can scroll
through the footage.

821
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:01,560
That doesn't look good.

822
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:03,760
Are you gonna tell the detective?

823
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:06,200
I don't know.

824
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:09,640
I mean, the last thing I wanna do
is hurt Charlie,...

825
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:11,800
...but if it's the truth, then...

826
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:14,560
I have no choice.

827
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:17,360
Yeah.

828
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:26,200
I didn't realize just how much
contempt you had for my family.

829
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:32,200
I spoke to Maya.

830
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:34,120
She shared with me your...

831
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:37,440
...concerns about Charlie.

832
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:38,840
Trust me.

833
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:41,680
The last thing I want to do
is hurt Charlie.

834
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:42,720
Trust you?

835
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,800
Amanda, for as long
as I've known you,...

836
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:47,720
...the only thing
I can trust you to do...

837
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:49,560
...is ruin
everything I care about.

838
00:43:50,680 --> 00:43:52,600
Look, I can understand
you blaming me.

839
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:54,320
But Charlie?

840
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:57,480
Never in a million years
did I think...

841
00:43:57,520 --> 00:43:58,840
...you would point the finger
at him.

842
00:44:04,120 --> 00:44:05,360
Say something!

843
00:44:07,080 --> 00:44:07,960
Okay.

844
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:10,920
You don't scare me.

845
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:15,320
I don't wanna blame Charlie,
but I need to know the truth.

846
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:20,280
And you ruined everything
you cared about, not me.

847
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:22,880
You listen to me, Amanda.

848
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:24,880
If you go through with this,

849
00:44:25,240 --> 00:44:27,440
if you tell the detective
what you think,

850
00:44:28,320 --> 00:44:29,640
it'll destroy him.

851
00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:34,400
I already did.

852
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:41,920
Then whatever happens next,
that's on your conscience.

853
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:48,520
<i>I will follow you</i>

854
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:53,280
<i>If you dare to fall</i>

855
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,120

00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:06,160
<i>Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah</i>

857
00:45:06,680 --> 00:45:09,800
<i>Trying to save</i>
<i>The only thing yeah</i>

858
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:12,640
<i>I'm hanging on</i>
<i>I'm hanging by a thread</i>

859
00:45:12,680 --> 00:45:13,720
<i>Breathe in...</i>

860
00:45:14,520 --> 00:45:15,720
<i>...and out.</i>

861
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:18,480
<i>I will follow you</i>

862
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:22,040
<i>Another breath in...</i>

863
00:45:23,240 --> 00:45:26,200
<i>-...and out.</i>
<i>-I will follow you</i>

864
00:45:28,120 --> 00:45:29,560
<i>If you dare</i>

865
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:32,280
<i>Close your eyes and visualize.</i>

866
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:36,120
<i>Find a place</i>
<i>that brings you comfort...</i>

867
00:45:37,560 --> 00:45:40,320
<i>...serenity, joy.</i>

868
00:45:41,120 --> 00:45:42,760
<i>Do you have a clear picture?</i>

869
00:45:44,600 --> 00:45:46,520
<i>Just stay</i>
<i>with whatever is happening.</i>

870
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:48,360
<i>I will follow you</i>

00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:53,000

00:45:53,840 --> 00:45:56,000

00:45:58,120 --> 00:45:59,560
<i>If you dare</i>

00:46:00,440 --> 00:46:01,920
<i>Keep breathing.</i>

875
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:18,400
<i>I will follow you...</i>

876
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:22,280
<i>If you dare to fall</i>

877
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:25,800
<i>I will follow you</i>

878
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:30,240
<i>If you dare</i>
<i>But I can't believe...</i>

879
00:46:31,240 --> 00:46:34,720
<i>I will follow you</i>

880
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:38,600
<i>You...</i>

881
00:46:39,240 --> 00:46:43,200
<i>Let calm rush over you and</i>
<i>let everything just disappear.</i>

882
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:44,840
<i>You...</i>

883
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:46,280
<i>Good.</i>

884
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:56,800
<i>Detective Stone.</i>

885
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:09,240
What happened?

886
00:47:09,880 --> 00:47:12,080
It's Charlie. He's...

887
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:14,200
He had an accident.

888
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:16,920
He...He's alive,
but it isn't good.

889
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:20,600
I know.

890
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:33,480
Oh, gosh.

891
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:36,320
Charlie.

892
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:40,320
Charlie, it's me. It's your dad.

893
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:46,280
What's wrong with him?
Why... Why isn't he responding?

894
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:47,800
He's in a coma.

895
00:47:49,480 --> 00:47:51,480
The fall
and the drugs in his system...

896
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:52,720
...were just too much.

897
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:58,640
The doctors aren't sure
when or if he'll come out of it.

898
00:47:59,320 --> 00:48:02,560
They said he injected a high dose
of something into his arm.

899
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:04,640
Probably morphine.

900
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:06,520
They don't know
if it was an accident or he...

901
00:48:06,560 --> 00:48:08,360
Oh, dammit, Charlie.

902
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:12,880
And, what did the police say...

903
00:48:14,280 --> 00:48:15,160
...about Lauren?

904
00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:17,000
-Do they think that...
-I don't know.

905
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:20,560
Stone just wanted to give us
some time with Charlie, so...

906
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:24,240
I'd like to be with my son.

907
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:26,640
Alone.

908
00:48:27,240 --> 00:48:29,320
No. I'm, I'm not leaving him.

909
00:48:29,360 --> 00:48:31,400
Just go, Amanda.

910
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:34,320
You've done enough.

911
00:48:38,560 --> 00:48:40,640
Okay, well, if you,
if you need us...

912
00:48:40,680 --> 00:48:42,520
Just... Just, just go.

913
00:48:58,040 --> 00:48:59,200
Charlie.

914
00:49:02,760 --> 00:49:03,640
Char...

915
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:14,600
<i>Another breath in...</i>

916
00:49:15,840 --> 00:49:17,040
<i>...and out.</i>

917
00:49:20,680 --> 00:49:23,480
<i>Feel your stress melt away.</i>

918
00:49:25,080 --> 00:49:27,600
<i>Let go of things</i>
<i>beyond your control.</i>

919
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:35,320
<i>Focus on your breath...</i>

920
00:49:36,760 --> 00:49:38,120
<i>...your heartbeat.</i>

921
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:42,440
<i>Stay present in this moment.</i>

922
00:49:56,560 --> 00:49:58,480
I don't understand
what that means.

923
00:49:58,920 --> 00:50:00,600
Those are colchicine tablets.

924
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:02,160
The same thing
they found in Lauren.

925
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:06,080
We found it in Charlie's car,
underneath the seat.

926
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:07,960
Look at the envelope.

927
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:11,520
Yeah, that's the supplier
the center orders from,...

928
00:50:11,560 --> 00:50:13,600
...which is the supplier
Charlie ordered from.

929
00:50:14,920 --> 00:50:16,080
So what?

930
00:50:16,440 --> 00:50:18,280
Charlie's responsible for Lauren?

931
00:50:18,440 --> 00:50:21,160
Possibly,
whether directly or indirectly,

932
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:23,480
there's now a clear connection
between him and Lauren's death.

933
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:28,320
-I mean, if he wakes up...
-When he wakes up.

934
00:50:28,360 --> 00:50:32,320
Sorry. When he wakes up,
I'm gonna have to question him.

935
00:50:33,240 --> 00:50:35,040
He's now a person of interest.

936
00:50:35,800 --> 00:50:37,880
You... you can't possibly think
that Charlie...

937
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:39,880
...is responsible
for his mother's...

938
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:42,960
-Amanda, I...
-No, Charlie is gonna wake up.

939
00:50:43,120 --> 00:50:45,320
And when he does,
he's gonna have an explanation.

940
00:50:45,360 --> 00:50:47,120
And you'll see
that this has all been...

941
00:50:47,160 --> 00:50:48,640
...some kind of misunderstanding.

942
00:50:48,680 --> 00:50:50,520
All right, I'm not trying to jump
to any conclusions.

943
00:50:50,560 --> 00:50:53,240
I just needed to pursue all leads
and possibilities.

944
00:50:56,040 --> 00:50:56,920
Okay.

945
00:50:57,400 --> 00:50:58,280
Okay.

946
00:50:58,760 --> 00:50:59,680
Well, thank you.

947
00:51:00,760 --> 00:51:02,520
Is there anything else
that we can do to help?

948
00:51:03,160 --> 00:51:05,040
Right now you just need
to be there for each other...

949
00:51:05,640 --> 00:51:06,520
...and Charlie...

950
00:51:07,720 --> 00:51:08,600
...and Ian.

951
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:11,840
I know it's gonna be tough, but
Charlie's gonna need some time.

952
00:51:11,960 --> 00:51:15,080
So find a way to cope. You know,
find a way to get some peace.

953
00:51:17,320 --> 00:51:18,200
Thank you.

954
00:51:21,640 --> 00:51:22,600
I know.

955
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:25,680
It sucks.

956
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:32,720
<i>Today we're going to do</i>

<i>beyond your control.</i>

964
00:51:56,400 --> 00:52:00,400
<i>Let calm wash over you and</i>
<i>let everything just disappear.</i>

965
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:03,080
<i>Good.</i>

966
00:52:04,520 --> 00:52:07,920
<i>Focus on your breath,</i>
<i>your heartbeat.</i>

967
00:52:08,680 --> 00:52:11,480
<i>Stay present in this moment.</i>

968
00:52:14,120 --> 00:52:16,640
<i>Let go of the things</i>
<i>beyond your control.</i>

969
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:19,720
<i>Let a wave of calm wash over you.</i>

970
00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:23,440
<i>Let everything else</i>
<i>just disappear.</i>

971
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:51,840
Maya?

972
00:52:53,480 --> 00:52:54,400
You all right?

973
00:52:56,240 --> 00:52:57,120
Yup.

974
00:52:57,680 --> 00:52:59,560
It's just one of those days,
I guess.

975
00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:02,920
Is there something
you wanna talk about?

976
00:53:05,080 --> 00:53:06,800
I saw you with Ian.

977
00:53:08,280 --> 00:53:10,720
Is he doing anything
inappropriate?

978
00:53:10,760 --> 00:53:11,640
No.

979
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:13,360
No.

980
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:15,480
I think we're both
just vulnerable.

981
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:17,480
And I think he got caught up
in the moment.

982
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:18,480
Are you sure?

983
00:53:18,920 --> 00:53:20,680
Because if you need me
to talk to him, I will.

984
00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:22,120
No, please.

985
00:53:22,640 --> 00:53:26,080
He's having a hard-enough time
with everything as it is and...

986
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:29,280
Look, I know you two
don't like each other.

987
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:32,000
But Ian's a good man, okay?

988
00:53:32,040 --> 00:53:33,720
You can't fault him
for just trying to find...

989
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:35,960
...some small amount of comfort
in all of this.

990
00:53:36,120 --> 00:53:37,880
-Okay?
-Okay.

991
00:53:39,120 --> 00:53:42,480
But if you ever need to tell me
anything, know that I'm here.

992
00:53:42,520 --> 00:53:44,240
-Okay?
-I will.

993
00:53:44,920 --> 00:53:45,800
Thank you.

994
00:53:46,240 --> 00:53:48,160
I promise,
there's nothing to worry about.

995
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:50,160
Okay.

996
00:54:07,960 --> 00:54:08,840
I'll get it.

997
00:54:14,280 --> 00:54:16,360
-Oh, hey, Detective Stone.
-Hey.

998
00:54:16,560 --> 00:54:17,520
-Come on in.
-Yeah.

999
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:25,560
-Hey.
-Hey.

1000
00:54:25,600 --> 00:54:27,800
Good evening, everyone,
I'm sorry to disturb your dinner.

1001
00:54:27,840 --> 00:54:29,120
No, it...It's fine.

1002
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:30,480
To what do we owe this pleasure?

1003
00:54:30,520 --> 00:54:31,440
Well I had some good news...

1004
00:54:31,480 --> 00:54:33,960
...and I wanted to come over
and tell you in person.

1005
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:34,920
Charlie's awake.

1006
00:54:35,800 --> 00:54:37,320
So, is he doing okay?

1007
00:54:37,360 --> 00:54:38,840
Well, doctors said he's stable.

1008
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:40,560
He's not speaking yet,
but they're optimistic...

1009
00:54:40,600 --> 00:54:41,840
...he'll be able to talk soon.

1010
00:54:42,120 --> 00:54:44,320
That's wonderful news. Thank gad.

1011
00:54:44,360 --> 00:54:45,240
Can we see him?

1012
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:46,640
He's still a little out of it.

1013
00:54:46,760 --> 00:54:48,840
But I'm told he can see people
tomorrow.

1014
00:54:49,120 --> 00:54:53,240
So what does this mean
as far as the case goes?

1015
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:55,640
We still have to question him.

1016
00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:58,440
And if he's talking tomorrow,
I'll take his statement.

1017
00:54:59,600 --> 00:55:01,000
He's still our best lead.

1018
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,160
Yeah. Well, I'll let you get back
to your dinner.

1019
00:55:04,440 --> 00:55:05,320
Thank you.

1020
00:55:05,800 --> 00:55:07,880
I'll walk you out.

1021
00:56:10,280 --> 00:56:11,960
Code blue! Cell six!

1022
00:56:14,840 --> 00:56:17,120
The good news is we were able
to help him in time,...

1023
00:56:17,160 --> 00:56:19,200
...but it was close.

1024
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:21,000
No, it doesn't make any sense.

1025
00:56:21,040 --> 00:56:22,560
How does something like this
happen?

1026
00:56:22,760 --> 00:56:24,640
The odds that Charlie's
medication was tampered...

1027
00:56:24,680 --> 00:56:27,320
...with so drastically by mistake
are remote.

1028
00:56:27,360 --> 00:56:28,280
So...

1029
00:56:29,600 --> 00:56:31,600
...you're telling me somebody
snuck in...

1030
00:56:31,640 --> 00:56:33,240
...and tried to kill him
while he slept?

1031
00:56:33,440 --> 00:56:34,760
I know it sounds crazy.

1032
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:36,080
-No.
-What...

1033
00:56:36,120 --> 00:56:37,480
It doesn't sound crazy to me.

1034
00:56:39,360 --> 00:56:41,360
Well, we have an officer
stationed outside his room.

1035
00:56:41,400 --> 00:56:43,840
Only authorized personnel
will get in from now on.

1036
00:56:43,960 --> 00:56:45,240
What about family?

1037
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:46,160
I'm sorry.

1038
00:56:46,520 --> 00:56:47,720
I can't let you see him.

1039
00:56:48,320 --> 00:56:50,600
Charlie was targeted in much
the same way his mother was.

1040
00:56:51,080 --> 00:56:52,960
The only obvious conclusion
I can draw from that...

1041
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:56,600
...is that Charlie's attacker is
responsible for Lauren's death.

1042
00:56:57,240 --> 00:56:58,920
This is now
a murder investigation.

1043
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:04,160
Yeah, so...so,
so what happens now?

1044
00:57:04,200 --> 00:57:06,320
You three are
the closest people...

1045
00:57:06,360 --> 00:57:08,960
...in both Charlie
and Lauren's lives.

1046
00:57:09,600 --> 00:57:11,960
So you'll be brought in
for questioning.

1047
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:13,080
What are you saying?

1048
00:57:13,600 --> 00:57:14,800
We're suspects?

1049
00:57:15,800 --> 00:57:16,680
Yes.

1050
00:57:16,920 --> 00:57:18,800
And you're the only ones
we've got.

1051
00:57:20,040 --> 00:57:22,200
But before we do all that,...

1052
00:57:22,960 --> 00:57:24,280
...I'm gonna go check on Charlie.

1053
00:57:25,760 --> 00:57:26,640
Thank you.

1054
00:57:46,280 --> 00:57:47,320
Detective?

1055
00:57:49,080 --> 00:57:49,960
Hey.

1056
00:57:50,160 --> 00:57:51,560
-What happened?
-Charlie, how...

1057
00:57:53,040 --> 00:57:54,000
How are you feeling?

1058
00:57:54,200 --> 00:57:55,760
Only about as good as I look.

1059
00:57:56,600 --> 00:57:57,480
What happened?

1060
00:57:57,520 --> 00:57:59,000
Well, I was hoping
you could help me with that.

1061
00:57:59,640 --> 00:58:00,720
Are you okay to talk?

1062
00:58:02,080 --> 00:58:02,960
Yeah.

1063
00:58:04,040 --> 00:58:05,560
I don't know how much use
I'm gonna be, but...

1064
00:58:05,600 --> 00:58:08,280
Well, you've been unconscious
for almost a week.

1065
00:58:08,520 --> 00:58:09,560
Wait, what?

1066
00:58:09,800 --> 00:58:10,920
Where...where is everybody?

1067
00:58:10,960 --> 00:58:12,560
-Do they know I'm all right?
-Yes, they know.

1068
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:14,880
Maya, Amanda, your father,...

1069
00:58:14,920 --> 00:58:16,280
...they've been here
every single day.

1070
00:58:16,320 --> 00:58:17,520
Hardly left your side.

1071
00:58:18,640 --> 00:58:20,720
The only reason they're not here
now is by my order.

1072
00:58:21,240 --> 00:58:22,120
Why?

1073
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:24,600
Because I gotta ask you
a few questions.

1074
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:25,960
And also...

1075
00:58:27,640 --> 00:58:28,600
While you were under,...

1076
00:58:28,640 --> 00:58:31,960
...someone broke into your room,
pumped your IV full of morphine.

1077
00:58:32,360 --> 00:58:33,400
Enough to kill you.

1078
00:58:33,800 --> 00:58:34,800
Charlie, I need you to think...

1079
00:58:34,840 --> 00:58:36,400
...about that night
of the accident.

1080
00:58:37,320 --> 00:58:38,960
Were you the only one out there?

1081
00:58:40,840 --> 00:58:41,800
I don't know.

1082
00:58:42,800 --> 00:58:45,080
I remember, I, I went to drink.

1083
00:58:46,600 --> 00:58:48,920
Try, please. It's important.

1084
00:58:49,720 --> 00:58:50,760
I remember something...

1085
00:58:52,840 --> 00:58:55,760
Somebody grabbed me, and then,
and then a pain in my arm.

1086
00:58:56,040 --> 00:58:57,800
-Is that from the drugs?
-What?

1087
00:58:57,840 --> 00:58:59,920
Well, doctors said they found
painkillers in your system.

1088
00:58:59,960 --> 00:59:02,120
No, no. I didn't use that night.

1089
00:59:02,720 --> 00:59:04,960
I, I wanted to
and I, I went to, but...

1090
00:59:06,160 --> 00:59:07,360
I couldn't find any.

1091
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:10,480
Are you saying
somebody drugged you?

1092
00:59:12,560 --> 00:59:13,960
I don't remember anything else.

1093
00:59:17,160 --> 00:59:19,000
What about
the colchicine tablets, Charlie?

1094
00:59:19,240 --> 00:59:20,600
We found them in your car.

1095
00:59:21,480 --> 00:59:23,240
What the heck is colchicine?

1096
00:59:47,120 --> 00:59:48,800
I've seen the way
you look at her.

1097
00:59:59,360 --> 01:00:00,520
So you admit it.

1098
01:00:04,280 --> 01:00:05,800
I just wanted to feel...

1099
01:00:07,360 --> 01:00:08,400
...something...

1100
01:00:10,080 --> 01:00:11,320
...besides the grief.

1101
01:00:14,680 --> 01:00:16,000
But it didn't make me feel
any better.

1102
01:00:16,040 --> 01:00:17,240
Just made me feel more...

1103
01:00:18,600 --> 01:00:19,480
...guilt.

1104
01:00:21,920 --> 01:00:24,600
And that's all I feel anymore
is just grief and guilt.

1105
01:00:28,920 --> 01:00:31,600
Do you really expect me
to feel sorry for you?

1106
01:00:32,040 --> 01:00:33,760
She's Charlie's girlfriend.

1107
01:00:33,800 --> 01:00:36,120
-When Charlie finds out, he's...
-I know, okay?

1108
01:00:36,240 --> 01:00:37,120
I know.

1109
01:00:38,080 --> 01:00:40,400
And it kills me to think about
Charlie...

1110
01:00:40,440 --> 01:00:42,080
...laying there in the hospital
and me...

1111
01:00:44,520 --> 01:00:45,760
...I'm tired, Amanda.

1112
01:00:47,120 --> 01:00:48,480
I'm tired of all the fighting.

1113
01:00:49,720 --> 01:00:51,120
I'm tired about the lying.

1114
01:00:54,240 --> 01:00:55,800
I just want it all to be over.

1115
01:01:05,520 --> 01:01:07,360
You want what to be over?

1116
01:01:08,080 --> 01:01:09,240
You were right...

1117
01:01:10,120 --> 01:01:11,760
...about me all those years ago.

1118
01:01:14,240 --> 01:01:15,520
I cheated on Lauren.

1119
01:01:18,600 --> 01:01:21,960
And it was a stupid,
stupid mistake.

1120
01:01:24,080 --> 01:01:25,320
And I couldn't tell her.

1121
01:01:27,760 --> 01:01:30,080
And I regretted it
every day of my life.

1122
01:01:30,240 --> 01:01:31,400
And now she's...

1123
01:01:34,920 --> 01:01:35,840
...she's gone.

1124
01:01:39,440 --> 01:01:42,600
And I was too much of a coward
to tell her...

1125
01:01:45,600 --> 01:01:47,080
...to tell her how sorry I was...

1126
01:01:50,680 --> 01:01:52,240
...how it ate me up inside.

1127
01:01:55,320 --> 01:01:58,640
I really did love her
despite what you think.

1128
01:02:02,360 --> 01:02:03,720
I loved her more than anything.

1129
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:09,120
I never meant to hurt her.

1130
01:02:18,440 --> 01:02:19,520
Where are you going?

1131
01:02:24,560 --> 01:02:25,440
Ian?

1132
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:37,760
<i>-This is Stone.</i>
-Hey, Josh, it's Amanda.

1133
01:02:37,880 --> 01:02:39,240
-Can you talk?
<i>-Yeah.</i>

1134
01:02:39,280 --> 01:02:40,640
<i>I was actually gonna call you.</i>

1135
01:02:40,680 --> 01:02:42,680
<i>I had a talk with Charlie</i>
<i>that was interesting.</i>

1136
01:02:43,280 --> 01:02:45,880
Well, it'll be nothing compared
to what Ian just told me.

1137
01:02:46,320 --> 01:02:48,640
-He admitted to the affair.
<i>-What?</i>

1138
01:02:49,080 --> 01:02:50,440
Oh, you should've seen him...

1139
01:02:50,480 --> 01:02:51,880
...and heard the things
he was saying.

1140
01:02:51,920 --> 01:02:53,080
It was almost like...

1141
01:02:53,560 --> 01:02:55,200
...it was almost like
a confession.

1142
01:02:55,240 --> 01:02:56,520
<i>I'm going to the wellness center.</i>

1143
01:02:56,560 --> 01:02:57,640
<i>Can you meet me there?</i>

1144
01:02:57,960 --> 01:02:58,920
The center?

1145
01:02:58,960 --> 01:03:00,240
-Yeah, but I...
<i>-Good.</i>

1146
01:03:00,280 --> 01:03:01,200
<i>Go now.</i>

1147
01:03:05,080 --> 01:03:06,480
I can't do this anymore.

1148
01:03:08,280 --> 01:03:09,840
I won't be able
to live with myself.

1149
01:03:12,480 --> 01:03:13,680
I understand.

1150
01:03:18,840 --> 01:03:20,440
Did you do what we talked about?

1151
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:23,880
Yeah.

1152
01:03:24,840 --> 01:03:25,800
I...

1153
01:03:26,360 --> 01:03:28,320
I told her about us...

1154
01:03:31,200 --> 01:03:32,600
...and how I cheated on Lauren.

1155
01:03:33,400 --> 01:03:34,360
Everything.

1156
01:03:40,120 --> 01:03:41,560
I'm really proud of you.

1157
01:03:42,920 --> 01:03:44,000
I know that wasn't easy,...

1158
01:03:44,040 --> 01:03:45,920
...but now you don't have to
carry the guilt.

1159
01:03:48,960 --> 01:03:50,680
And like Lauren always said,...

1160
01:03:51,360 --> 01:03:53,120
...Harmony starts from within.

1161
01:03:53,960 --> 01:03:55,000
So...

1162
01:04:10,360 --> 01:04:11,520
-Hey.
-Hey.

1163
01:04:14,080 --> 01:04:14,960
So, what's going on?

1164
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:16,520
I need your help finding
something in Ian's office.

1165
01:04:16,560 --> 01:04:17,920
-What?
-I'll explain as we go.

1166
01:04:17,960 --> 01:04:20,280
I need a warrant to search.
But don't you own the business?

1167
01:04:20,320 --> 01:04:21,920
Oh, half, yeah, technically.

1168
01:04:21,960 --> 01:04:23,720
Do I have your permission
to search the premises?

1169
01:04:28,080 --> 01:04:29,520
So, what are we looking for?

1170
01:04:29,560 --> 01:04:31,720
Charlie said he was attacked
the night of the accident.

1171
01:04:31,760 --> 01:04:33,320
Normally, I'd take that
with a grain of salt,...

1172
01:04:33,360 --> 01:04:35,280
...but since he was also attacked
at the hospital,...

1173
01:04:35,320 --> 01:04:36,760
...it lends the story
some credence.

1174
01:04:36,800 --> 01:04:37,920
Well, how did it happen?

1175
01:04:37,960 --> 01:04:40,080
Well, someone drugged him
and pushed him over the ridge.

1176
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:42,600
And you think his dad did it?

1177
01:04:42,640 --> 01:04:44,400
Well, stranger things
have happened.

1178
01:04:44,440 --> 01:04:46,040
When you told me
about the affair,...

1179
01:04:46,640 --> 01:04:47,640
...thought that sounded like
enough motive...

1180
01:04:47,680 --> 01:04:48,720
...to at least pursue him.

1181
01:04:48,760 --> 01:04:50,280
Now all we need is something
that connects him...

1182
01:04:50,320 --> 01:04:51,320
...to Charlie's accident.

1183
01:04:51,360 --> 01:04:52,320
Is that...

1184
01:05:04,480 --> 01:05:05,840
Looks like we found our weapon.

1185
01:05:10,400 --> 01:05:12,560
-Look.
-Colchicine.

1186
01:05:13,560 --> 01:05:14,520
I'm sorry, Amanda,
looks like you were right...

1187
01:05:14,560 --> 01:05:15,760
...about Ian all along.

1188
01:05:19,200 --> 01:05:20,080
Stone.

1189
01:05:21,280 --> 01:05:22,160
Got it.

1190
01:05:22,720 --> 01:05:23,800
Two shots fired at the house.

1191
01:05:23,840 --> 01:05:24,880
-Let's go.
-What?

1192
01:05:35,400 --> 01:05:37,400
Stay here. Lock the door.

1193
01:06:01,760 --> 01:06:03,000
Is anyone there?

1194
01:06:11,440 --> 01:06:12,320
Hello?

1195
01:06:16,640 --> 01:06:17,800
Is anyone there?

1196
01:06:59,920 --> 01:07:01,200
Maya, what are doing in there?

1197
01:07:01,240 --> 01:07:03,280
-It's Ian.
-It's Ian.

1198
01:07:03,320 --> 01:07:04,560
He...he did this to me.

1199
01:07:04,600 --> 01:07:05,520
We were in the cottage.

1200
01:07:05,560 --> 01:07:07,080
We were talking
and he pulled a gun.

1201
01:07:07,120 --> 01:07:08,800
-He just...
-Okay. Are you okay?

1202
01:07:08,840 --> 01:07:10,200
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

1203
01:07:10,240 --> 01:07:12,120
-Where is Ian now?
-I don't know.

1204
01:07:12,160 --> 01:07:13,280
I, I just took the bat.

1205
01:07:13,320 --> 01:07:14,200
I knocked him out with it...

1206
01:07:14,240 --> 01:07:16,440
-...and then I just ran.
-Okay.

1207
01:07:17,880 --> 01:07:19,280
Was that Amanda?

1208
01:07:21,440 --> 01:07:23,240
-Hey, are you okay?
-Hey. Yeah.

1209
01:07:23,280 --> 01:07:24,560
-He's inside.
-Okay.

1210
01:07:33,680 --> 01:07:34,560
Ian?

1211
01:07:36,680 --> 01:07:37,560
Is he...

1212
01:07:38,520 --> 01:07:39,800
No, he's still alive.

1213
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:41,240
What? Take it easy.

1214
01:07:41,280 --> 01:07:43,200
-Take it easy.
-What...what's going on?

1215
01:07:43,240 --> 01:07:44,800
What's going on is,
you're under arrest.

1216
01:07:44,840 --> 01:07:46,080
-What?
-I have you on assault...

1217
01:07:46,120 --> 01:07:47,120
...with a deadly weapon,...

1218
01:07:47,160 --> 01:07:48,680
...attempted murder
of your son...

1219
01:07:48,720 --> 01:07:49,800
...and a possible murder
of your wife.

1220
01:07:49,840 --> 01:07:51,200
But this is insane.

1221
01:07:51,520 --> 01:07:52,520
Look, I don't know
what happened here,...

1222
01:07:52,560 --> 01:07:54,360
-...but I, I didn't hurt anyone.
-Let's go.

1223
01:07:55,840 --> 01:07:57,360
Maya, tell him.

1224
01:07:57,760 --> 01:07:59,520
I'm sorry, Ian, you need help.

1225
01:08:00,200 --> 01:08:01,080
Amanda?

1226
01:08:02,080 --> 01:08:04,360
-Please, just take him away.
-What? No.

1227
01:08:04,400 --> 01:08:06,200
No, you're,
you're making a mistake here.

1228
01:08:06,920 --> 01:08:09,040
Amanda, Maya.

1229
01:08:11,440 --> 01:08:12,400
It's over.

1230
01:08:18,400 --> 01:08:20,600
Oh, it's so good
to see you sitting upright.

1231
01:08:20,640 --> 01:08:21,640
It feels good, too.

1232
01:08:22,640 --> 01:08:24,680
I never thought I'd be so anxious
to get out of bed.

1233
01:08:24,720 --> 01:08:25,600
Yeah?

1234
01:08:26,360 --> 01:08:29,080
You still think you'll be able
to come home tomorrow?

1235
01:08:29,120 --> 01:08:30,520
That's what the doctor says.

1236
01:08:31,480 --> 01:08:33,120
Although, I'm not sure how much
it's gonna feel like home...

1237
01:08:33,160 --> 01:08:34,360
...after what you told me.

1238
01:08:34,400 --> 01:08:37,280
Charlie, I'm so sorry
for everything he did.

1239
01:08:37,680 --> 01:08:38,920
It's so hard to believe.

1240
01:08:39,680 --> 01:08:40,560
I know.

1241
01:08:40,880 --> 01:08:43,640
I'm still trying to wrap my brain
around it.

1242
01:08:44,160 --> 01:08:46,400
I mean,
why would he do that to her?

1243
01:08:46,520 --> 01:08:48,440
Or just for some insurance money?

1244
01:08:48,840 --> 01:08:51,920
That and the problems he was
having with Mom, apparently.

1245
01:08:52,640 --> 01:08:54,920
I still can't believe he told you
about the affair.

1246
01:08:54,960 --> 01:08:55,880
Me neither.

1247
01:08:56,240 --> 01:08:58,360
It was a long time coming.

1248
01:08:59,440 --> 01:09:00,680
Do you think there were others?

1249
01:09:03,920 --> 01:09:04,800
I don't know.

1250
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,000
It's possible, I guess.

1251
01:09:10,440 --> 01:09:12,000
I never told mom this, but...

1252
01:09:13,480 --> 01:09:15,960
...I always believed you,
about Dad.

1253
01:09:17,240 --> 01:09:19,000
-You did?
-Yeah. I just...

1254
01:09:19,160 --> 01:09:20,200
I couldn't admit it.

1255
01:09:21,480 --> 01:09:22,840
Do you remember
a few years back,...

1256
01:09:22,880 --> 01:09:24,400
...when there was a vandalism
at the center?

1257
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:27,400
-Yeah?
-I don't think it was a robbery.

1258
01:09:27,800 --> 01:09:30,840
I think Dad dumped a girl and
she took it out on the office.

1259
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:34,360
Why are you telling me this?

1260
01:09:34,480 --> 01:09:35,360
Because...

1261
01:09:37,360 --> 01:09:38,760
...I wanted to say I'm sorry.

1262
01:09:40,600 --> 01:09:41,520
That maybe if I did,...

1263
01:09:41,560 --> 01:09:43,120
...things wouldn't have
ended up this way,...

1264
01:09:43,680 --> 01:09:45,440
...that maybe my mom
would've still been here.

1265
01:09:46,360 --> 01:09:47,240
Hey.

1266
01:09:47,680 --> 01:09:49,360
Don't blame yourself for this.

1267
01:09:49,520 --> 01:09:51,480
The only person at fault here
is Ian.

1268
01:09:51,840 --> 01:09:52,720
Okay?

1269
01:09:53,280 --> 01:09:54,160
Yeah.

1270
01:09:55,880 --> 01:09:58,240
All that matters now
is that you're coming home.

1271
01:09:58,960 --> 01:10:00,760
All right, we're gonna
get through this together.

1272
01:10:01,960 --> 01:10:02,840
We're family.

1273
01:10:03,320 --> 01:10:04,400
-Okay?
-All right.

1274
01:10:09,920 --> 01:10:11,280
We really haven't had a chance
to catch up...

1275
01:10:11,320 --> 01:10:12,560
...since the other night.

1276
01:10:13,320 --> 01:10:14,320
Yeah.

1277
01:10:14,880 --> 01:10:15,840
Sorry about that.

1278
01:10:15,880 --> 01:10:16,760
Here you go.

1279
01:10:17,040 --> 01:10:18,480
Yeah, I was fillin' out
a lot of paperwork,...

1280
01:10:18,520 --> 01:10:20,080
...trying to explain
what the heck happened.

1281
01:10:21,280 --> 01:10:22,200
I bet.

1282
01:10:24,240 --> 01:10:25,280
How are you holdin' up?

1283
01:10:26,240 --> 01:10:29,200
A little better.
But still pretty shaken up.

1284
01:10:30,280 --> 01:10:32,600
How about you?
How are things with Ian?

1285
01:10:32,800 --> 01:10:33,920
Just as belligerent.

1286
01:10:34,280 --> 01:10:37,080
Keeps comin' up with every excuse
to deny everything.

1287
01:10:37,280 --> 01:10:39,480
But he can't argue
with the evidence.

1288
01:10:40,160 --> 01:10:42,840
-I know.
-Hey, trust me.

1289
01:10:43,560 --> 01:10:45,240
He's going away for a long time.

1290
01:10:45,640 --> 01:10:47,200
And you can all put this
behind you.

1291
01:10:49,600 --> 01:10:50,920
I hear Charlie's comin' home.

1292
01:10:50,960 --> 01:10:53,320
He is. Yeah.
I just saw him this morning.

1293
01:10:53,360 --> 01:10:55,520
And they cleared him
to leave the hospital tomorrow.

1294
01:10:55,560 --> 01:10:57,120
-Good.
-So it'll be nice...

1295
01:10:57,160 --> 01:10:58,200
...to have him home.

1296
01:10:58,240 --> 01:11:00,320
Nice to make things
feel normal again.

1297
01:11:00,360 --> 01:11:03,440
Well, as normal as possible,
I guess.

1298
01:11:03,800 --> 01:11:04,960
How are things at the center?

1299
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:06,760
Well, we closed it down
for a few days, you know,...

1300
01:11:06,800 --> 01:11:09,240
...while we try and figure out
what to do next.

1301
01:11:09,520 --> 01:11:12,600
Maya keeps saying that I should
take over instead of selling it.

1302
01:11:13,800 --> 01:11:15,280
And keep her on staff,...

1303
01:11:15,320 --> 01:11:18,240
-...I presume. Yeah.
-Yeah, I, I suppose so.

1304
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:19,880
I just...

1305
01:11:20,040 --> 01:11:21,040
I never thought that I'd be...

1306
01:11:21,080 --> 01:11:23,280
...taking over Mom and Dad's
place. You know?

1307
01:11:23,520 --> 01:11:26,040
Well, Lauren's place.

1308
01:11:26,760 --> 01:11:27,880
Your place.

1309
01:11:31,400 --> 01:11:35,000
Well, for what it's worth,
I think you should stay.

1310
01:12:15,800 --> 01:12:17,920
Hello? Anybody there?

1311
01:12:59,640 --> 01:13:00,520
Aunt Amanda.

1312
01:13:00,560 --> 01:13:03,000
Hey, Charlie.
I'm sorry for calling so late.

1313
01:13:03,040 --> 01:13:04,960
-If you can't talk...
-No, no, it's okay,...

1314
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:07,360
...the nurses have eased up on me
since it's my last day.

1315
01:13:07,400 --> 01:13:08,640
-Is everything okay?
-Yeah.

1316
01:13:08,680 --> 01:13:09,960
No, everything's great.

1317
01:13:10,200 --> 01:13:11,560
I just had a quick question.

1318
01:13:11,600 --> 01:13:12,920
Something I'm trying
to figure out.

1319
01:13:12,960 --> 01:13:13,840
Sure.

1320
01:13:13,880 --> 01:13:16,040
The day the colchicine tablets
were ordered,...

1321
01:13:16,080 --> 01:13:17,600
...you were on the computer.

1322
01:13:17,640 --> 01:13:19,760
I saw it on the security camera.

1323
01:13:20,400 --> 01:13:21,280
Okay.

1324
01:13:21,440 --> 01:13:23,240
But if you didn't order
the drugs,...

1325
01:13:23,280 --> 01:13:25,560
...then why were you
on the computer?

1326
01:13:25,600 --> 01:13:27,880
And I'm, I promise,
I'm not accusing you of anything.

1327
01:13:27,920 --> 01:13:30,040
I'm just trying to make sense
of it is all.

1328
01:13:30,080 --> 01:13:31,480
No, no, no, it's,
it's totally fine.

1329
01:13:31,520 --> 01:13:34,360
I, I get it. But ho...honestly,
I can't remember.

1330
01:13:34,920 --> 01:13:36,600
Okay, please try.

1331
01:13:36,640 --> 01:13:38,960
It would have been a few days
before the reopening.

1332
01:13:40,760 --> 01:13:43,560
Remember the night when your mom
asked me to join the business?

1333
01:13:43,600 --> 01:13:45,720
The order was placed
the following day.

1334
01:13:45,760 --> 01:13:47,280
Oh, wait.

1335
01:13:48,280 --> 01:13:50,520
That was the night
Mom started feeling nauseous.

1336
01:13:50,560 --> 01:13:51,680
Maya was looking after her,...

1337
01:13:51,720 --> 01:13:53,920
...so she asked me to check
the schedule on the computer.

1338
01:13:55,360 --> 01:13:58,120
What? Maya asked you
to use the computer?

1339
01:13:58,160 --> 01:13:59,440
<i>Yeah. Why?</i>

1340
01:14:02,360 --> 01:14:03,240
Hello?

1341
01:14:04,480 --> 01:14:05,520
Auntie Amanda?

1342
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:25,880
Oh, good. You're awake.

1343
01:14:47,440 --> 01:14:48,320
Wha...

1344
01:14:48,440 --> 01:14:50,640
Maya, why are you doing this?

1345
01:14:51,600 --> 01:14:53,040
I didn't want this.

1346
01:14:53,280 --> 01:14:54,760
None of this
was supposed to happen.

1347
01:14:54,800 --> 01:14:56,480
Nobody was supposed to get hurt.

1348
01:14:56,520 --> 01:14:58,120
Nobody was supposed to die.

1349
01:14:58,160 --> 01:15:02,600
And then you came here
and ruined everything.

1350
01:15:04,720 --> 01:15:06,600
Just like you did
three years ago.

1351
01:15:07,400 --> 01:15:09,560
It was, it was you.

1352
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:12,160
You're the one that Ian
had the affair with.

1353
01:15:12,200 --> 01:15:16,240
Yes, and everything was fine
and then you told Lauren.

1354
01:15:16,280 --> 01:15:18,080
And then Ian made it stop.

1355
01:15:18,120 --> 01:15:21,000
That's why you killed Lauren?
Because Ian broke it off?

1356
01:15:21,040 --> 01:15:23,160
No, I didn't mean to kill her!

1357
01:15:24,440 --> 01:15:26,840
I just started work here
to spite him.

1358
01:15:27,080 --> 01:15:29,600
He wanted me to leave it,
but then I fell for Charlie.

1359
01:15:29,960 --> 01:15:32,440
Oh, gosh.
Lauren was so nice to me.

1360
01:15:32,960 --> 01:15:34,880
She took me under her wing.

1361
01:15:35,120 --> 01:15:37,840
She trusted me,
she was grooming me,...

1362
01:15:38,400 --> 01:15:40,320
...relying on me.

1363
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:42,360
And then you showed up.

1364
01:15:42,520 --> 01:15:45,240
And she...she just gives you
half the company.

1365
01:15:45,280 --> 01:15:47,200
That's not fair.

1366
01:15:47,240 --> 01:15:50,080
If you cared for Lauren so much,
why did you kill her?

1367
01:15:50,120 --> 01:15:53,480
I didn't mean to kill her.

1368
01:15:53,920 --> 01:15:56,120
I just wanted her to get sick.

1369
01:15:57,360 --> 01:16:00,400
I just wanted to take charge
while she recovered...

1370
01:16:00,440 --> 01:16:05,120
...and show her I deserve
to be here and not you.

1371
01:16:05,640 --> 01:16:07,040
It wasn't just Lauren.

1372
01:16:07,400 --> 01:16:08,680
You hurt Charlie.

1373
01:16:09,440 --> 01:16:11,400
And you framed Ian, too,
didn't you?

1374
01:16:11,680 --> 01:16:13,200
Planted the pills in his office?

1375
01:16:13,240 --> 01:16:15,680
You didn't give me a choice.

1376
01:16:15,720 --> 01:16:17,840
After everything
she did for you...

1377
01:16:18,560 --> 01:16:20,960
Lauren was nothing
but compassionate.

1378
01:16:21,400 --> 01:16:24,040
Tried to help you, but you,...

1379
01:16:24,160 --> 01:16:26,680
...you kill her and
you destroyed everything...

1380
01:16:26,720 --> 01:16:27,840
...she ever cared about.

1381
01:16:27,880 --> 01:16:29,120
Because of you!

1382
01:16:30,240 --> 01:16:31,680
Because of you!

1383
01:16:32,200 --> 01:16:35,840
You kept the detective going
and investigating.

1384
01:16:35,880 --> 01:16:38,360
I wasn't gonna lose
everything,...

1385
01:16:38,400 --> 01:16:39,720
...go to jail
for the rest of my life...

1386
01:16:39,760 --> 01:16:41,600
...because of one stupid mistake.

1387
01:16:41,640 --> 01:16:43,120
Do you understand that?

1388
01:16:43,160 --> 01:16:44,880
-You're a monster.
-No.

1389
01:16:44,920 --> 01:16:47,120
Well, unfortunately for you,...

1390
01:16:47,520 --> 01:16:49,320
...you're the only one
that thinks that.

1391
01:16:51,880 --> 01:16:52,840
No! No!

1392
01:17:03,680 --> 01:17:04,760
No.

1393
01:17:16,320 --> 01:17:19,600
For what it's worth,
I really am sorry.

1394
01:17:19,840 --> 01:17:20,800
Maya, please.

1395
01:17:20,840 --> 01:17:22,320
You don't have to do this.

1396
01:17:22,440 --> 01:17:23,760
Yes, I do.

1397
01:17:23,960 --> 01:17:25,160
But don't worry.

1398
01:17:25,560 --> 01:17:27,440
I'll take care of Charlie...

1399
01:17:28,080 --> 01:17:30,040
...and I'll carry on
Lauren's legacy.

1400
01:17:30,560 --> 01:17:33,320
<i>Close your eyes and visualize.</i>

1401
01:17:53,400 --> 01:17:56,240
<i>Find a place</i>
<i>that brings you comfort.</i>

1402
01:18:01,880 --> 01:18:05,840
<i>Let calm wash over you and</i>
<i>let everything just disappear.</i>

1403
01:18:08,080 --> 01:18:09,480
<i>Good.</i>

1404
01:18:18,600 --> 01:18:19,680
-Hey!
-Hey!

1405
01:18:20,160 --> 01:18:22,280
So, how's the new instructor?

1406
01:18:22,320 --> 01:18:23,400
She's good.

1407
01:18:23,440 --> 01:18:26,880
I mean, she's no Lauren,
but who is?

1408
01:18:27,400 --> 01:18:28,280
Hey, thanks for all your help...

1409
01:18:28,320 --> 01:18:29,720
-...around here, Charlie.
-Yeah.

1410
01:18:29,760 --> 01:18:31,360
I wouldn't be able to
run the place without you.

1411
01:18:31,400 --> 01:18:32,560
I'm really enjoying it.

1412
01:18:32,840 --> 01:18:35,000
And the view
ain't so bad, either.

1413
01:18:35,040 --> 01:18:37,640
You...you just work on
your inner peace, okay?

1414
01:18:46,480 --> 01:18:47,360
Hey.

1415
01:18:48,120 --> 01:18:49,080
Hey.

1416
01:18:49,880 --> 01:18:54,160
I just wanted to say I'm sorry
for how I treated you...

1417
01:18:55,200 --> 01:18:56,360
...and for what I did.

1418
01:18:57,800 --> 01:19:00,440
I'm, I'm sorry, too,...

1419
01:19:01,120 --> 01:19:02,720
...for thinking
you could have done it.

1420
01:19:03,880 --> 01:19:06,520
I, I just wanna move forward.

1421
01:19:06,960 --> 01:19:08,920
I'm still working on
forgiving you...

1422
01:19:08,960 --> 01:19:10,480
...for everything with Maya,...

1423
01:19:10,840 --> 01:19:11,880
...but...

1424
01:19:12,480 --> 01:19:15,400
...I'm, I'm tired of being angry.

1425
01:19:16,240 --> 01:19:17,240
Yeah, me, too.

1426
01:19:18,960 --> 01:19:20,200
I'd like to give it a shot.

1427
01:19:21,800 --> 01:19:22,680
Me, too.

1428
01:19:26,840 --> 01:19:27,840
Hey, buddy.

1429
01:19:36,720 --> 01:19:39,680
So are you gonna tell
Ian and Maya?

1430
01:19:40,480 --> 01:19:41,480
Nah.

1431
01:19:41,760 --> 01:19:43,280
I've done that once before...

1432
01:19:43,320 --> 01:19:46,040
...and all I did was
tear the family apart.

1433
01:19:46,400 --> 01:19:49,120
He never had a chance
to ask Lauren for forgiveness.

1434
01:19:49,160 --> 01:19:51,760
So now's his chance with Charlie.

1435
01:19:53,400 --> 01:19:54,280
So...

1436
01:19:54,800 --> 01:19:56,160
...you decide if you're stayin'?

1437
01:19:56,920 --> 01:19:58,880
It looks that way.

1438
01:19:59,680 --> 01:20:02,600
I'm gonna run the center
with Ian and Charlie.

1439
01:20:02,640 --> 01:20:05,200
And just a fresh new start.

1440
01:20:06,040 --> 01:20:07,760
I think Lauren would be proud.

1441
01:20:08,680 --> 01:20:09,560
Yeah.

1442
01:20:11,080 --> 01:20:12,440
<i>Feel the calm.</i>

1443
01:20:12,800 --> 01:20:14,680
<i>Feel the air around you.</i>

1444
01:20:15,280 --> 01:20:16,760
<i>Let go of your past.</i>

1445
01:20:17,320 --> 01:20:19,120
<i>The future is not here yet.</i>

1446
01:20:19,600 --> 01:20:24,120
<i>Just be in the present</i>
<i>with your breath and your calm.</i>

1447
01:20:30,680 --> 01:20:32,680
<i>Let go of your surroundings.</i>

1448
01:20:32,720 --> 01:20:35,040
<i>Let go of all material things.</i>

1449
01:20:35,560 --> 01:20:39,560
<i>Allow yourself peace and calm.</i>

1450
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:42,760
<i>Let the past retreat.</i>

1451
01:20:44,040 --> 01:20:46,240
<i>Be here in the moment.</i>

1452
01:20:48,800 --> 01:20:50,320
<i>Good.</i>
