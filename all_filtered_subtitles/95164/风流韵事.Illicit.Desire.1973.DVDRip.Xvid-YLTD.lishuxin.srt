The "Orchid Pavilion" Preface reads

7
00:00:30,663 --> 00:00:33,496
Inthe 9thyearofEmperor Yong He

8
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:37,932
Duringthe beginning oflate spring

9
00:00:38,138 --> 00:00:39,469
We had a gathering atthe Orchid Pavilion

10
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:43,907
We, the literati
old andyoung gathered around

11
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:47,944
Amidstthe loftymountains
and exuberantwoods

12
00:00:48,381 --> 00:00:51,441
and bamboos,
the clearwinding stream is flowing by

13
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:54,353
delivering us ourdrinks

14
00:00:54,854 --> 00:00:58,312
There was no music
but everyone drank joyfully

15
00:00:58,491 --> 00:01:02,484
recited poems and
engaged in lively conversations

16
00:01:03,563 --> 00:01:05,394
In 353 A.D.

17
00:01:05,598 --> 00:01:10,058
The 9thyearofEmperor Yung He's regime

18
00:01:10,303 --> 00:01:12,897
Wang Xizhi and a company

19
00:01:13,106 --> 00:01:14,334
offorty one scholars gathered at

20
00:01:14,541 --> 00:01:18,341
the Orchid Pavilion
atKueichi of Chekiang Province

21
00:01:19,145 --> 00:01:21,909
where he wrote aboutthe gathering,
on silk paper

22
00:01:22,315 --> 00:01:25,079
with abrush made out ofmouse whiskers

23
00:01:25,251 --> 00:01:27,378
This unprecedented masterpiece became

24
00:01:27,587 --> 00:01:31,421
the famous Orchid Pavilion Preface

25
00:01:31,658 --> 00:01:34,354
Wangwas dubbedthe sage of calligraphy

26
00:01:35,395 --> 00:01:37,386
Andthis famous masterpiece

27
00:01:37,564 --> 00:01:40,533
with 28 columns and 324 characters

28
00:01:41,167 --> 00:01:44,933
With each characterdiffering in style

29
00:01:45,405 --> 00:01:47,600
Forexample;
the character'chih' is written

30
00:01:47,841 --> 00:01:50,241
intwentythree different styles

31
00:01:51,578 --> 00:01:55,207
Wang's original scriptwas amazing

32
00:01:55,415 --> 00:01:56,848
Afterhe sobered up

33
00:01:57,050 --> 00:01:58,881
He made overone hundred copies

34
00:01:59,085 --> 00:02:02,213
Yetnone quite as excellent
as his firstattempt

35
00:02:02,388 --> 00:02:04,618
He treasured his original copy

36
00:02:04,858 --> 00:02:06,883
and passed downto his descendents

37
00:02:07,894 --> 00:02:12,297
Whenthe scroll reached
the 7th generation

38
00:02:12,499 --> 00:02:14,990
his descendents Zhi Yong and Hui Xin

39
00:02:15,902 --> 00:02:19,269
Theylefthome to become monks

40
00:02:19,472 --> 00:02:23,203
andtheirmonasterywas called
Yong Xin Monastery

41
00:02:25,011 --> 00:02:28,310
Zhi Yong, also a great calligrapher

42
00:02:28,515 --> 00:02:31,678
He wrote 800 copies
ofthe thousandwords essay and

43
00:02:32,185 --> 00:02:34,710
distributedto all monasteries
ofEast Chekiang province

44
00:02:34,921 --> 00:02:37,389
These are now scattered
all overthe world

45
00:02:38,057 --> 00:02:41,151
lttook great effortforZhi Yong
to complete his works,

46
00:02:41,361 --> 00:02:42,828
he used 8 large baskets ofbrushtops!

47
00:02:45,098 --> 00:02:46,588
AfterZhi Yong's death

48
00:02:46,799 --> 00:02:49,859
His pupil, anothermonk Pien Tsai,

49
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:55,039
also alearned scholar,
inheritedthe original copy

50
00:02:55,475 --> 00:02:59,434
Pien Tsaitook up
Zhi Yong's love inthe arts

51
00:03:00,146 --> 00:03:04,515
He guardedthe scroll more carefully
than his late master

52
00:03:05,485 --> 00:03:09,353
Emperor Tang Taizong
was in apractice of...

53
00:03:09,589 --> 00:03:13,355
copyingthe writing style
ofthe Wang calligraphers

54
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:16,586
He triedto acquire allthe works
by Wang Xizhi

55
00:03:17,463 --> 00:03:19,693
To his regret, he couldn'tacquire...

56
00:03:19,899 --> 00:03:22,493
the preface of Orchid Pavilion scroll

57
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:28,298
He heardthatPien Tsai has it

58
00:03:28,508 --> 00:03:31,375
So he invited Pien Tsaito the palace

59
00:03:32,011 --> 00:03:35,572
Pien Tsai deniedthathe hadthe scroll

60
00:03:39,953 --> 00:03:42,581
Thenthe emperorsentFang Xuanling

61
00:03:42,789 --> 00:03:44,814
to visitPien Tsai's monastery

62
00:03:45,358 --> 00:03:47,349
with silk materials forclothes

63
00:03:47,527 --> 00:03:50,792
gold, silver, and manymore treasures

64
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:53,631
Pien Tsai insistedthat
he has searchedthe...

65
00:03:53,833 --> 00:03:56,131
whole monastery
and his late master's library

66
00:03:56,336 --> 00:03:58,600
Yethe had seen no such scroll

67
00:04:00,006 --> 00:04:02,497
Fang Xuanling came up with aplan

68
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:04,869
Xiao Yi's the key person inthis plan

69
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:11,210
Xiao Yi is aman oftalents andtactics

70
00:04:11,384 --> 00:04:15,821
He toldthe emperorthat
Pien Tsai being alearned man

71
00:04:16,055 --> 00:04:19,024
He won't give into a government official

72
00:04:19,225 --> 00:04:20,692
Instead, he should dress up as a commoner

73
00:04:20,893 --> 00:04:23,987
such as abusiness manfrom Shantung

74
00:04:24,197 --> 00:04:28,031
andtake with him afew copies
ofthe works ofthe Wangs

75
00:04:28,401 --> 00:04:30,335
The emperorgave his approval

76
00:04:31,237 --> 00:04:32,966
Xiao Yi sets out on his mission

77
00:04:33,172 --> 00:04:39,133
He reaches the Yong Xin monastery

78
00:04:39,345 --> 00:04:42,837
and hence the popularlegend

79
00:04:43,082 --> 00:04:45,846
The story of
Xiao gettingthe Orchid Pavilion Preface

80
00:04:46,586 --> 00:04:50,852
has been amuch-toldtale
alegend sort of

81
00:06:27,487 --> 00:06:28,545
Who is he?

82
00:06:30,123 --> 00:06:33,115
Haven't seen him before,
don'tthink he's alocal

83
00:06:34,193 --> 00:06:35,717
Looks like a scholar

84
00:06:36,562 --> 00:06:38,223
Invite him infora cup oftea

85
00:06:38,464 --> 00:06:39,328
Yes

86
00:07:03,489 --> 00:07:04,547
Please have a seat

87
00:07:06,392 --> 00:07:09,384
I've heard aboutyourfame

88
00:07:09,562 --> 00:07:11,962
It's myhonorto have metyou

89
00:07:13,466 --> 00:07:15,297
I'm reallyflattered

90
00:07:16,335 --> 00:07:19,930
You have a certain accent

91
00:07:20,139 --> 00:07:21,538
I'mfromthe north

92
00:07:21,774 --> 00:07:24,106
I came from Shantongforbusiness

93
00:07:29,649 --> 00:07:33,779
You don'tlook like abusinessmanthough

94
00:07:34,554 --> 00:07:38,388
I'm actually a scholar

95
00:07:38,591 --> 00:07:41,560
Yetl haven'tachieved much intenyears

96
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:44,957
That's whyl hadto try something else

97
00:07:45,598 --> 00:07:46,622
No wonder

98
00:07:48,901 --> 00:07:49,959
Please

99
00:07:57,176 --> 00:07:59,576
Magic herbs grow onfamous mountains

100
00:08:00,213 --> 00:08:02,943
Jiangnan is a good place to growtea

101
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:08,248
No wonder

102
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:09,920
What?

103
00:08:10,356 --> 00:08:13,052
The wateris the keyin makingtea

104
00:08:13,292 --> 00:08:15,260
Yangzi River's Nanling
has the second bestwater

105
00:08:15,461 --> 00:08:17,190
Wuxi's Huishan Monastery's wateris third

106
00:08:17,396 --> 00:08:19,762
The waterof
Suzhou's Huqiu Monastery's fourth

107
00:08:19,966 --> 00:08:23,265
The fifth is the Bodhisattva Temple
in Danyang province

108
00:08:23,469 --> 00:08:25,767
Daming Temple in Yangzhou is sixth

109
00:08:25,972 --> 00:08:29,203
Wusong riveris seven,
Huaishui is eighth

110
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:35,704
Youforgotthe firstpick

111
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:37,274
Needless to say

112
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:40,442
Waterofthis monasteryis the best

113
00:08:43,422 --> 00:08:45,049
You are too kind

114
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:51,157
The tealeaves, the water
andthenthe fire are all important

115
00:08:51,564 --> 00:08:54,692
Also good companyis essential

116
00:09:01,307 --> 00:09:05,334
True friends are hardto find

117
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:07,175
No doubt

118
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:08,474
That's true

119
00:09:08,681 --> 00:09:11,912
This is special

120
00:09:12,084 --> 00:09:14,780
No needto talk seriously
to an acquaintance

121
00:09:15,254 --> 00:09:17,654
Only confide in atrue friend

122
00:09:17,857 --> 00:09:19,051
Andwhenyou're withthe wrong company

123
00:09:19,258 --> 00:09:21,249
It's betterto keep yourmouth shut

124
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:32,530
lfthe metaphysicalwayis notfollowed

125
00:09:33,472 --> 00:09:36,464
then itbecomes atool

126
00:09:37,877 --> 00:09:42,576
The harp is the
scholars' musical instrument

127
00:09:53,326 --> 00:10:00,129
Ajarofwine freshly opened

128
00:10:00,366 --> 00:10:06,999
Fornewfriends fromfarandwide

129
00:10:07,206 --> 00:10:13,736
Throughthe clouds appears the dusk

130
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:20,749
Thentake a stroll inthe moonlight

131
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:25,857
We getto enjoythe delightful night

132
00:10:26,058 --> 00:10:31,428
And drinkto ourhearts' content

133
00:10:31,597 --> 00:10:37,229
Strangers from remote corners
become instantly close

134
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:43,739
Needn'tfeel apart
though it's ourfirstmeeting

135
00:10:45,077 --> 00:10:45,907
Good

136
00:10:46,412 --> 00:10:49,404
Yan Liben has also painted
the same picture

137
00:10:49,615 --> 00:10:52,175
This painting is extraordinary

138
00:10:52,351 --> 00:10:54,216
The old style with anewtwist

139
00:10:55,454 --> 00:11:01,689
Depictingtheirknowledge throughthe pen

140
00:11:01,927 --> 00:11:08,093
and expressing beautywiththe brush

141
00:11:08,801 --> 00:11:10,530
Wang Xianzhi could
write a characterin one stroke

142
00:11:10,736 --> 00:11:12,601
Lu Tanwei couldfinish apainting in one stroke

143
00:11:12,838 --> 00:11:16,330
That single stroke is extraordinary

144
00:11:16,542 --> 00:11:21,138
fromthe startto the end

145
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:24,544
Wang Xianzhiwas abetterpainterthan...

146
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:27,310
his fatherWang Xizhi

147
00:11:27,486 --> 00:11:28,919
Wang Xianzhi's paintings
outranked his father's

148
00:11:29,155 --> 00:11:31,623
Theywere both bettercalligraphers
than painters

149
00:11:33,225 --> 00:11:37,719
The calligraphy ofthe Wangs
are world renowned

150
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:38,794
Certainly

151
00:11:39,031 --> 00:11:41,499
The strokes ofWang Xizhi's calligraphy
are described

152
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:46,297
as beingforceful like
giants unseating mountains

153
00:11:46,505 --> 00:11:50,464
a dot, like the peak, ahorizontal stroke

154
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:53,838
like athousand mile long
stretch of clouds

155
00:11:54,046 --> 00:11:56,480
Some strokes are like the thunderstorms

156
00:11:56,649 --> 00:11:59,846
The vertical stroke
like the dried up vine

157
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:03,385
to the unprecedentedforce ofhis strokes

158
00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:07,325
Yet so enduringlybeautiful

159
00:12:07,493 --> 00:12:09,927
EmperorLiang compared...

160
00:12:10,162 --> 00:12:12,995
aleaping dragon and a sleepingtiger

161
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:17,269
Unprecedented

162
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:21,067
Indeed

163
00:12:21,273 --> 00:12:24,037
Wang Xianzhi, also known as Zijing

164
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:26,803
took up calligraphy atage 7

165
00:12:27,012 --> 00:12:30,140
Wang Xizhi predicted
Xianzhi's fame correctly

166
00:12:30,349 --> 00:12:34,911
whenthe boyrefused his help

167
00:12:35,121 --> 00:12:39,581
Looks like you knowtheirworks well

168
00:12:39,792 --> 00:12:42,761
Notreally, onlythe general background

169
00:12:42,962 --> 00:12:45,522
Butl have tried
to learntheircalligraphy

170
00:12:45,731 --> 00:12:48,029
I've gotafew oftheirworks with me

171
00:12:48,234 --> 00:12:51,226
The emperorloves the Wangs' calligraphy

172
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:55,271
lthoughthe's boughtalltheirworks

173
00:12:55,508 --> 00:12:57,135
Not entirely

174
00:12:57,343 --> 00:13:02,474
I've got copies of Zhuanghan scroll,
Fengju scroll

175
00:13:02,715 --> 00:13:05,047
and most of all, Orchid Pavilion Preface

176
00:13:05,184 --> 00:13:06,151
Orchid Pavilion Preface?

177
00:13:06,352 --> 00:13:08,820
The one written inthe
9thyearof Yong He?

178
00:13:09,054 --> 00:13:12,490
The one aboutthe gathering
at Shanyin's Orchid Pavilion?

179
00:13:12,925 --> 00:13:13,892
9thyearof Yong He's reign

180
00:13:14,093 --> 00:13:20,396
Wait, are you sayingthat
you've gotthatwithyou?

181
00:13:20,599 --> 00:13:21,827
Of course

182
00:13:34,446 --> 00:13:36,038
It's in myluggage inthe inn

183
00:13:36,248 --> 00:13:37,215
lforgotto bring itwith me

184
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:40,812
ltmightnotbe the genuine scroll

185
00:13:41,053 --> 00:13:42,452
I don'tthink it'd be necessaryto look

186
00:13:43,756 --> 00:13:44,950
MasterPien Tsai

187
00:13:45,157 --> 00:13:47,887
Look atthem andyou'll know

188
00:13:48,093 --> 00:13:50,186
Maybe it's notnecessary

189
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:01,003
This is genuine

190
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:04,700
Of course, and so are the rest

191
00:14:05,211 --> 00:14:06,576
These are all genuine

192
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:11,142
Maybe notforthe Orchid Pavilion Preface

193
00:14:12,151 --> 00:14:15,416
lwouldn't showitto anyone else

194
00:14:15,654 --> 00:14:18,248
Butl must showitto you

195
00:14:18,457 --> 00:14:19,185
I'll getitrightaway

196
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:20,187
Wait

197
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:27,761
Hold on

198
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,232
I've also gota genuine piece to showyou

199
00:14:32,438 --> 00:14:35,965
Calligraphy orpainting?

200
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:42,139
Calligraphy, 9thyearof Yong He

201
00:14:42,348 --> 00:14:47,115
The one ofthe Orchid Pavilion

202
00:14:47,286 --> 00:14:48,253
Orchid Pavilion?

203
00:14:48,454 --> 00:14:49,421
Orchid Pavilion

204
00:14:49,655 --> 00:14:50,519
Orchid Pavilion Preface?

205
00:14:50,756 --> 00:14:52,121
Exactly

206
00:14:52,458 --> 00:14:54,551
The one written inthe
9thyearof Yong He

207
00:14:54,793 --> 00:14:57,421
aboutthe gathering
atthe Orchid Pavilion

208
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:00,721
Exactlythat

209
00:15:07,339 --> 00:15:09,807
Butl've gotthe original piece

210
00:15:10,009 --> 00:15:12,239
So yours mustbe an imitation

211
00:15:13,212 --> 00:15:17,615
It's afake, lfear

212
00:15:19,818 --> 00:15:22,616
Let's take alookfirst, shallwe?

213
00:15:45,744 --> 00:15:47,905
It's an imitation, that's forsure

214
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:49,880
How canyou be so sure?

215
00:15:51,717 --> 00:15:53,912
Look atthe colorofthe ink

216
00:15:55,988 --> 00:15:58,422
Backthen, calligraphers would prepare...

217
00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:00,251
sufficientinkforthe day

218
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:02,791
Theythrew outthe left-over

219
00:16:03,362 --> 00:16:05,956
The inkstone was large and deep

220
00:16:06,165 --> 00:16:09,828
Thick ink was used always

221
00:16:10,035 --> 00:16:12,731
Evenforthe cursive style in calligraphy

222
00:16:12,938 --> 00:16:16,305
Thick ink was used
evenforthe fine strokes

223
00:16:17,443 --> 00:16:21,539
Look atthis color... so you see

224
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:24,044
That's the genuine scroll

225
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:27,046
Why?

226
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:29,818
Wang Xizhiwrote
the Orchid Pavilion preface

227
00:16:30,055 --> 00:16:32,853
outdoors, notathis home

228
00:16:33,058 --> 00:16:36,118
The preface was justa draft

229
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:39,889
The strokes were bold andfree

230
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:45,632
This stroke looks like
along stretch of clouds

231
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:49,035
Andthis one... seems like thunder

232
00:16:49,241 --> 00:16:50,003
Andthis vertical stroke

233
00:16:50,209 --> 00:16:53,610
like the dried vine

234
00:16:57,883 --> 00:17:03,344
So this could be the genuine

235
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:04,784
No doubtaboutit

236
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:07,822
Mylate mastercherished it

237
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:10,052
He passed it onto me before he died

238
00:17:10,262 --> 00:17:12,628
So itmustbe the genuine one

239
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:18,501
Inthat case, I mustmake copies ofit

240
00:17:19,238 --> 00:17:20,728
More than welcome

241
00:17:20,939 --> 00:17:24,067
Let's make three copies everymorning

242
00:17:24,276 --> 00:17:25,709
We can worktogether

243
00:17:25,944 --> 00:17:27,411
Excellent

244
00:18:13,058 --> 00:18:14,491
Please

245
00:18:53,832 --> 00:18:54,662
Master

246
00:18:55,167 --> 00:18:57,761
The vegetarian meal is ready

247
00:18:57,970 --> 00:18:59,562
lfyou could go to perform a ceremony

248
00:19:00,038 --> 00:19:01,528

249
00:19:28,367 --> 00:19:30,597

250
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:32,798

251
00:20:34,099 --> 00:20:34,963
Master

252
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:16,564

253
00:21:17,442 --> 00:21:19,910

256
00:21:33,025 --> 00:21:36,358
The viceroyhas lefttown

257
00:21:37,095 --> 00:21:39,563
What can I do foryou?

258
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:43,859
Please send someone to Yong Xin Monastery

259
00:21:44,069 --> 00:21:45,730
And ask masterPien Tsaito the post

260
00:21:45,937 --> 00:21:47,370
I've gotan important documentforhim

261
00:21:48,974 --> 00:21:50,703
Is itaboutthe Orchid Pavilion Preface?

262
00:21:50,942 --> 00:21:52,466
The Emperorwants to summon him?

263
00:21:52,678 --> 00:21:53,770
No

264
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:57,107
Justtell himthat
a government official asks forhim

265
00:21:57,249 --> 00:21:59,979
Tell him I've known himfora while

267
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:05,449
Agoodfriend? I doubtit

268
00:22:05,991 --> 00:22:07,549
Since I've become
amonk ofthis monastery

269
00:22:07,759 --> 00:22:10,091
I've neversocializedwith anyone
inthe court

270
00:22:10,829 --> 00:22:13,889
Maybe you'll knowwhenyou see him

271
00:22:15,133 --> 00:22:16,395
Is thatpossible?

272
00:22:17,235 --> 00:22:19,760
Please come with me

00:22:20,205 --> 00:22:21,672

Sorryto have troubledyou

276

You're sentfromthe lmperial court?

277
00:22:46,531 --> 00:22:47,589
Yes

278
00:22:47,799 --> 00:22:49,630
I've been orderedto bring back
the original scroll

279
00:22:50,869 --> 00:22:52,268
of Orchid Pavilion Preface,
please forgive me

280
00:22:52,471 --> 00:22:57,101
I've gotitwith me,
nowl mustbidyou goodbye

281
00:22:59,945 --> 00:23:01,139
Inthe12thyearof Zhenguan's reign

282
00:23:01,313 --> 00:23:04,680
Xiao Yitookthe Orchid Pavilion Preface
from Pien Tsai

283
00:23:04,883 --> 00:23:06,043
The emperorwas overjoyed

284
00:23:06,218 --> 00:23:07,651
Yuanlingwas rewardedforhis plan

285
00:23:07,886 --> 00:23:10,582
with 1000 pieces ofbrocades

286
00:23:10,789 --> 00:23:12,814
and apromotion

287
00:23:13,024 --> 00:23:15,049
The Emperorwas furious with Pien Tsai,
but...

288
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:17,421
he decidedto spare him because ofhis old age

289
00:23:17,596 --> 00:23:20,190
The emperoreven sent over
fine gifts andfoods

290
00:23:21,967 --> 00:23:25,664
Pien Tsaiwas terrified;
he couldn't eatanything

291
00:23:25,871 --> 00:23:27,133
except congee

292
00:23:32,744 --> 00:23:35,440
The emperorfell sick
duringthe 23rdyearof Zhenguan

293
00:23:35,614 --> 00:23:39,175
On his deathbed, he toldthe prince:

294
00:23:39,651 --> 00:23:42,677
I have afavorto ask

295
00:23:42,888 --> 00:23:46,881
I've always loved
the Wangs' calligraphy, especially

296
00:23:47,325 --> 00:23:49,486
Orchid Pavilion Preface.
Burythatwith me

297
00:23:51,129 --> 00:23:55,259
Andthat's how the scroll

298
00:23:55,467 --> 00:23:58,095
was buried inthe imperialtomb

299
00:24:06,478 --> 00:24:09,447
The story doesn't end here

300
00:24:10,115 --> 00:24:13,676
The tomb was looted
two years afterthe burial

301
00:24:27,699 --> 00:24:29,690
Indeed amisfortune!

302
00:24:29,901 --> 00:24:31,892
Also quite unfortunate forthe emperor

303
00:24:32,103 --> 00:24:34,628
Here's more to the story

304
00:24:37,676 --> 00:24:39,541
The Orchid Pavilion Preface
was destroyed?

305
00:24:39,778 --> 00:24:43,339
Yes, burntto ashes

306
00:24:52,724 --> 00:24:58,424
No, it's not destroyed

307
00:25:19,050 --> 00:25:21,416
Then, you knew all alongthat...

308
00:25:21,586 --> 00:25:24,020
Xiao Yiwas sentbythe imperial court!

309
00:25:25,790 --> 00:25:30,056
I didn'tknowthat; all I knewwas...

310
00:25:30,262 --> 00:25:34,756
The calligraphy copies he had,
belongedto the court

311
00:25:36,201 --> 00:25:37,327
No wonder!

312
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:39,731
They've gotthe fake scroll

313
00:25:39,938 --> 00:25:41,599
Then why didyoufall sick?

314
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:43,864
Who said I'm sick?

315
00:25:44,376 --> 00:25:45,934
Thenforwhat?

316
00:25:46,478 --> 00:25:49,072
I didn'twantthemto hassle me

317
00:25:57,188 --> 00:25:59,679
Xiao Yi cheated me
forthe Orchid Pavilion

318
00:26:00,191 --> 00:26:01,590
Nonsense

319
00:26:03,361 --> 00:26:06,728
Pien Tsai cheated Xiao Yi
would be more likely

320
00:26:28,286 --> 00:26:31,813
This is Wang Shizhen,
aMing dynasty scholar

321
00:26:32,290 --> 00:26:35,157
He's waitingfor TangJingchuan

322
00:26:36,227 --> 00:26:39,094
It's saidthatWang's father,

323
00:26:39,297 --> 00:26:41,663
Wang Xuwas murdered

324
00:26:41,866 --> 00:26:44,858
forhe refusedto sell
the famous painting...

325
00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:47,095
by Zhang Zheduanto Yan Shifan

326
00:26:47,839 --> 00:26:49,830
Afteran investigation

327
00:26:50,008 --> 00:26:52,476
Wang Shizhen is certainthat

328
00:26:53,778 --> 00:26:56,042
TangJingchuan is the mastermind
ofthe crime

329
00:26:56,815 --> 00:27:00,273
But Tang has no ideathat

00:32:55,306 --> 00:32:57,706
So annoying

403
00:32:58,576 --> 00:33:00,737
She's wearingJinlian's shoes

404
00:33:02,246 --> 00:33:03,804

You're right,
but she's nowmarriedto the master

423
00:33:56,834 --> 00:33:58,893
Ximen Qing likes widows

00:34:09,414 --> 00:34:11,644
His name is Song Ren, a despicable man

431
00:34:11,849 --> 00:34:13,214
He checks outpeople's sizes

432
00:34:13,384 --> 00:34:14,009
Whatfor?

433
00:34:14,218 --> 00:34:15,549

were the famous Qiao sisters

791
01:10:38,667 --> 01:10:41,135
Youwere ugly

792
01:10:41,303 --> 01:10:44,932
We were gorgeous

793
01:10:45,541 --> 01:10:47,099
Look atyourself

794
01:10:47,309 --> 01:10:48,435
No one was interested

795
01:10:48,677 --> 01:10:50,076
No one lovedyou

796
01:10:50,246 --> 01:10:51,713

01:10:52,214 --> 01:10:53,146
Letme tellyou

01:10:53,349 --> 01:10:56,375
It's all because of
the matchmakeryou sent

01:10:56,585 --> 01:10:58,348
She's good

800
01:10:58,554 --> 01:11:00,522
She tricked me by saying
allthe rightthings

801
01:11:00,756 --> 01:11:03,054
She tricked me...

802
01:11:03,259 --> 01:11:05,989
into marryingyou.

803
01:11:06,428 --> 01:11:11,058
You're so ungrateful

804
01:11:11,267 --> 01:11:12,734
You don't deserve me

805
01:11:12,935 --> 01:11:13,902
Neitherdo you

806
01:11:14,103 --> 01:11:16,071
You have also arotten heart

807
01:11:16,672 --> 01:11:19,197
You're atigress...

808
01:11:20,442 --> 01:11:22,535
You're atiger...

809
01:11:23,245 --> 01:11:24,234
What's withyoutwo?

Come on, prosperity comes with peace

811
01:11:27,383 --> 01:11:28,816
Prosperity? We lost ourcows

812
01:11:29,051 --> 01:11:30,177
Come on, let's look

813
01:11:30,352 --> 01:11:32,820
I've looked everywhere

814
01:11:33,055 --> 01:11:34,181
I've gotan idea

815
01:11:34,356 --> 01:11:35,983
Go to the Little Fairy and ask

816
01:11:36,225 --> 01:11:37,487
We're sure to geta good advice

817
01:11:37,693 --> 01:11:39,183
Really?

818
01:11:39,395 --> 01:11:42,421
He's good,
when my daughter-in-lawwas pregnant

819
01:11:42,598 --> 01:11:44,623
He said she's goingto have a son

820
01:11:44,867 --> 01:11:47,665
And she did

821
01:11:48,137 --> 01:11:51,868
Right, Little Fairyitis then;
where's he?

822
01:11:52,074 --> 01:11:53,905
EastMain Street

823
01:11:54,109 --> 01:11:55,838
Rightinfront of
the Tiandetang Herb Store

824
01:11:56,045 --> 01:11:56,875
Right

825
01:11:57,046 --> 01:11:58,377
Tian de-tang

826
01:12:02,584 --> 01:12:04,108
The Little Fairy, overthere

827
01:12:18,467 --> 01:12:20,162
Is this the herbal store?

828
01:12:20,369 --> 01:12:22,633
Yes, youwant some medication?

829
01:12:30,946 --> 01:12:31,970
Atthe back...

830
01:12:36,085 --> 01:12:39,577
Since this guy gothere...

831
01:12:39,788 --> 01:12:41,415
Ourbusiness is in shambles

832
01:12:41,590 --> 01:12:42,648
Gettingworse everyday

833
01:12:42,891 --> 01:12:43,823
So unlucky

834
01:12:44,026 --> 01:12:47,359
We should get some bullies
to kick him out

835
01:12:47,529 --> 01:12:51,158
His godfatheris the police chief

836
01:12:52,034 --> 01:12:53,797
Maybe we'lltry something else

837
01:12:54,002 --> 01:12:54,764
What?

838
01:12:54,970 --> 01:12:56,335
He's calledthe Little Fairy, right?

839
01:12:56,538 --> 01:12:58,096
So supposedlyhe's the prophet

840
01:12:58,307 --> 01:13:01,708
Ask him howmuch we'll make today

841
01:13:02,244 --> 01:13:04,212
lfhe's bluffing and said 2 dollars

842
01:13:04,380 --> 01:13:07,178
Then we'll have a sale

843
01:13:07,383 --> 01:13:08,611
We'll saywe only earned 1 dollar

844
01:13:08,851 --> 01:13:11,342
Then we can kick him out
forincorrectpredictions

845
01:13:14,323 --> 01:13:15,017
Good idea

846
01:13:15,257 --> 01:13:15,916
Let's go

847
01:13:22,331 --> 01:13:23,298
Pick one

848
01:13:37,079 --> 01:13:38,944
What do youwantto know?

849
01:13:40,883 --> 01:13:42,646
Catch something

850
01:13:42,851 --> 01:13:45,718
Catch what?

851
01:13:47,055 --> 01:13:48,545
Something?

852
01:13:49,792 --> 01:13:51,657
Something?

853
01:13:52,961 --> 01:13:56,021
Well, not exactly qualifies as aman

854
01:14:01,770 --> 01:14:08,573
An adulterer?

855
01:14:10,579 --> 01:14:11,409
How do you know?

856
01:14:12,247 --> 01:14:14,875
The characteryou picked has 3 parts

857
01:14:15,117 --> 01:14:19,076
2 husbands, then a sun

858
01:14:19,254 --> 01:14:22,951
Awoman can onlyhave one husband

859
01:14:23,192 --> 01:14:26,650
She has one husband

860
01:14:26,862 --> 01:14:30,298
The otherone is the adulterer

861
01:14:34,369 --> 01:14:35,427
Can I catch him?

862
01:14:36,772 --> 01:14:40,606
Lthinkthe possibilityis slim

863
01:14:40,809 --> 01:14:42,174
It's more likely you'll lose...

864
01:14:43,011 --> 01:14:45,411
than win inthis matter

865
01:14:45,581 --> 01:14:50,041
Accordingto the characteryou picked

866
01:14:50,252 --> 01:14:52,413
lthinkthe chances aren't good

867
01:14:53,889 --> 01:14:55,857
Youwon't getanythingfrom it

868
01:14:56,058 --> 01:14:59,323
Trustme

869
01:14:59,795 --> 01:15:05,290
Youwon'twin

870
01:15:06,368 --> 01:15:07,460
Damn

871
01:15:08,804 --> 01:15:10,829
Oh, nowit's gotworse

872
01:15:11,306 --> 01:15:12,864
Withthat stamping

873
01:15:13,075 --> 01:15:16,772
You're goingto fall down

874
01:15:16,979 --> 01:15:19,345
I doubtthat
youwould catchthe adulterer

875
01:15:19,515 --> 01:15:21,642
Andyou're goingto trip over

876
01:15:47,543 --> 01:15:49,135
Picking a characterortelling afortune?

877
01:15:49,611 --> 01:15:50,475
Would like fortune foretold

878
01:15:51,313 --> 01:15:52,177
Ohthe boss ofthe herbal store!

879
01:15:53,048 --> 01:15:54,140
Excuse me

880
01:15:55,584 --> 01:15:56,573

881
01:15:56,818 --> 01:16:00,379
We're neighbors,

882
01:16:00,989 --> 01:16:03,787
Pick one

883

What do youwantto know?

884
01:16:17,506 --> 01:16:21,135
Howmuch business I'll do today?

885
01:16:21,343 --> 01:16:25,803

lwon'tbe called The Little Fairy
ifl'm wrong

893
01:17:03,218 --> 01:17:07,450
lthink you'll make 2 dollars today

894
01:17:07,689 --> 01:17:10,817
Not one centmore orless

895
