20
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:53,060
Last night, I dreamt I went to Manderley again.

21
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:55,740
I dreamt that where our drive once lay,

22
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:58,110
a dark and tortured jungle grew.

23
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:04,490
Nature had come into her own and yet the house still stood.

24
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:06,280
Manderley.

25
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:09,400
Secretive and silent as it had always been.

26
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:11,740
Risen from the dead.

27
00:01:16,150 --> 00:01:19,280
Like all dreamers, I was allowed to pass through my memory.

28
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:22,030
Spanning the years like a bridge.

29
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:26,150
Back to that summer in Monte Carlo

30
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,610
when I knew nothing and had no prospects.

31
00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:45,280
Did you say eight?

32
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,490
Huit. Yes.

33
00:01:49,570 --> 00:01:50,040
Merci. 

34
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:51,650
- Au revoir. - Au revoir.

35
00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:00,320
I can see the girl I was so clearly,

36
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:02,780
even if I no longer recognize her.

37
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:07,320
And I wonder 

38
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:10,110
what my life would have been without Mrs. Van Hopper.

39
00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:13,110
Without that job.

40
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:16,030
Funny to think that the course of my existence

41
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:18,400
hung like a thread upon her curiosity.

42
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:22,860
If it wasn't for her, I would never have gone to Manderley...

43
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:25,450
and would never have met you.

44
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:27,700
Mrs. Van Hopper.

45
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:29,900
What kept you?

46
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:33,780
I'm sorry. I had to wait for a package at the post office. I...

47
00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:35,740
I believe it's from your nephew.

48
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:39,940
Oh, photographs of his honeymoon with that ghastly girl, I imagine.

49
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:40,780
Open it.

50
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:43,350
Get a table downstairs for lunch. 

51
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:44,820
Yes. One o'clock as usual?

52
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:48,320
- Now. I've just seen Maxim de Winter. - Oh, right.

53
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:49,990
Still heartbroken, by the look of it.

54
00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:51,530
He's a friend of yours?

55
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:55,200
Maxim de Winter, owner of Manderley.

56
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:58,240
- One of the finest homes in England. - Oh, yes.

57
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:01,450
His wife died last year. He's in dire need of company.

58
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:04,190
Have the maître d' seat him next to me.

59
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:11,240
You'll have to tip.

60
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:16,900
Honestly, with everything I'm teaching you,

61
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:18,280
you ought to be paying me.

62
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:20,990
- Thank you, Mrs. Van Hopper. - Stupid girl.

63
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:30,450
- Bonjour. - Mademoiselle.

64
00:03:31,490 --> 00:03:33,150
Madam Van Hopper's usual table?

65
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:34,570
Oh, yes, thank you. Merci.

66
00:03:34,570 --> 00:03:35,900
Oh, no. 

67
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:37,950
Wait, sorry. She was wondering

68
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:40,110
if a Mr. de Winter could sit with her.

69
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:42,240
- Monsieur Maxim de Winter? - Oui.

70
00:03:42,610 --> 00:03:45,700
It is the choice of Mr. de Winter where he wishes to be seated.

71
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:47,110
Oh, yes, of course.

72
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:48,700
Merci.

73
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:53,490
So sorry. Is that not enough? Um, here. I've got more.

74
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:56,990
God, I'm so sorry, monsieur.

75
00:03:58,740 --> 00:03:59,490
Just one moment.

76
00:03:59,490 --> 00:04:02,070
Don't do it. I've heard he's a terrible bore.

77
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:05,320
- Excuse me? - This de Winter chap.

78
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:06,150
Thank you.

79
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:10,610
Monsieur de Winter, please, this way.

80
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:26,490
Des huîtres, une douzaine.

81
00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:28,150
"Des huîtres, une douzaine."

82
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:29,940
Maxim de Winter.

83
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:34,110
Well, I never. I had no idea you were in Monte.

84
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:35,990
You must join us.

85
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:40,200
Edie Van Hopper. I think you remember my nephew. Billy?

86
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:42,930
You met him at Blenheim last fall. Billy Whitney. 

87
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:44,280
He's about my height.

88
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:47,280
He's got sandy hair and he's got a bit of a lazy eye.

89
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,240
I can't imagine how I could've forgotten.

90
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,320
Do give my regards to Billy.

91
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,650
Oh, would you know?

92
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:55,240
He's married, and to the most enchanting girl.

93
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:56,500
- Is he? Good. - He sent photographs.

94
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:57,380
I'm going to show them to you.

95
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:59,540
- Come here. The wedding was divine. - I believe you,

96
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:01,200
but I prefer to lunch alone.

97
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:04,070
Good day, Miss Van Hopper.

98
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:05,070
- Oh, no. - What? 

99
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:08,640
We're not related. She's staff.

100
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:14,280
Well, I mean, I guess you could call her my ward.

101
00:05:15,170 --> 00:05:17,650
I see. Now, if you'll excuse me.

102
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:19,110
Darling, why don't fetch those photographs?

103
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:21,150
- I'm sure Mr. de Winter would love to see them. - Yes.

104
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:23,030
No, please, please, please. Don't trouble yourself.

105
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:25,190
- It's unnecessary. - Oh, my precious, it's no trouble at all!

106
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,660
Not at all. Go along. Quickly. 

107
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,320
No, no. She'll be down in a jiffy.

108
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:44,490
No, this is my favorite part.

109
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:46,740
I asked her to go and get the photographs,

110
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:48,610
and she darts from the table,

111
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:50,490
and then she's gone. Doesn't come back.

112
00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:53,780
I thought, "Oh, God, don't tell me she started sketching."

113
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:56,610
- Oh, no, no, she's an artist. - Oh, my!

114
00:05:56,610 --> 00:05:59,110
Anyway, she comes running back down,

115
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:01,780
reeking of cheap rose water.

116
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:06,740
I mean, the smell of it!

117
00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:10,490
Show me an eligible bachelor

118
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:12,130
and I will show you a room 

119
00:06:12,130 --> 00:06:16,150
full of women acting like they've lost their minds.

120
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,130
It's too late.

121
00:06:19,530 --> 00:06:21,150
- Sorry. - Never mind, sit down.

122
00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:24,240
Related. I mean, imagine.

123
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:28,320
I loved the Manderley ball. It was just so glamorous.

124
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:30,650
I suppose that's all stopped since the tragedy.

125
00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:33,240
Such a shocking thing that happened.

126
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,820
- How do you explain it? - Awful.

127
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:36,990
He adored her!

128
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,240
His Rebecca.

129
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:46,360
Morning, Mrs. Van Hopper.

130
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,470
Mrs. Van Hopper?

131
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:54,780
Are you all right?

132
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:57,400
I'm sick. I'm sick.

133
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:02,030
I'm... I was sick all night.

134
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:05,530
- Call the... call the medecin. - Okay.

135
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:09,280
- Call them right now. The doctor. - All right.

136
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:12,780
Where is the bucket? Where's the bucket?

137
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:15,610
I'll get the bucket! Here, I've got it.

138
00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:20,690
You are waiting for madame?

139
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:23,740
Oh, no. She's unwell. The doctor told her to rest.

140
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:25,110
So, it's just me today.

141
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:28,570
It is not possible. The terrace is for guests only.

142
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:31,350
But I'm a lady's companion...

143
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:33,280
Really?

144
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,070
Yes, it is not for staff.

145
00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:41,360
Monsieur? The young lady will be joining me. 

146
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:42,740
Set another place, please.

147
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:44,030
Bien sûr, Monsieur de Winter.

148
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:45,990
No, please. I couldn't possibly.

149
00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:47,360
It's absolutely fine.

150
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,700
And we needn't talk unless we feel like it. 

151
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:54,150
You... you didn't have to do that.

152
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:56,380
My motives were entirely selfish.

153
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:59,150
This is yesterday's paper. I've already read it.

154
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,740
Thank you. It's very kind.

155
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:07,780
So, what is it you do for...

156
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:09,860
I'm what's called "a lady's companion."

157
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:11,320
If a lady has to pay for company,

158
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:13,280
that says something about the lady, doesn't it?

159
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:16,360
May I take your order?

160
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,950
Des huîtres, une douzaine.

161
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:20,950
For breakfast?

162
00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:23,320
You heard her. Et encore du café.

163
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:26,110
Bien, Monsieur de Winter. Mademoiselle.

164
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:31,610
If it's not rude, why her?

165
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:32,730
Seems like you would 

166
00:08:32,730 --> 00:08:35,150
make an excellent companion for any number of people.

167
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:36,260
But I've always wanted to travel, 

168
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:38,860
so there's that, and £90 a year.

169
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:42,230
I know that doesn't seem very much to you, 

170
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:44,360
but it's a lot to me.

171
00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:47,240
I suppose you can set a price on loneliness.

172
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,940
It's odd, isn't it? Some people seem perfectly happy alone

173
00:08:49,950 --> 00:08:52,450
while others just need someone to pass the time with. 

174
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:54,240
Doesn't matter who.

175
00:08:55,070 --> 00:08:55,860
Which are you?

176
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:58,570
Well, my parents are dead, so... 

177
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,780
I'm used to being alone.

178
00:09:04,070 --> 00:09:05,360
Here comes your breakfast.

179
00:09:07,450 --> 00:09:09,780
Et voilà. Une douzaine d'huîtres.

180
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:13,530
I've always wanted to try them, so...

181
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,740
Try them before they get warm.

182
00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:35,530
Thank you so much. I don't think I've ever spoken so much in my entire life.

183
00:09:35,530 --> 00:09:36,740
It was very impressive.

184
00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:40,780
- And I'm sorry about the oysters, too. I... - No, that was fine.

185
00:09:41,150 --> 00:09:42,690
Thank you very much. I...

186
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:45,280
I haven't enjoyed myself like that for quite a long time.

187
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:50,700
À bientôt.

188
00:10:11,650 --> 00:10:12,610
Hello?

189
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:19,860
- A note from the front desk. - Merci. Madame's indisposed.

190
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:22,030
- I'll take it to her. - It's for you, mademoiselle.

191
00:10:24,030 --> 00:10:24,740
Merci.

192
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:29,650
What do they want?

195
00:10:32,950 --> 00:10:35,030
It was just the front desk, they were...

196
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:38,150
wondering how you are.

197
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:58,530
So how did you escape?

198
00:10:58,570 --> 00:10:59,820
I said I had a tennis lesson.

199
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:01,400
She's been on at me to improve my game.

200
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:02,450
Sneaky.

201
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:07,240
- So where do you want to go? - Anywhere is fine.

202
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:09,610
There must be somewhere you want to see.

203
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:11,490
Well, it's quite far.

204
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:14,360
Good. I could use the fresh air.

205
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:16,990
Is this a 3.5-liter Bentley?

206
00:11:16,990 --> 00:11:19,240
It is. How do you know so much about cars?

207
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:22,490
Oh, my father, he loved them.

208
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:25,740
If I may ask, when did your parents pass away?

209
00:11:27,070 --> 00:11:28,900
Two winters ago. Influenza.

210
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:31,110
Well, my mother died of influenza, and my...

211
00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:34,110
father died just four days later.

212
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:38,490
Do you think a person could die of a broken heart?

213
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:46,150
- That was thoughtless of me. I'm sorry. - No.

214
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:54,300
It's all right.

215
00:11:55,450 --> 00:11:56,780
All part of the plan.

217
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:09,820
There's actually a cactus, it's native to Mexico,

218
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:12,990
and it grows to 65 feet tall.

219
00:12:12,990 --> 00:12:17,030
It lives for 200 years, but it doesn't flower until it's 70.

220
00:12:17,950 --> 00:12:19,280
Where do you learn this stuff?

221
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:21,940
I read about it somewhere. Everything I know is from books.

222
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:25,740
I haven't really experienced anything yet.

223
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,820
I plan to before I'm old.

224
00:12:35,870 --> 00:12:36,470
Look!

225
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:53,150
Have you been here before?

226
00:12:55,450 --> 00:12:58,900
Years ago. On my honeymoon.

227
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:11,900
- How did your wife... - Please... let's not.

228
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,320
Mr. de Winter.

229
00:13:48,110 --> 00:13:49,570
- Go on. - Oh, no. I couldn't.

230
00:13:49,570 --> 00:13:52,700
Yes. Yes, you can. You know how, don't you?

231
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,110
Well, yes, I...

232
00:13:55,110 --> 00:13:57,950
Well, good. As long as you didn't learn from a book.

233
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:06,900
Will you tell me about Manderley? I hear it's beautiful.

234
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:08,740
It is. Yeah.

235
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:11,990
Manderley, it's more than a house. It's my life.

236
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:15,740
It's been passed from father to son and father to son for centuries.

237
00:14:16,650 --> 00:14:17,990
Until now, anyway.

238
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:23,070
You see, if I die without an heir, it goes to my sister.

239
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:27,240
And her sons are nice boys, but they're just not de Winters.

240
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:40,490
There we go.

241
00:14:40,490 --> 00:14:42,740
Well, thank you for getting us home safely.

242
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:44,530
Don't forget your things.

243
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,360
Sir, would you give us a hand?

246
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:50,740
This is what I need from you.

247
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:53,860
Would you grab that bag and just lift at the same time?

248
00:14:55,030 --> 00:14:56,570
One, two, three.

250
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:01,900
Put that back, please.

251
00:15:02,450 --> 00:15:03,900
Yes, of course. I'm sorry. I...

252
00:15:04,450 --> 00:15:06,740
Leave the keys with the valet. Good night.

253
00:15:07,450 --> 00:15:08,110
Good night.

254
00:15:20,070 --> 00:15:21,030
Hello.

255
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,610
The nurse left an hour ago.

256
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:31,570
The tennis coach only had a late session free...

257
00:15:32,610 --> 00:15:34,450
and I was practicing my serve.

258
00:15:37,030 --> 00:15:39,320
A tennis lesson in the dark?

259
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,110
Yes.

260
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:52,610
Rebecca from Max. Max from Rebecca.

261
00:15:52,610 --> 00:15:57,530
You stupid girl. Why would I look at his personal book?

262
00:16:18,450 --> 00:16:20,740
For you. From Monsieur de Winter.

264
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:38,860
Pour moi? Merci.

265
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:47,200
- I'm off. - What have you got on?

266
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:48,900
I can see right through it.

267
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:52,950
- You wearing any undergarments? - Yes, of course.

270
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:03,070
I'm trying to paint those beautiful houses.

271
00:17:03,070 --> 00:17:07,740
Actually, you don't need your tennis racket. All right.

272
00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:09,570
Mademoiselle.

273
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:12,530
Merci.

274
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:27,990
- What are you doing? - Oh, you'll see.

275
00:17:35,450 --> 00:17:40,030
Imagine if you could bottle a memory like scent.

276
00:17:42,570 --> 00:17:44,650
Then, whenever you wanted, you could open it.

277
00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:48,490
It'd be like living the moment all over again.

278
00:17:50,950 --> 00:17:52,420
And what particular moments

279
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:54,820
in your young life would you bottle?

280
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:58,200
This week. Now. Every minute of it.

281
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:01,860
Never forget it.

282
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:07,860
And any memories you didn't want, you could simply throw away.

283
00:18:12,570 --> 00:18:13,780
"Come for a drive."

284
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:15,200
"Lunch at the Cap."

285
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,610
The beach.

286
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:34,400
But I love the coast down here.

287
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:37,070
It's so beautiful.

288
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:40,110
Oh, there we go!

289
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:41,280
What are you looking at?

290
00:18:41,610 --> 00:18:45,150
- Um, well, it's... - Let me see.

291
00:18:45,490 --> 00:18:46,740
No, I wouldn't if I were you.

292
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:49,360
No... Well, it's just as well you're not...

293
00:18:56,610 --> 00:18:58,150
- Sorry. - That's all right.

294
00:18:59,110 --> 00:19:01,400
Come on. Let's go for a swim.

295
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:05,030
Come on. Come on!

296
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:08,320
- Come in! - No!

297
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:10,610
- Why not? - I don't want to!

298
00:19:10,610 --> 00:19:12,280
What are you afraid of?

299
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:15,740
It's too cold. No, it's freezing.

300
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:17,400
No, it's not. It's lovely!

301
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:20,280
I can feel it. It's freezing cold!

302
00:19:20,990 --> 00:19:23,860
- You come here! - No. I'm gonna drink all the champagne.

303
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:25,070
I don't care!

304
00:19:25,570 --> 00:19:27,360
God! Look at what you're making me do.

305
00:20:56,610 --> 00:20:57,490
Oh, you're up.

306
00:20:58,780 --> 00:20:59,990
I, um...

307
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:04,450
I'm so glad you're feeling better. Where's the nurse?

308
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:06,360
Dismissed.

309
00:21:08,530 --> 00:21:11,490
Took a swim, I see. After tennis?

310
00:21:12,610 --> 00:21:13,360
Yes.

311
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:17,950
Well, go on. Dry your hair. Chop-chop.

312
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:20,150
Are we going down for dinner?

313
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:22,360
I am.

314
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:24,150
You can see the concierge about

315
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:26,110
booking us on the early train tomorrow.

316
00:21:26,450 --> 00:21:27,990
And you can set about packing.

317
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,200
Um, tomorrow?

318
00:21:30,650 --> 00:21:32,490
Billy is sailing for New York on Saturday.

319
00:21:32,490 --> 00:21:34,070
We can catch the same boat.

320
00:21:34,490 --> 00:21:36,990
I'm sick to death of Europe.

321
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,530
Don't look at me like a drowned rat.

322
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:46,610
You'll get used to New York fast enough.

323
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:50,200
Plenty of boys and excitement.

324
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:52,650
All in your own class.

325
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:05,570
Did you really think people wouldn't talk?

326
00:22:07,110 --> 00:22:08,480
Oh, you're best out of it.

327
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:11,440
Everyone knows he nearly lost his mind after she died.

328
00:22:11,450 --> 00:22:13,990
It was all too sudden and tragic.

329
00:22:15,530 --> 00:22:18,320
Do you honestly think he is in love with you?

330
00:22:20,030 --> 00:22:22,240
It was a distraction, dear. That's it.

331
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:26,320
We'll go away. We'll go to New York.

332
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:28,400
You'll find your way.

333
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:31,200
You'll forget all about it.

334
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:35,400
Trust me, you will forget all about it.

335
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,030
Just a moment.

336
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,820
Mrs. Van Hopper is leaving and I have to go, too.

337
00:22:52,990 --> 00:22:55,030
- What are you talking about? -Yes. Now. Today.

338
00:22:55,030 --> 00:22:57,450
I just wanted to say goodbye.

339
00:22:57,860 --> 00:22:59,240
Why haven't you told me before?

340
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:01,150
Because she only decided it last night.

341
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:05,190
And we're going to Paris with... to meet her nephew.

342
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:07,280
Then we go to Cherbourg to sail to New York.

343
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:09,070
All right. Listen, you mustn't cry.

344
00:23:09,070 --> 00:23:11,360
Just give me a moment to think.

345
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,200
I...

346
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:16,860
I can't stay long. She's expecting me downstairs.

347
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:21,650
Come with me.

348
00:23:23,030 --> 00:23:23,650
What?

349
00:23:24,450 --> 00:23:25,360
To Manderley.

350
00:23:27,950 --> 00:23:31,150
What? As your secretary?

351
00:23:31,150 --> 00:23:33,110
No. No.

352
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:35,650
As my wife.

353
00:23:37,950 --> 00:23:40,320
I'm asking you to marry me, you little fool.

354
00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:43,650
I can't come to Manderley.

355
00:23:43,650 --> 00:23:46,530
Yes, you can. You said you wanted to see the world.

356
00:23:46,990 --> 00:23:48,990
Manderley is the best part of it.

357
00:23:50,070 --> 00:23:52,820
Well, of course she's down there. Where else is she?

358
00:23:53,070 --> 00:23:56,110
Yes, I've got to leave in 20 minutes to catch the train.

359
00:23:56,740 --> 00:23:58,030
- I'll tell her. - Do we have to go?

360
00:23:58,030 --> 00:24:00,610
No, in fact... Yes, we do. I'm actually looking forward to this.

361
00:24:00,610 --> 00:24:02,360
That's exactly what I'm waiting for.

362
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:04,360
Now, don't worry.

363
00:24:07,070 --> 00:24:08,150
Who is this now?

364
00:24:19,650 --> 00:24:22,400
This is the most wonderful news I've ever heard in my life!

365
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,150
Wait till I tell my friends, I can't believe it!

366
00:24:24,150 --> 00:24:26,490
What are the plans? Please. I must know everything.

367
00:24:26,490 --> 00:24:27,530
Well, the plans are settled.

368
00:24:27,530 --> 00:24:29,440
We'll marry here, and honeymoon in Europe.

369
00:24:29,450 --> 00:24:31,570
And then home to Manderley.

370
00:24:31,570 --> 00:24:32,570
Oh, my goodness.

371
00:24:32,570 --> 00:24:34,940
Have you ever heard of anything more romantic in your life?

372
00:24:34,950 --> 00:24:36,320
"Home to Manderley."

373
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:38,700
Oh, my goodness. It's out of a fairy tale.

374
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:42,240
All right. I'll go and make sure

375
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,950
your bags don't end up on the train.

376
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:46,530
- Do hurry. - You'll be fine.

377
00:24:46,530 --> 00:24:49,450
Yes, yes, go along. We have lots to talk about.

378
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:56,610
Well, goodness gracious, don't you work quickly?

379
00:24:57,650 --> 00:24:59,860
Have you been doing things you shouldn't?

380
00:25:00,610 --> 00:25:01,780
I don't know what you mean.

381
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:07,570
Well, you don't have a family, luckily, to explain it to.

382
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:09,860
I wash my hands of it.

383
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:12,700
Gonna have your work cut out for you at Manderley.

384
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:14,990
And, frankly, I don't think you're up to it.

385
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:18,030
- I can learn. - Let me tell you something, honey.

386
00:25:20,150 --> 00:25:22,280
When you trap a man between your legs,

387
00:25:22,650 --> 00:25:24,610
they don't stick around for long.

388
00:25:28,570 --> 00:25:30,070
Goodbye, Mrs. Van Hopper.

389
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:33,320
He's only marrying you because he doesn't want to go on living

390
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:36,400
in that big old house with her ghost!

391
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:38,280
I don't believe in ghosts.

392
00:26:40,990 --> 00:26:44,150
Oh, God. I hate it when they do this.

393
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:51,780
So much for keeping things quiet.

394
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:54,820
You know how she is, sir.

395
00:26:55,610 --> 00:26:58,280
There's a way things are done at Manderley.

396
00:26:59,450 --> 00:27:00,780
Darling, this is Frith.

397
00:27:01,150 --> 00:27:01,860
Hello.

398
00:27:09,450 --> 00:27:12,400
Let's do things properly, shall we? There we go.

399
00:27:12,860 --> 00:27:14,860
- What are you doing? - What? You don't like that?

400
00:27:15,030 --> 00:27:16,070
Up you go.

401
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,240
Don't, Max, put me down.

402
00:27:48,650 --> 00:27:49,780
Mrs. Danvers.

403
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:52,280
Welcome to Manderley.

404
00:27:53,530 --> 00:27:54,990
Hello. It's a pleasure.

405
00:28:02,990 --> 00:28:05,780
- Thank you. Thank you. - Tea is ready.

406
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:09,900
Danvers runs the house.

407
00:28:10,150 --> 00:28:12,150
Don't worry, she's not as scary as she seems.

408
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:16,570
Oh, Maxim, it's wonderful!

409
00:28:19,150 --> 00:28:20,030
Stop that.

410
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:24,280
There he is. The wanderer returns. Good to see you, Max.

411
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:26,820
- And you, Frank. - How was the trip?

412
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:30,740
Was rather eventful, as it turns out.

413
00:28:30,950 --> 00:28:33,570
- Frank Crawley, Mrs. de Winter. - It's a pleasure.

414
00:28:33,570 --> 00:28:34,860
Thank you. Hello.

415
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:36,240
Frank's the estate manager.

416
00:28:36,530 --> 00:28:37,990
The place would fall apart without him.

417
00:28:38,150 --> 00:28:40,740
Ah, no, no. He exaggerates. Ignore him.

418
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:45,820
I, I hate to be a bore, but I urgently need a few signatures.

419
00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:47,950
I promise I'll have him back to you in a jiffy.

420
00:28:49,110 --> 00:28:50,610
- Shall we? - Yes.

421
00:28:54,030 --> 00:28:57,990
Danvers, show Mrs. de Winter the house. Can you?

422
00:28:57,990 --> 00:28:59,440
Oh, no, that's all right. I'll wait.

423
00:28:59,450 --> 00:29:03,200
No, don't be silly. Go on. I'll catch you up.

424
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:15,150
The estate has been in the family for over 300 years.

425
00:29:16,030 --> 00:29:18,070
It was originally a gift from Henry VIII.

426
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:21,530
Extraordinary.

427
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:27,900
If there are guests, you may use the drawing room.

428
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:30,530
Don't forget to tell Frith to light the fires,

429
00:29:30,530 --> 00:29:32,780
but generally, Mr. de Winter prefers

430
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:35,700
to take his coffee here in the library.

431
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:39,740
Glad you're here, Mrs. Danvers. I'll...

432
00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:41,360
I'll Never remember all this.

434
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:47,740
Oh, I'm sure you won't disappoint him, madam,

435
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:49,280
if that's your concern.

436
00:29:50,650 --> 00:29:53,240
The de Winter family dates back to the Tudors.

437
00:29:53,490 --> 00:29:55,900
And, um, who's that?

438
00:29:57,070 --> 00:30:00,150
That's Caroline de Winter. Mr. de Winter's great aunt.

439
00:30:00,150 --> 00:30:01,400
She's very striking.

440
00:30:01,530 --> 00:30:03,610
Yes, and one of the first women

441
00:30:03,610 --> 00:30:05,700
to qualify as a doctor in England.

442
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,490
It's one of his favorites.

443
00:30:09,780 --> 00:30:11,240
Where does everyone sleep?

444
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:14,070
Maids in the attic, men below stairs,

445
00:30:14,070 --> 00:30:16,280
just as in your other houses, I presume.

446
00:30:17,950 --> 00:30:20,320
Never even seen a house like this.

447
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:25,450
Oh, I'm sorry. I thought you'd been a lady's maid.

448
00:30:26,450 --> 00:30:28,530
The master bedroom is now in the east wing.

449
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:47,530
What a... pretty pattern.

450
00:30:49,150 --> 00:30:53,450
This is Clarice. She'll look after you until your maid gets here.

451
00:30:53,990 --> 00:30:57,360
I don't have a maid, but I'm sure I'll manage without one.

452
00:30:58,610 --> 00:31:00,700
Well, I think you'll find you need one.

453
00:31:01,870 --> 00:31:04,970
Perhaps Clarice could take the position.

454
00:31:07,990 --> 00:31:09,310
You can't see the sea from here.

455
00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:10,930
No, you can't.

456
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:14,570
Should Mr. de Winter ask for his old wardrobe,

457
00:31:14,570 --> 00:31:16,600
I'm afraid you must tell him it wouldn't fit here.

458
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:18,770
The rooms on this side of the house are much smaller.

459
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:21,640
This wasn't his bedroom before?

460
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:26,390
No, no, no. No. Mrs. de Winter's rooms were in the west wing.

461
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:33,890
Well, it's a lovely room. Much too nice to stand empty.

462
00:31:34,150 --> 00:31:36,310
The guest rooms are never empty for very long.

463
00:31:39,450 --> 00:31:42,560
We did a lot of entertaining when the late Mrs. de Winter was alive.

464
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:45,600
The Manderley ball was quite an event.

465
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:49,020
I'll leave you with Clarice.

466
00:31:57,990 --> 00:31:59,270
Ask me a question.

467
00:32:01,950 --> 00:32:03,020
What sort of question?

468
00:32:05,110 --> 00:32:05,890
Anything.

469
00:32:08,070 --> 00:32:10,140
I have no secrets from you.

470
00:32:11,650 --> 00:32:14,520
Don't you think that's how it should be now that we're married?

471
00:32:15,990 --> 00:32:17,930
All marriages have their secrets.

472
00:32:22,110 --> 00:32:26,640
You can talk to me about her... if you want.

473
00:32:37,030 --> 00:32:38,020
Good night, darling.

474
00:33:46,870 --> 00:33:47,770
Maxim?

475
00:34:28,490 --> 00:34:29,310
Leave him.

476
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:33,140
It's dangerous to wake a sleepwalker.

477
00:35:49,950 --> 00:35:53,740
And nothing to worry about, but the stables will need reroofing

478
00:35:53,740 --> 00:35:55,310
because the tiles are spoiled...

479
00:35:57,150 --> 00:35:58,930
- Good morning, darling. - Good morning.

480
00:35:59,070 --> 00:36:00,720
- Sleep well? - Yes, not bad.

481
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:04,310
Come.

482
00:36:06,110 --> 00:36:08,780
- How are you settling in? - Very well, thank you.

483
00:36:08,780 --> 00:36:10,310
Good. Good.

484
00:36:11,490 --> 00:36:14,720
I'll... see you up there, shall I?

485
00:36:14,860 --> 00:36:16,930
- Won't be a sec. - Mrs. de Winter.

486
00:36:16,950 --> 00:36:17,930
Mr. Crawley.

487
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:20,970
Frank. It's Frank.

488
00:36:24,530 --> 00:36:25,780
I should have got up earlier.

489
00:36:25,780 --> 00:36:28,220
- We could have had breakfast together. - Oh, that's all right.

490
00:36:30,860 --> 00:36:32,390
Did you know you sleepwalk?

491
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:38,390
Enjoy your breakfast.

492
00:37:02,110 --> 00:37:02,890
Jasper!

493
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:14,970
Where are you going? Jasper!

494
00:37:17,530 --> 00:37:19,140
Jasper, where have you gone?

499
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:00,270
I'm sorry to disturb you all...

500
00:39:01,070 --> 00:39:02,990
Clarice, have you seen Mr. de Winter?

501
00:39:02,990 --> 00:39:05,650
And do you have a plaster? I've cut my hand.

502
00:39:05,650 --> 00:39:06,350
Let me see.

503
00:39:06,610 --> 00:39:09,020
- Really, it's nothing. I'm fine. - Oh, my. One moment.

504
00:39:10,950 --> 00:39:12,270
Since you're here, madam,

505
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:14,930
may I have your approval for today's menus?

506
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:20,720
Yes. Good. Very suitable. Very nice indeed.

507
00:39:21,110 --> 00:39:24,220
- And the sauce for the roast veal? - Yes, that looks excellent.

508
00:39:24,650 --> 00:39:26,350
No, but I've left it blank, you see?

509
00:39:27,780 --> 00:39:31,060
Mrs. de Winter was most particular about her sauces.

510
00:39:33,150 --> 00:39:34,100
Right. Well, um...

511
00:39:36,950 --> 00:39:39,310
We'll have whatever Mrs. de Winter would have had. Thank you.

512
00:39:39,650 --> 00:39:40,600
Very well, madam.

513
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:45,390
- There we go. - Thank you very much.

515
00:40:19,860 --> 00:40:21,390
Is everything all right, darling?

516
00:40:21,740 --> 00:40:26,560
I was thinking of... ordering some new undergarments from London.

517
00:40:27,990 --> 00:40:31,220
Something lacy and a nightgown.

518
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:36,470
When have I ever complained about what you wear?

519
00:40:45,780 --> 00:40:48,020
This is nice, isn't it? Just us.

520
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:50,100
It's almost like we're back on our honeymoon.

521
00:40:52,110 --> 00:40:53,560
Oh, I miss it. Don't you?

522
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:57,470
Driving, the exploring, little cafes?

523
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:01,600
Seeing some funny old hotel and just staying there.

524
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:03,720
That's not real life, darling.

525
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:08,390
- Jasper! Jasper! - I'll get him.

526
00:41:08,530 --> 00:41:10,890
No, just leave him. He'll find his own way back.

527
00:41:11,150 --> 00:41:12,990
It's so steep. What if he falls?

528
00:41:12,990 --> 00:41:14,220
I said leave him!

529
00:41:17,740 --> 00:41:18,720
Jasper!

530
00:41:20,740 --> 00:41:21,600
Jasper!

531
00:41:23,820 --> 00:41:24,850
Jasper, come here!

532
00:41:30,820 --> 00:41:31,640
Jasper!

533
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:46,350
Jasper, come out of there.

534
00:42:13,990 --> 00:42:15,270
Jasper, come here.

535
00:42:16,990 --> 00:42:19,310
All right, get something to tie you with.

537
00:42:44,860 --> 00:42:45,680
Hello?

538
00:42:58,570 --> 00:43:00,640
There's nothing here, silly.

539
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:19,060
I'm...

540
00:43:19,110 --> 00:43:21,720
I didn't realize that anyone lived here.

541
00:43:22,030 --> 00:43:24,720
No, I don't, do I? Live up in the keeper's cottage.

542
00:43:25,650 --> 00:43:28,020
I've been digging for shells since forenoon.

543
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:30,720
Oh, you've been digging for shells? Huh?

544
00:43:32,820 --> 00:43:33,890
No. I just, I...

545
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:37,510
I needed something to tie my dog with.

546
00:43:37,510 --> 00:43:38,600
I'll be out of your way in a moment.

547
00:43:38,780 --> 00:43:40,600
- He ain't yourn. - Oh, no.

548
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:43,140
- He's Mr. de Winter's dog. - No.

549
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:44,930
That's her dog.

550
00:43:46,990 --> 00:43:48,810
She don't come here no more.

551
00:43:49,610 --> 00:43:53,640
She... she gone into the sea, ain't she?

552
00:43:55,150 --> 00:43:56,600
She drowned.

553
00:43:59,900 --> 00:44:01,220
You ain't like her.

554
00:44:05,650 --> 00:44:07,890
Yes. Come on, Jasper.

555
00:44:09,150 --> 00:44:11,350
I never said nothin', did I?

556
00:44:12,610 --> 00:44:14,180
Come on, Jasper. Come on.

557
00:44:26,700 --> 00:44:28,520
I know why you didn't want to come down here.

558
00:44:31,820 --> 00:44:33,020
How am I supposed to know?

559
00:44:33,990 --> 00:44:36,060
How am I supposed to know anything if you don't tell me?

560
00:44:36,700 --> 00:44:39,060
- That's supposed to be locked. - There was someone in there.

561
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:43,220
Probably just the keeper's son, Ben. He's harmless enough.

562
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:44,270
Maxim, I...

563
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:09,970
Oh, God!

564
00:45:13,070 --> 00:45:14,890
- That's in Italy. - There he is.

565
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:17,930
Oh, yes. That was just after the wedding.

566
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:22,180
What a nice plain frock.

567
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:26,390
Look, Max was right. You're not at all what I expected.

568
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:29,470
And you're looking better, old man.

569
00:45:29,780 --> 00:45:30,930
Not so drawn.

570
00:45:31,240 --> 00:45:32,690
- Please. - Bosh!

571
00:45:32,700 --> 00:45:35,890
Everyone knows you were a perfect wreck six months ago.

572
00:45:37,150 --> 00:45:39,430
Here, Granny, have you seen these?

573
00:45:39,780 --> 00:45:41,180
Look, aren't they lovely?

574
00:45:41,860 --> 00:45:43,390
- Goodness! - Yes.

575
00:45:43,650 --> 00:45:45,310
So, these were from our wedding.

576
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:49,060
What's all this I hear about you not hunting?

577
00:45:49,780 --> 00:45:51,490
Oh, no, I'm afraid I don't ride.

578
00:45:51,490 --> 00:45:54,470
Oh, but you must! Or you'll miss out on all the fun.

579
00:45:54,820 --> 00:45:56,350
Come and stay. I can teach you.

580
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:58,320
You won't find a finer horsewoman in the county.

581
00:45:58,320 --> 00:45:59,720
Do dry up, Giles.

582
00:45:59,820 --> 00:46:01,190
Yes, it might shock my sister to learn

583
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:03,310
that not everyone shares her idea of fun.

584
00:46:03,780 --> 00:46:07,140
Well, whatever her idea of fun, she certainly deserves to have some.

585
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:11,810
Well, actually, I've been thinking I might revive the ball.

586
00:46:17,450 --> 00:46:18,560
What a marvelous idea.

587
00:46:19,570 --> 00:46:21,270
That's not something we discussed.

588
00:46:22,070 --> 00:46:24,470
Oh, don't be so damn miserable.

589
00:46:24,990 --> 00:46:26,430
You used to love it.

590
00:46:27,070 --> 00:46:29,640
You can hold it in honor of your new bride.

591
00:46:33,650 --> 00:46:34,310
Fine.

592
00:46:36,150 --> 00:46:37,930
Well, that's settled, then.

593
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:40,640
- To our new hostess. - Yeah. To our new hostess.

594
00:46:42,280 --> 00:46:45,350
Are you staying at Manderley, dear?

595
00:46:45,700 --> 00:46:46,850
- She lives here. - Oh, no.

596
00:46:46,860 --> 00:46:49,470
- Remember, Granny? - Granny, we introduced you.

597
00:46:49,650 --> 00:46:51,680
She's Maxim's wife.

598
00:46:52,990 --> 00:46:55,020
No, she is not.

599
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:05,350
She's not Maxim's wife.

600
00:47:06,900 --> 00:47:08,810
What a silly notion.

601
00:47:11,900 --> 00:47:15,600
Well, it's... good news about the ball, uh...

602
00:47:16,030 --> 00:47:17,520
It's been far too long.

603
00:47:17,900 --> 00:47:19,600
I don't remember you.

604
00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:22,140
Oh, no, I...

605
00:47:22,740 --> 00:47:24,930
We haven't met before.

606
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:29,470
Maxim, who is this child?

607
00:47:29,860 --> 00:47:32,310
Oh, Christ. All right, let's get Granny home now.

608
00:47:32,740 --> 00:47:34,560
What have you done with Rebecca?

609
00:47:34,990 --> 00:47:36,240
- Leave it. - No, I've got it!

610
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:37,780
I want to see Rebecca.

611
00:47:37,780 --> 00:47:39,400
- Please, leave me alone! - She just gets a little...

612
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:42,220
it's the time of day, and the weather...

613
00:47:44,610 --> 00:47:46,260
- Oh, my! - I just want to...

614
00:47:46,260 --> 00:47:47,280
Get her in the car.

615
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:49,100
I'll put her in the car. You go and talk to her.

616
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:51,060
Listen, let's get in the car, Granny. Come on.

617
00:47:51,070 --> 00:47:54,180
This is from the flower room. I hope that's all right.

618
00:47:54,200 --> 00:47:55,770
- Thank you. - Look, I apologize.

619
00:47:55,950 --> 00:47:59,020
I'd forgotten how fond our grandmother was of Rebecca.

620
00:47:59,950 --> 00:48:00,570
I'm fine.

621
00:48:00,570 --> 00:48:03,680
She was just one of those bloody annoying people.

622
00:48:03,950 --> 00:48:05,270
Irresistible to everybody.

623
00:48:05,270 --> 00:48:08,770
The men, women, children, animals.

624
00:48:09,860 --> 00:48:12,890
Us mere mortals couldn't hope to compete.

625
00:48:44,780 --> 00:48:46,100
- Sir. - Why is he crying?

626
00:48:46,610 --> 00:48:48,610
Sir, one of the porcelain pieces

627
00:48:48,610 --> 00:48:49,820
is missing from the morning room,

628
00:48:49,820 --> 00:48:52,070
and now Danvers is calling for the boy's dismissal.

629
00:48:52,070 --> 00:48:53,350
- But it wasn't... - Which piece?

630
00:48:53,570 --> 00:48:54,640
We're not sure, sir.

631
00:48:55,450 --> 00:48:56,270
Danvers!

632
00:48:57,450 --> 00:49:00,220
- Is everything all right? - Yes, it's fine.

633
00:49:00,360 --> 00:49:02,300
Something rather's just gone missing from the morning room.

634
00:49:02,300 --> 00:49:02,880
That's all.

635
00:49:03,030 --> 00:49:05,930
- Danvers! - What is it? What's gone missing?

636
00:49:08,610 --> 00:49:10,390
What on earth makes you think Robert took it?

637
00:49:11,570 --> 00:49:13,990
The Dresden is extremely valuable, sir.

638
00:49:13,990 --> 00:49:16,150
- But it wasn't me! - That piece alone is worth £100.

639
00:49:16,150 --> 00:49:18,970
- Sir, I find it most unlikely... - Then who, Frith?

640
00:49:19,990 --> 00:49:23,100
The between maid isn't allowed in the morning room. I do it.

641
00:49:23,820 --> 00:49:25,990
When Mrs. de Winter was alive, we did it together.

642
00:49:25,990 --> 00:49:27,810
- All Frith is saying... - It was me.

643
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:35,180
I broke it. It broke.

644
00:49:35,900 --> 00:49:38,430
It was an accident. It fell.

645
00:49:41,820 --> 00:49:43,850
Well, there we go.

646
00:49:44,650 --> 00:49:46,270
Robert, you're off the hook.

647
00:49:51,570 --> 00:49:52,810
Where are the pieces, madam?

648
00:49:54,650 --> 00:49:57,390
In the bureau drawer at the back.

649
00:49:57,860 --> 00:50:00,150
Send them to London, Danvers. See if anything can be done.

650
00:50:00,150 --> 00:50:01,100
Certainly, sir.

651
00:50:01,450 --> 00:50:04,780
And may I suggest, should anything like this happen again,

652
00:50:04,780 --> 00:50:06,810
that Mrs. de Winter tell me herself.

653
00:50:08,280 --> 00:50:09,770
If we're all quite finished?

655
00:52:06,490 --> 00:52:07,350
Oh, Frank.

656
00:52:08,450 --> 00:52:09,310
Mrs. de Winter.

657
00:52:10,650 --> 00:52:12,430
I thought you'd gone up to London with Max.

658
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:14,390
He's in London?

659
00:52:14,990 --> 00:52:17,680
Yeah. Taking care of some paperwork.

660
00:52:19,240 --> 00:52:21,520
He asked me to put a padlock on here. I nearly locked you in.

661
00:52:23,320 --> 00:52:24,140
It's a shame.

662
00:52:26,110 --> 00:52:27,930
This place going to ruin.

663
00:52:28,900 --> 00:52:32,310
Well... no boat now.

664
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:36,850
Max doesn't like to sail.

665
00:52:53,150 --> 00:52:54,470
Ben said she drowned.

666
00:52:57,360 --> 00:52:59,430
I'm sorry. I assumed you knew.

667
00:53:00,450 --> 00:53:04,220
- No. - Ah, it's... It was brutal weather.

668
00:53:05,780 --> 00:53:07,600
Even for her. She was an excellent sailor.

669
00:53:08,860 --> 00:53:09,850
The boat went down.

670
00:53:11,700 --> 00:53:12,720
They never recovered it.

671
00:53:14,320 --> 00:53:17,770
She washed up in Edgcumbe some... two months later.

672
00:53:18,570 --> 00:53:21,310
Two months? My God!

673
00:53:22,900 --> 00:53:23,970
Poor Maxim.

674
00:53:24,820 --> 00:53:27,770
Drove him down there myself to identify the body.

675
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:33,180
You know, you really mustn't dwell on the past.

676
00:53:33,530 --> 00:53:35,770
You're so good for Max. He's a changed man.

677
00:53:37,950 --> 00:53:39,310
She must have been so afraid.

678
00:53:41,570 --> 00:53:42,520
Out there alone.

679
00:53:43,950 --> 00:53:45,140
She wasn't afraid of anything.

680
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:57,310
Can I ask you something, Frank? And promise to tell me the truth.

681
00:53:58,360 --> 00:54:00,890
Hardly fair, isn't it. Don't know what you're gonna ask me.

682
00:54:02,360 --> 00:54:04,100
Was Rebecca very beautiful?

683
00:54:08,490 --> 00:54:09,180
Yes.

684
00:54:12,650 --> 00:54:14,140
Yes, I suppose she was...

685
00:54:15,360 --> 00:54:18,350
the most beautiful creature I ever saw in my life.

687
00:55:13,990 --> 00:55:15,930
It is beautiful, isn't it?

688
00:55:18,110 --> 00:55:19,810
I keep it just the way it was.

689
00:55:21,240 --> 00:55:23,430
It's as if she'd just gone out for a while.

690
00:55:24,780 --> 00:55:25,850
You startled me.

691
00:55:28,110 --> 00:55:29,430
This was her favorite.

692
00:55:32,490 --> 00:55:34,310
I laid it out for her that night.

693
00:55:42,740 --> 00:55:44,140
Go on, hold it.

694
00:55:45,740 --> 00:55:46,560
Touch it.

695
00:55:51,950 --> 00:55:54,430
She wouldn't have a lady's maid, you know.

696
00:55:54,700 --> 00:55:56,520
"I don't want anyone but you, Danny."

697
00:55:58,950 --> 00:56:00,680
Do you see how tall she was?

698
00:56:06,530 --> 00:56:08,720
Hmm. She could wear anything with a figure like hers.

699
00:56:11,110 --> 00:56:14,970
I'd brush her hair for her every evening.

700
00:56:18,320 --> 00:56:20,600
"Come on, Danny, hair drill." she'd say.

701
00:56:22,320 --> 00:56:23,810
I'd stand behind her

702
00:56:24,990 --> 00:56:28,310
and brush away for 20 minutes at a time.

703
00:56:29,820 --> 00:56:32,890
That great mass of dark hair.

704
00:56:37,610 --> 00:56:38,680
He joined in.

705
00:56:40,820 --> 00:56:42,350
He loved to do that for her.

706
00:56:44,530 --> 00:56:47,470
They'd be dressing for dinner, guests waiting downstairs.

707
00:56:47,820 --> 00:56:49,560
"Harder, Max, harder!"

708
00:56:50,650 --> 00:56:52,890
And he'd roar with laughter.

709
00:56:54,950 --> 00:56:56,970
He was always laughing back then.

710
00:57:02,860 --> 00:57:04,180
Does he brush your hair?

711
00:57:05,990 --> 00:57:06,680
No.

712
00:57:10,070 --> 00:57:12,820
Mrs. Danvers,

713
00:57:12,820 --> 00:57:15,070
does Mr. de Winter ask you to keep the room like this?

714
00:57:15,070 --> 00:57:16,180
He doesn't have to.

715
00:57:17,490 --> 00:57:18,600
She's still here.

716
00:57:20,900 --> 00:57:21,770
Can you feel her?

717
00:57:24,200 --> 00:57:26,640
I wonder what she's thinking about you.

718
00:57:27,490 --> 00:57:31,560
Taking her husband and... using her name.

719
00:57:34,820 --> 00:57:37,110
- I'm sure she'd want him to be happy. - Happy?

720
00:57:37,110 --> 00:57:38,390
No, he'll never be happy.

721
00:57:41,820 --> 00:57:43,640
She was the love of his life.

722
00:58:15,650 --> 00:58:16,310
Maxim?

723
00:58:32,740 --> 00:58:33,640
Good morning, madam.

724
00:58:35,110 --> 00:58:38,520
Oh, dear! You've been scratchin'.

725
00:59:16,990 --> 00:59:17,770
Have we missed ya?

726
00:59:22,320 --> 00:59:25,640
Hello! You must be the new Mrs. de Winter.

727
00:59:26,240 --> 00:59:28,100
Uh, I think there's been a mistake.

728
00:59:28,610 --> 00:59:31,640
- Mr. de Winter's in London. - He's left you on your own?

729
00:59:32,070 --> 00:59:34,720
Isn't he afraid some bounder might come and carry you off?

730
00:59:35,240 --> 00:59:37,430
I'm Jack Favell. How do you do?

731
00:59:43,030 --> 00:59:45,100
Well, did you want to leave your card?

732
00:59:46,450 --> 00:59:48,740
And too polite to tell me to bugger off.

733
00:59:48,740 --> 00:59:50,270
You are a sweetheart.

734
00:59:50,490 --> 00:59:52,600
Not to worry. I just popped by to see Danny.

735
00:59:52,950 --> 00:59:54,430
She's invited me for tea.

736
00:59:55,450 --> 00:59:58,680
- I'm horribly early, though. - Mrs. Danvers?

737
00:59:59,360 --> 01:00:01,320
That's why I thought I'd better hover around out here,

738
01:00:01,320 --> 01:00:03,680
otherwise I might get a smack on the wrist.

739
01:00:10,700 --> 01:00:13,560
Mr. Favell? Where are you going?

740
01:00:15,110 --> 01:00:15,990
Charlie, come on.

741
01:00:15,990 --> 01:00:17,390
- Excuse me, Mr. Favell! - Coming, sir.

742
01:00:19,360 --> 01:00:20,970
- Phillippa! - Come on in, Charlie.

743
01:00:22,610 --> 01:00:23,470
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Stand down.

744
01:00:23,990 --> 01:00:26,100
- Easy, Starlight, easy. - Steady.

745
01:00:26,200 --> 01:00:28,430
You've got too much energy. They've been neglecting you.

746
01:00:29,150 --> 01:00:30,390
That's not a surprise.

747
01:00:30,740 --> 01:00:33,520
Rebecca was the only one who could handle you, wasn't she, old boy?

748
01:00:33,650 --> 01:00:34,520
Yes.

749
01:00:35,450 --> 01:00:36,520
You knew Rebecca?

750
01:00:38,610 --> 01:00:41,140
She's my cousin. Was.

751
01:00:43,740 --> 01:00:44,430
That's it.

752
01:00:45,450 --> 01:00:46,970
Let's take one of the horses out for a turn.

753
01:00:47,070 --> 01:00:49,720
Oh, no. I really... I don't know how.

754
01:00:50,030 --> 01:00:54,060
Well, I can teach you. Or have you something better to be doing?

755
01:00:54,820 --> 01:00:56,650
- How do I... - On three, swing your leg over.

756
01:00:56,650 --> 01:00:57,680
- Ready? - Do you...

757
01:00:58,280 --> 01:00:59,640
One, two, three.

758
01:01:01,490 --> 01:01:04,470
Can you give me a stirrup? All right.

759
01:01:04,780 --> 01:01:05,350
Are you...

760
01:01:07,900 --> 01:01:09,020
We won't go too fast.

761
01:01:15,780 --> 01:01:16,470
That's it.

762
01:01:19,990 --> 01:01:20,770
How do you feel?

763
01:01:24,360 --> 01:01:26,970
- Right, now you take the reins. - Oh, all right.

764
01:01:27,650 --> 01:01:29,180
- Be nice and loose. - Yeah.

765
01:01:29,320 --> 01:01:31,940
And low. That's it.

766
01:01:31,950 --> 01:01:33,520
- Got it. - Right here on your lap.

767
01:01:34,780 --> 01:01:37,850
Now, very important. Squeeze the thighs.

768
01:01:38,610 --> 01:01:40,020
Let the beast know you're there.

769
01:01:41,700 --> 01:01:43,390
You're gonna be wickedly sore this evening.

770
01:01:44,240 --> 01:01:45,850
Now just move with me. Ready?

771
01:01:46,700 --> 01:01:47,310
All right.

772
01:01:50,700 --> 01:01:52,100
Darling, may I ask you something?

773
01:01:53,030 --> 01:01:55,770
Has Max ever talked to you about the accident?

774
01:01:58,750 --> 01:02:01,670
And he never mentioned Rebecca's trip to London that day?

775
01:02:02,790 --> 01:02:03,860
No.

776
01:02:05,280 --> 01:02:07,030
No, he won't speak of it at all.

777
01:02:09,990 --> 01:02:12,810
So, you don't know if he saw her

778
01:02:13,240 --> 01:02:15,270
when she got back that night,

779
01:02:16,100 --> 01:02:17,820
before she took the boat out?

780
01:02:18,680 --> 01:02:19,720
No.

781
01:02:25,920 --> 01:02:28,440
There's something she wanted to tell me.

782
01:02:29,310 --> 01:02:31,260
Something very important.

783
01:02:34,820 --> 01:02:37,150
And not knowing what it was...

784
01:02:39,880 --> 01:02:41,930
That's really been a hard thing.

785
01:02:46,200 --> 01:02:48,970
I'm not doing my roguish image any good, am I?

786
01:02:51,590 --> 01:02:53,920
You should come back and ask Maxim.

787
01:02:53,970 --> 01:02:55,350
Well, I would.

788
01:02:58,110 --> 01:03:01,090
But I'm afraid I'm a little bit banned from visiting.

789
01:03:01,910 --> 01:03:05,270
In fact, it's best if you don't mention my being here at all today.

790
01:03:05,340 --> 01:03:08,280
I... I thought you were friends.

791
01:03:08,530 --> 01:03:09,990
Not really, no.

792
01:03:13,710 --> 01:03:17,550
And I would hate for either one of us

793
01:03:17,760 --> 01:03:20,760
to be on the receiving end of that famous temper of his.

794
01:03:20,760 --> 01:03:22,870
I don't know what you're talking about.

795
01:03:24,990 --> 01:03:27,170
Well, it is still early days.

796
01:03:32,170 --> 01:03:35,650
Well, I better not keep Danny waiting. You know how she is.

797
01:04:06,490 --> 01:04:08,230
Why did you invite him?

798
01:04:10,050 --> 01:04:11,500
Jack Favell.

799
01:04:12,070 --> 01:04:13,730
You asked him for tea,

800
01:04:14,090 --> 01:04:17,800
knowing full well Mr. de Winter has banned him from the property.

801
01:04:18,350 --> 01:04:20,600
There must be some mistake, madam.

802
01:04:21,120 --> 01:04:24,430
I haven't seen Mr. Favell for over a year.

803
01:04:55,600 --> 01:04:56,780
Hello, Frith.

804
01:04:56,900 --> 01:05:01,180
Hello, sir. Mr. Favell has made an unannounced visit.

805
01:05:05,310 --> 01:05:07,110
I don't care what she told Frith!

806
01:05:07,110 --> 01:05:10,200
Mr. Favell told me that she invited him here.

807
01:05:10,200 --> 01:05:12,410
Well, Mrs. Danvers, I suppose she forced you

808
01:05:12,410 --> 01:05:13,840
to go riding with him, did she?

809
01:05:13,840 --> 01:05:15,240
No, I can explain!

810
01:05:15,240 --> 01:05:18,160
- Explain what? - I was going to tell you, I was.

811
01:05:18,350 --> 01:05:22,340
Want to tell me how you dragged him down to the boathouse?

812
01:05:23,210 --> 01:05:26,440
Parade your fancy new night clothes for him?

813
01:05:26,440 --> 01:05:28,510
How could you even think that?

814
01:05:28,510 --> 01:05:31,280
I'd never have let him on the property

815
01:05:31,280 --> 01:05:33,810
if I'd known it would upset you, Maxim.

816
01:05:34,090 --> 01:05:37,140
Please. I love you.

817
01:05:40,610 --> 01:05:41,820
Oh, do you?

818
01:05:42,630 --> 01:05:44,310
Mrs. Danvers invited him here.

819
01:05:44,320 --> 01:05:47,580
I don't wanna hear another word about Danvers!

820
01:06:11,560 --> 01:06:12,740
Come in.

821
01:06:18,440 --> 01:06:19,800
Mrs. Danvers.

822
01:06:20,490 --> 01:06:22,410
I've come to give you your notice.

823
01:06:25,730 --> 01:06:27,880
Has Mr. de Winter agreed to this?

824
01:06:27,880 --> 01:06:29,670
The decision is mine.

825
01:06:35,660 --> 01:06:37,030
You see...

826
01:06:38,580 --> 01:06:41,700
I looked after Rebecca when she was a little girl.

827
01:06:42,540 --> 01:06:45,610
We came here together when she was first married.

828
01:06:48,530 --> 01:06:50,250
I was her friend.

829
01:06:52,310 --> 01:06:54,600
Someone to share her secrets.

830
01:06:56,900 --> 01:06:59,090
Bond like that can't be broke.

831
01:06:59,670 --> 01:07:02,790
Can't be replaced. I was wrong to expect that from you.

832
01:07:07,540 --> 01:07:09,720
Well, you'll find another house.

833
01:07:10,580 --> 01:07:11,680
No.

834
01:07:14,010 --> 01:07:15,240
We women,

835
01:07:15,740 --> 01:07:19,740
we can either marry or go into service,

836
01:07:20,900 --> 01:07:22,670
and I'm too old for either.

837
01:07:23,780 --> 01:07:26,160
Well, we'll make sure that you're provided for.

838
01:07:26,160 --> 01:07:28,800
Oh, it's not about money. It's...

839
01:07:29,350 --> 01:07:33,450
This wasn't a job for me. Rebecca was my life.

840
01:07:36,590 --> 01:07:37,800
Yes.

841
01:07:38,100 --> 01:07:40,210
I'm sorry if I failed you.

842
01:07:40,210 --> 01:07:41,600
I didn't mean to let you down.

843
01:07:41,600 --> 01:07:45,260
It was just you seemed so set on doing things your own way.

844
01:07:46,110 --> 01:07:48,500
No. This is all very new to me.

845
01:07:48,800 --> 01:07:50,830
The house, the staff...

846
01:07:51,530 --> 01:07:52,100
I just...

847
01:07:52,100 --> 01:07:57,080
I think that Mr. de Winter hoped that you'd help me.

848
01:07:58,480 --> 01:08:00,670
You didn't ask for my help.

849
01:08:07,130 --> 01:08:08,270
Well...

850
01:08:10,910 --> 01:08:12,800
what if I asked for it now?

851
01:08:47,660 --> 01:08:48,940
I'm sorry.

852
01:08:50,640 --> 01:08:52,110
I was an idiot.

853
01:08:52,800 --> 01:08:54,360
It's not your fault.

854
01:08:56,200 --> 01:08:57,910
I know it wasn't.

855
01:09:08,540 --> 01:09:09,830
I'm so sorry.

858
01:09:27,860 --> 01:09:29,010
Okay.

860
01:09:33,820 --> 01:09:37,530
Very good, madam. Perfect. I'll have them printed at once.

861
01:09:37,810 --> 01:09:40,420
Oh, and we must let Voce in London know before Friday

862
01:09:40,420 --> 01:09:42,510
if you wish them to make your costume.

863
01:09:42,510 --> 01:09:46,060
Yes. I'm afraid I'm drawing a bit of a blank there.

864
01:09:47,880 --> 01:09:51,920
Well, you'll be the most important lady at the ball.

865
01:09:51,920 --> 01:09:55,730
- So, choose something with that in mind. - Yes.

866
01:09:56,490 --> 01:09:58,460
Oh, be confident.

867
01:09:58,880 --> 01:10:01,400
Let them see your natural beauty.

868
01:10:04,570 --> 01:10:05,780
Madam?

869
01:10:06,670 --> 01:10:08,960
If it's not too forward of me...

870
01:10:09,960 --> 01:10:14,110
Mrs. Danvers said you'd not picked out what to wear yet, and...

871
01:10:14,980 --> 01:10:17,270
I wondered if you'd want an idea.

872
01:10:18,080 --> 01:10:21,770
Yes, please, anything. Sit down.

873
01:10:23,560 --> 01:10:27,150
Just... the old paintings in the gallery.

874
01:10:27,750 --> 01:10:31,260
I always thought they'd make the most beautiful costume.

875
01:10:31,580 --> 01:10:34,330
Especially the lady in the red dress.

876
01:10:40,140 --> 01:10:41,840
Brilliant choice.

877
01:10:42,430 --> 01:10:43,840
Clarice informed me.

878
01:10:43,840 --> 01:10:48,610
And if I may say so, one worthy of the lady of this house.

879
01:10:53,560 --> 01:10:55,490
I do apologize.

882
01:11:23,910 --> 01:11:26,370
Right. Will you take this down to Mrs. Danvers?

883
01:11:26,370 --> 01:11:27,960
- Make sure she has everything. - Right.

884
01:11:27,960 --> 01:11:30,290
- Thank you very much. - And if you go through to the house...

885
01:11:30,290 --> 01:11:31,260
- Oh, sorry. - I'm sorry!

886
01:11:31,270 --> 01:11:33,700
- Welcome. Welcome. - Are you quite all right?

887
01:11:33,700 --> 01:11:36,570
- Yes. There's bit of a wind, Frank. - Well, yes.

888
01:11:36,570 --> 01:11:38,400
- Hope it doesn't rain. - It'll come to nothing, I'm sure.

889
01:11:38,560 --> 01:11:39,780
Oh, dear.

891
01:11:58,360 --> 01:12:02,040
- What? Hands off! Don't! - Can't I just see?

892
01:12:02,040 --> 01:12:04,250
No, no, no, no, no, you'll ruin the surprise.

893
01:12:04,250 --> 01:12:06,230
You know I don't like surprises.

894
01:12:06,250 --> 01:12:09,460
Well, you'll like this one.

895
01:12:10,080 --> 01:12:11,640
You won't recognize me.

896
01:12:15,590 --> 01:12:17,070
I'm so proud of you.

897
01:12:21,830 --> 01:12:24,380
Now, don't you leave me down there too long.

898
01:12:24,380 --> 01:12:26,670
Then get out so I can get ready.

899
01:12:53,740 --> 01:12:54,900
Here you go.

900
01:12:56,040 --> 01:12:57,410
No, I couldn't.

901
01:12:57,410 --> 01:12:59,760
Don't be silly. It's all right, I won't tell anyone.

902
01:13:02,900 --> 01:13:05,010
No, no, no, no, go away! You can't come in!

903
01:13:05,070 --> 01:13:07,550
The guests are arriving, ma'am.

904
01:13:07,600 --> 01:13:10,220
Oh, all right. Let's greet them.

905
01:13:10,270 --> 01:13:13,550
Please inform them madam will be down presently.

906
01:13:15,030 --> 01:13:16,260
Very good.

907
01:13:18,790 --> 01:13:21,480
- What are you doing lurking over here? - Nothing.

908
01:13:21,480 --> 01:13:24,190
- It's just like old times, isn't it? - Mmm, it's good.

909
01:13:24,190 --> 01:13:25,420
Where's your outfit?

910
01:13:25,430 --> 01:13:27,460
- This is my outfit, Giles. - It's marvelous.

911
01:13:27,460 --> 01:13:29,240
Palaver! Oh, champagne.

912
01:13:29,460 --> 01:13:32,040
- Late as usual. - So, what's your excuse?

913
01:13:33,140 --> 01:13:34,770
Tree down across the drive. Had to get it moved.

914
01:13:34,770 --> 01:13:36,410
No, no, for this.

915
01:13:37,410 --> 01:13:39,580
But I wear it every year, mate.

916
01:13:53,720 --> 01:13:56,390
All right. Finally. Hey, here she comes.

917
01:14:20,810 --> 01:14:22,630
How do you do, Mr. de Winter?

918
01:14:36,070 --> 01:14:38,050
Is this some kind of joke?

919
01:14:39,530 --> 01:14:42,830
Of course not. It's the painting. I thought...

920
01:14:42,830 --> 01:14:44,100
Go and change.

921
01:14:46,370 --> 01:14:47,940
What is it? What have I...

922
01:14:47,940 --> 01:14:51,440
Go and change now.

923
01:14:53,390 --> 01:14:54,080
I don't understand.

924
01:14:54,090 --> 01:14:56,580
- What have I done wrong? - I said now!

925
01:15:10,120 --> 01:15:13,910
I'm sorry. Please, madam, I never knew.

926
01:15:13,910 --> 01:15:16,170
It was Mrs. Danvers' idea.

927
01:15:24,730 --> 01:15:27,580
Rebecca wore this before, didn't she?

928
01:15:27,580 --> 01:15:30,880
Mrs. Danvers said he'd be so pleased and

929
01:15:31,570 --> 01:15:33,850
you'd be so pleased.

930
01:15:40,790 --> 01:15:42,100
Hold that.

931
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:47,430
- That's most unfortunate. - It was uncanny, wasn't it?

932
01:15:54,900 --> 01:15:58,790
- No, I can't. - Oh, bosh! Darling, you have to.

933
01:15:59,220 --> 01:16:00,360
No.

934
01:16:01,440 --> 01:16:03,600
It's not as bad as all that.

935
01:16:04,290 --> 01:16:06,160
You don't understand, I can't.

936
01:16:06,840 --> 01:16:08,390
Not after this. Not after what I've done.

937
01:16:08,390 --> 01:16:10,460
How were you to know?

938
01:16:10,570 --> 01:16:11,950
Now, wash your face,

939
01:16:11,950 --> 01:16:14,650
and I'll find you something to wear, all right?

940
01:16:15,450 --> 01:16:16,650
I should've known.

941
01:16:17,220 --> 01:16:19,730
- I should never have worn it. - Pull yourself together.

942
01:16:20,320 --> 01:16:22,820
You can sit up here all night feeling sorry for yourself,

943
01:16:22,820 --> 01:16:24,160
or you can come downstairs with me

944
01:16:24,160 --> 01:16:26,830
and have a good old laugh about it, hmm?

945
01:16:33,750 --> 01:16:35,280
His face...

946
01:16:37,290 --> 01:16:40,490
He wouldn't have spoken like that to her.

947
01:16:41,610 --> 01:16:43,680
You're very different people,

948
01:16:44,030 --> 01:16:46,280
and that's nothing to be ashamed of.

949
01:16:48,060 --> 01:16:49,280
- Okay. - Come on.

950
01:16:49,280 --> 01:16:52,310
You're not on the continent now. Let's have a stiff upper lip.

951
01:16:52,310 --> 01:16:54,550
- What? - Oh, yes.

952
01:16:55,640 --> 01:16:56,750
This'll do.

953
01:16:59,840 --> 01:17:01,160
I'll be all right.

954
01:17:02,100 --> 01:17:03,260
Good show.

955
01:17:05,220 --> 01:17:06,710
- I'll see you downstairs. - Yes.

956
01:17:06,710 --> 01:17:08,300
- Yes? - Yes.

957
01:17:40,910 --> 01:17:42,430
Nothing would make me happy...

958
01:17:44,110 --> 01:17:47,150
Lord Crowan, Lady Crowan, may I present Mrs. de Winter.

959
01:17:47,150 --> 01:17:50,680
Oh, rotten luck about your frock not turning up.

960
01:17:50,680 --> 01:17:53,300
- Yes. - Oh, never mind. You look lovely,

961
01:17:53,300 --> 01:17:56,210
and far more comfortable than I am in this ridiculous getup.

962
01:17:56,210 --> 01:17:59,460
Oh, don't be silly, darling. You look divine.

963
01:18:00,370 --> 01:18:02,700
- Maxim, I... - This whole idea was a mistake.

964
01:18:02,700 --> 01:18:04,870
I should never have brought you back here.

965
01:19:02,990 --> 01:19:07,730
There are sailors and soldiers returned from the war.

966
01:19:07,730 --> 01:19:09,910
This ain't no place for you, miss.

967
01:19:09,910 --> 01:19:14,910
Who bravely have fought in their country's cause.

968
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:17,910
To come home, to be starved,

969
01:19:17,910 --> 01:19:20,990
best stayed where they was...

970
01:20:03,990 --> 01:20:07,710
Rebecca! Rebecca! Rebecca! Rebecca!

971
01:20:07,710 --> 01:20:11,690
Rebecca! Rebecca! Rebecca! Rebecca!

972
01:20:11,700 --> 01:20:15,680
Rebecca! Rebecca! Rebecca! Rebecca!

973
01:20:15,680 --> 01:20:17,990
Rebecca! Rebecca!

974
01:20:39,350 --> 01:20:40,780
Maxim?

975
01:20:59,650 --> 01:21:01,100
There, do you see now?

976
01:21:03,540 --> 01:21:04,950
You'll never replace her.

977
01:21:04,950 --> 01:21:07,380
- You can't replace her. - You did this.

978
01:21:09,090 --> 01:21:12,490
- You've been against me from the start. - No.

979
01:21:12,490 --> 01:21:16,190
- I was helping you. - You tricked me. You planned this.

980
01:21:16,190 --> 01:21:19,330
You and I both know you are nothing.

981
01:21:19,330 --> 01:21:21,440
You're worthless.

982
01:21:21,440 --> 01:21:25,380
Not worthy of him and not worthy of this house.

983
01:21:25,790 --> 01:21:27,600
He'll never love you.

984
01:21:28,550 --> 01:21:30,040
And why should he?

985
01:21:31,440 --> 01:21:32,340
He did.

986
01:21:32,340 --> 01:21:35,940
No, he can't love you because you're not her.

987
01:21:37,020 --> 01:21:38,330
You should've seen her.

988
01:21:38,340 --> 01:21:42,670
At 16 years old, on her father's horse, a huge brute,

989
01:21:42,670 --> 01:21:44,990
but she mastered him.

990
01:21:45,040 --> 01:21:47,230
By the time she finished with him,

991
01:21:47,230 --> 01:21:50,300
he was nothing but froth and blood.

992
01:21:51,780 --> 01:21:54,890
I've let her down, allowing you here for so long.

993
01:21:55,870 --> 01:21:57,540
She won't stand for it.

994
01:21:57,540 --> 01:21:59,970
"I'll see you in hell, Danny! I'll see you in hell first!"

995
01:21:59,970 --> 01:22:03,750
But Rebecca's dead! She's dead!

996
01:22:03,800 --> 01:22:05,680
He'll leave you, he'll divorce you.

997
01:22:06,350 --> 01:22:07,860
And then what'll you do?

998
01:22:08,150 --> 01:22:09,330
I'll just go.

999
01:22:09,600 --> 01:22:12,570
You'll go? Go where?

1000
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:15,190
You can't remarry now.

1001
01:22:15,560 --> 01:22:18,030
You certainly can't look after a house.

1002
01:22:18,400 --> 01:22:21,150
You don't have any family to support you.

1003
01:22:26,380 --> 01:22:27,810
It's all right.

1004
01:22:28,690 --> 01:22:32,090
I know how you feel. It's not as bad as all that.

1005
01:22:33,560 --> 01:22:35,150
It'll be very quick.

1006
01:22:36,480 --> 01:22:40,720
Don't be scared. It's all for the best.

1007
01:22:42,020 --> 01:22:44,390
No one wants you here.

1008
01:22:49,180 --> 01:22:51,240
Frith! Robert! Come quickly.

1009
01:22:51,270 --> 01:22:53,420
A trawler's run aground. Get the coast guard.

1010
01:22:53,420 --> 01:22:55,620
- They're on the way, sir. - Maxim.

1011
01:23:18,660 --> 01:23:21,090
What's he doin' down there?

1012
01:23:25,210 --> 01:23:26,950
Daniel, wait for me.

1013
01:23:28,340 --> 01:23:31,900
Move on, now. Get up, now. That's it.

1014
01:23:31,900 --> 01:23:33,690
Stand back! Coming forward!

1015
01:23:33,700 --> 01:23:35,050
Diver's down there.

1016
01:23:35,560 --> 01:23:37,550
Must've been something valuable.

1017
01:23:37,570 --> 01:23:38,940
That's for the trawler.

1018
01:23:39,130 --> 01:23:41,180
They found somethin' else down there.

1019
01:23:45,580 --> 01:23:48,610
That's it! Good lad!

1022
01:24:13,670 --> 01:24:16,380
I never said nothing. Did I?

1023
01:24:17,310 --> 01:24:19,100
She'll not come back now.

1024
01:24:19,100 --> 01:24:22,110
The fishes will have devoured her by now, ain't they?

1025
01:24:23,690 --> 01:24:24,870
Frank.

1026
01:24:26,700 --> 01:24:28,340
You really shouldn't be here.

1027
01:24:36,690 --> 01:24:39,960
Don't wait there. Come on. Everybody move. Stand back.

1028
01:24:48,400 --> 01:24:52,190
The body was found in her boat. The same color hair.

1029
01:24:52,930 --> 01:24:54,730
And the engravings on her wedding ring.

1030
01:24:54,740 --> 01:24:56,420
There's no doubt it's her.

1031
01:24:56,420 --> 01:24:58,460
Don't be an imbecile.

1032
01:24:58,960 --> 01:25:02,060
I'm sure there's a perfectly logical explanation, hmm?

1033
01:25:02,060 --> 01:25:03,780
You don't think it's odd?

1034
01:25:03,860 --> 01:25:04,900
That your brother identified

1035
01:25:04,900 --> 01:25:07,040
and buried the body of a stranger as his wife?

1036
01:25:07,040 --> 01:25:09,260
No, Giles, I don't.

1037
01:25:09,330 --> 01:25:12,330
If you're so concerned, why don't you go and ask Maxim yourself.

1038
01:25:12,330 --> 01:25:15,980
I would, but no one's seen him for hours. I mean...

1039
01:25:17,010 --> 01:25:20,580
What's happened? Why were the police questioning him?

1040
01:25:22,940 --> 01:25:26,760
No. He's not been home. Why? When did they release him?

1041
01:25:27,440 --> 01:25:29,420
...please, do let me know when you see him.

1042
01:25:29,420 --> 01:25:33,660
Yes, of course, Frank. Thank you.

1043
01:25:33,680 --> 01:25:35,970
Don't worry. Take care of yourself.

1044
01:26:24,890 --> 01:26:27,400
It's over. She's won.

1045
01:26:29,310 --> 01:26:30,530
Who's won?

1046
01:26:32,680 --> 01:26:33,920
Rebecca.

1047
01:26:38,540 --> 01:26:40,780
If that's her body they found,

1048
01:26:41,600 --> 01:26:43,270
who is it you buried?

1049
01:26:44,450 --> 01:26:45,590
I don't know.

1050
01:26:46,200 --> 01:26:47,480
Maxim.

1051
01:26:49,600 --> 01:26:50,910
The truth.

1052
01:26:51,950 --> 01:26:54,760
I don't know. I swear it.

1053
01:26:56,930 --> 01:26:58,370
How did she drown?

1054
01:26:59,340 --> 01:27:00,510
She didn't.

1055
01:27:01,240 --> 01:27:02,510
Don't lie to me.

1056
01:27:03,160 --> 01:27:05,010
She didn't drown.

1057
01:27:05,970 --> 01:27:07,650
She was already dead.

1058
01:27:08,450 --> 01:27:10,240
Her boat was damaged.

1059
01:27:10,870 --> 01:27:12,360
I damaged it.

1060
01:27:13,880 --> 01:27:15,310
Deliberately.

1061
01:27:18,980 --> 01:27:20,400
Oh, Maxim.

1062
01:27:21,180 --> 01:27:22,720
You didn't know her.

1063
01:27:23,630 --> 01:27:25,120
Nobody did.

1064
01:27:28,120 --> 01:27:30,740
She told me on our honeymoon how it would be.

1065
01:27:31,060 --> 01:27:33,640
How she would keep her flat in London.

1066
01:27:34,010 --> 01:27:37,690
Her parade of men. Even her own cousin.

1067
01:27:38,280 --> 01:27:39,720
Please, Maxim!

1068
01:27:40,720 --> 01:27:44,180
She relished it. Playing the part.

1069
01:27:44,180 --> 01:27:48,370
The perfect wife, knowing that I would never divorce her.

1070
01:27:48,370 --> 01:27:49,840
'Cause you loved her.

1071
01:27:52,850 --> 01:27:55,480
I hated her.

1072
01:27:57,990 --> 01:27:59,880
Hated her cruelty.

1073
01:28:01,260 --> 01:28:03,410
I hated my cowardice.

1074
01:28:04,470 --> 01:28:06,510
Knowing that I wouldn't divorce her.

1075
01:28:07,230 --> 01:28:09,650
Knowing I could never do that to our name.

1076
01:28:16,620 --> 01:28:18,260
How did she die?

1077
01:28:18,540 --> 01:28:19,820
When she came back from London,

1078
01:28:19,820 --> 01:28:23,140
she told me she was expecting a visit from Favell.

1079
01:28:23,900 --> 01:28:25,580
When I got here, she was alone.

1080
01:28:25,630 --> 01:28:27,700
She looked different. She was pale.

1081
01:28:28,630 --> 01:28:30,500
She'd seen a doctor in London.

1082
01:28:30,640 --> 01:28:33,670
She said, "Imagine if I had a child, Max.

1083
01:28:33,670 --> 01:28:36,520
You could never prove it wasn't yours."

1084
01:28:36,520 --> 01:28:39,620
See, it wasn't enough for her to take my pride.

1085
01:28:40,330 --> 01:28:44,260
She wanted to take my name, my home, everything.

1086
01:28:44,990 --> 01:28:48,860
And she said, "Go on, Max, do it."

1087
01:28:49,310 --> 01:28:52,190
"All you have to do is pull the trigger and you'll be free."

1088
01:28:54,650 --> 01:28:55,870
Please.

1089
01:29:19,390 --> 01:29:20,960
Bullet went straight through her.

1090
01:29:21,890 --> 01:29:24,500
She didn't fall right away. She just stood there.

1091
01:29:24,920 --> 01:29:26,660
So calm.

1092
01:29:27,760 --> 01:29:29,410
Almost relieved.

1093
01:29:32,350 --> 01:29:33,810
And then she was gone.

1094
01:29:37,060 --> 01:29:39,840
All this time I thought you still loved Rebecca.

1095
01:30:04,920 --> 01:30:06,480
Why didn't you tell me?

1096
01:30:14,020 --> 01:30:15,300
I couldn't.

1097
01:30:18,290 --> 01:30:20,890
I was so afraid I'd have lost you.

1098
01:30:23,820 --> 01:30:26,190
Go to the police, tell them everything.

1099
01:30:26,740 --> 01:30:30,780
You didn't know. Nothing'll happen to you.

1100
01:30:34,030 --> 01:30:36,590
I understand if you want nothing more to do with me.

1101
01:30:38,220 --> 01:30:39,510
That's your choice.

1102
01:30:43,200 --> 01:30:45,040
You made a mistake...

1103
01:30:46,680 --> 01:30:48,600
identifying the body.

1104
01:30:49,120 --> 01:30:51,330
It was the grief, the trauma.

1105
01:30:52,690 --> 01:30:55,240
Nobody knows but us. Nobody will ever know.

1106
01:30:57,770 --> 01:30:59,830
No, she hasn't won, Maxim.

1107
01:31:00,110 --> 01:31:01,440
She hasn't won.

1108
01:31:02,080 --> 01:31:03,520
We won't let her.

1109
01:31:25,030 --> 01:31:26,510
You don't have to speak to them.

1110
01:31:26,510 --> 01:31:29,580
All stand for the Right Honorable James Crouch.

1111
01:31:34,270 --> 01:31:34,790
Stand back.

1112
01:31:34,790 --> 01:31:37,680
Order! Settle down.

1113
01:31:37,780 --> 01:31:39,960
This is the... Sit down, sir.

1114
01:31:39,960 --> 01:31:41,870
This is the coroner's inquest

1115
01:31:41,880 --> 01:31:45,240
into the discovery of the body of Rebecca de Winter.

1116
01:31:45,610 --> 01:31:48,170
This is not currently a criminal proceeding.

1117
01:31:48,170 --> 01:31:52,090
We are here only to ascertain how Mrs. de Winter died.

1118
01:31:52,090 --> 01:31:53,340
The court will now hear

1119
01:31:53,340 --> 01:31:56,330
from Detective Welch of the Kerrith police.

1120
01:31:56,480 --> 01:31:57,950
Detective Welch.

1121
01:31:59,650 --> 01:32:03,420
The body Mr. de Winter identified last year...

1122
01:32:04,140 --> 01:32:05,760
was not his wife.

1123
01:32:06,070 --> 01:32:08,600
In fact, Rebecca de Winter's body

1124
01:32:08,600 --> 01:32:11,590
was recovered from the cabin of her boat.

1125
01:32:11,870 --> 01:32:13,340
That troubled me.

1126
01:32:13,380 --> 01:32:15,550
As did the nature of the damage to the vessel.

1127
01:32:15,550 --> 01:32:17,510
And what was that nature?

1128
01:32:17,600 --> 01:32:19,770
We found four holes below the waterline

1129
01:32:19,770 --> 01:32:22,810
consistent with those made by a ship's gaff.

1130
01:32:23,490 --> 01:32:25,640
- Or spike. - Suggesting what?

1131
01:32:25,640 --> 01:32:28,080
That the boat was deliberately scuttled.

1132
01:32:28,940 --> 01:32:31,100
In my opinion, Mr. Coroner,

1133
01:32:31,120 --> 01:32:34,970
this inquest can return one of only two verdicts.

1134
01:32:35,350 --> 01:32:39,120
Suicide or unlawful killing.

1135
01:32:44,990 --> 01:32:47,910
Your wife made a trip to London the day she died.

1136
01:32:48,300 --> 01:32:49,400
It's time.

1137
01:32:49,400 --> 01:32:52,980
In your statement to the police, you say your wife seemed

1138
01:32:52,980 --> 01:32:56,520
"Preoccupied and unhappy" when she returned.

1139
01:32:56,720 --> 01:32:59,420
Don't be defensive. Answer their questions calmly.

1140
01:33:00,630 --> 01:33:02,640
What was the purpose of her trip?

1141
01:33:03,220 --> 01:33:04,100
No idea.

1142
01:33:04,260 --> 01:33:05,970
Was it normal for your wife

1143
01:33:05,970 --> 01:33:08,680
not to discuss such matters with her husband?

1144
01:33:08,680 --> 01:33:11,140
Are you implying there were problems in my marriage?

1145
01:33:11,340 --> 01:33:14,130
I'm trying to understand how you apparently failed

1146
01:33:14,130 --> 01:33:16,470
to recognize your own wife last year.

1147
01:33:16,470 --> 01:33:18,010
She'd been two months at sea.

1148
01:33:18,010 --> 01:33:19,300
She drifted 20 miles.

1149
01:33:19,300 --> 01:33:20,680
She was bloated, decomposing,

1150
01:33:20,680 --> 01:33:24,220
her arms ripped off, ` and there was nothing left of her face.

1151
01:33:24,760 --> 01:33:27,680
Order! Order!

1152
01:33:32,470 --> 01:33:35,050
I was arrogant and stupid.

1153
01:33:35,880 --> 01:33:38,800
- I lost my nerve. - No, you were passionate.

1154
01:33:39,220 --> 01:33:40,390
They'll believe it.

1155
01:33:41,340 --> 01:33:43,680
Who else knows she saw a doctor in London?

1156
01:33:47,260 --> 01:33:48,680
You, me, and the doctor.

1157
01:33:49,590 --> 01:33:52,340
They're not likely to find any physical evidence.

1158
01:33:53,010 --> 01:33:54,800
Not after so long at sea.

1159
01:33:57,340 --> 01:33:58,800
The doctor is all they have.

1160
01:34:05,260 --> 01:34:09,010
I did tell Mr. Favell he wasn't welcome, but he insisted.

1161
01:34:09,260 --> 01:34:10,840
Thank you, Mrs. Danvers.

1162
01:34:13,130 --> 01:34:14,840
What the hell do you want?

1163
01:34:18,380 --> 01:34:20,180
Another whiskey and soda would be nice.

1164
01:34:21,970 --> 01:34:23,220
It's about Rebecca,

1165
01:34:23,220 --> 01:34:25,340
so you might want to send your wife off to bed.

1166
01:34:25,340 --> 01:34:26,680
I'm not going anywhere.

1167
01:34:26,760 --> 01:34:28,640
I know all about you and Rebecca.

1168
01:34:29,130 --> 01:34:30,010
Really?

1169
01:34:30,930 --> 01:34:32,760
You know all about that, do you?

1170
01:34:34,220 --> 01:34:35,970
You were close, Favell.

1171
01:34:36,380 --> 01:34:38,050
If I'd caught you here that night with her...

1172
01:34:38,050 --> 01:34:39,350
He was never here that night.

1173
01:34:39,350 --> 01:34:40,930
But she did invite me.

1174
01:34:42,430 --> 01:34:43,470
And that's the point.

1175
01:34:44,510 --> 01:34:46,930
Suicide or foul play,

1176
01:34:47,130 --> 01:34:48,930
that's what the chap said, wasn't it?

1177
01:34:50,380 --> 01:34:53,220
Now, inviting someone over...

1178
01:34:53,390 --> 01:34:55,590
doesn't really sound like the sort of thing one would do

1179
01:34:55,590 --> 01:34:58,970
if one was planning to end it all, does it?

1180
01:35:00,010 --> 01:35:03,720
And that's what's been driving me mad this last year.

1181
01:35:04,800 --> 01:35:06,640
But it's beginning to make sense.

1182
01:35:08,380 --> 01:35:10,930
She finally decided to leave you.

1183
01:35:11,260 --> 01:35:12,680
Is that why you killed her?

1184
01:35:13,930 --> 01:35:15,180
You've no proof.

1185
01:35:15,760 --> 01:35:17,640
It's your word against mine.

1186
01:35:17,760 --> 01:35:18,680
No.

1187
01:35:21,130 --> 01:35:23,470
It's your word against Rebecca's.

1188
01:35:25,800 --> 01:35:27,970
"Come to Manders when you get this.

1189
01:35:28,220 --> 01:35:29,800
I've something to tell you

1190
01:35:29,930 --> 01:35:34,340
and I want to see you as soon as possible. Rebecca."

1191
01:35:35,220 --> 01:35:35,970
Let me see.

1192
01:35:37,430 --> 01:35:39,720
- Get out of my house. - Don't rise to it, Maxim.

1193
01:35:39,720 --> 01:35:42,010
Yes. Don't rise to it, Max.

1194
01:35:43,590 --> 01:35:45,800
I only came by to thank you, really.

1195
01:35:46,380 --> 01:35:49,420
You've been so generous over the years,

1196
01:35:49,420 --> 01:35:52,630
sharing your wife with so many of us chaps.

1197
01:35:53,550 --> 01:35:56,840
Actually, I wondered if I might try my luck with the new one.

1198
01:35:59,550 --> 01:36:02,300
There it is. There's that temper I told you about.

1199
01:36:02,550 --> 01:36:04,340
How much do you want?

1200
01:36:06,470 --> 01:36:08,720
She's cleverer than she looks, this one, isn't she?

1201
01:36:11,090 --> 01:36:12,390
Seems to be a spot of blood.

1202
01:36:13,630 --> 01:36:14,760
Dearie me.

1203
01:36:21,140 --> 01:36:22,300
She's right, though.

1204
01:36:23,840 --> 01:36:25,760
I'm not a rich man, Max.

1205
01:36:27,380 --> 01:36:28,960
Well, I'm too fond of gambling for that,

1206
01:36:28,970 --> 01:36:33,720
but I do have a certain lifestyle that I've come to enjoy.

1207
01:36:35,970 --> 01:36:38,260
I imagine I could get by on around...

1208
01:36:39,760 --> 01:36:42,590
£10,000 for the note

1209
01:36:42,800 --> 01:36:45,630
and my silence when I take the stand tomorrow.

1210
01:36:45,630 --> 01:36:47,390
This is blackmail.

1211
01:36:47,470 --> 01:36:50,090
- What are you doing? - Calling the police.

1212
01:36:50,800 --> 01:36:52,260
Yeah. Call the police.

1213
01:36:54,590 --> 01:36:56,510
Might even put us in the same cell.

1214
01:36:57,760 --> 01:36:58,800
Not for long, though.

1215
01:36:59,510 --> 01:37:02,510
I imagine you're looking at the noose, Maxim.

1216
01:37:09,590 --> 01:37:11,590
At Inspector Welch's request,

1217
01:37:11,590 --> 01:37:14,720
there's a change to this morning's proceedings.

1218
01:37:14,720 --> 01:37:16,090
We shall now hear

1219
01:37:16,090 --> 01:37:19,840
from the de Winters' housekeeper, Mrs. Danvers.

1220
01:37:27,050 --> 01:37:29,180
Safe to say not much occurs at Manderley

1221
01:37:29,180 --> 01:37:32,010
without your knowledge or say-so, would I be right?

1222
01:37:32,010 --> 01:37:35,470
I ensure the smooth running of the house.

1223
01:37:35,470 --> 01:37:36,970
Which is how you came to be aware

1224
01:37:36,970 --> 01:37:40,720
of the late Mrs. de Winter's relationship with Mr. Favell.

1225
01:37:41,180 --> 01:37:43,840
Well, I was aware they were, intimate.

1226
01:37:43,840 --> 01:37:45,800
But my lady's private affairs were her own.

1227
01:37:45,800 --> 01:37:46,850
So they should be.

1228
01:37:46,970 --> 01:37:49,630
But since these circumstances are far from normal,

1229
01:37:49,630 --> 01:37:53,390
perhaps you'd share with the court what you told me last night.

1230
01:37:53,760 --> 01:37:56,850
I learned of a note addressed to Mr. Favell.

1231
01:37:57,260 --> 01:38:00,050
I urged him to share that note with you.

1232
01:38:00,470 --> 01:38:04,220
A note Mr. de Winter seemed keen to keep from this court.

1233
01:38:04,220 --> 01:38:05,050
Yes.

1234
01:38:05,970 --> 01:38:08,050
The note was inviting Mr. Favell

1235
01:38:08,050 --> 01:38:11,390
to join Mrs. de Winter at the house...

1236
01:38:12,090 --> 01:38:13,970
the night my lady died.

1237
01:38:14,590 --> 01:38:19,730
Mr. de Winter offered money in exchange for that note.

1238
01:38:19,730 --> 01:38:21,630
The note was from Rebecca de Winter.

1239
01:38:21,630 --> 01:38:22,680
It was.

1240
01:38:23,260 --> 01:38:26,680
She wrote she had urgent news to share with him.

1241
01:38:27,430 --> 01:38:32,840
And how much was Mr. Favell offered?

1242
01:38:33,010 --> 01:38:34,760
£10,000.

1243
01:38:40,430 --> 01:38:41,220
A check...

1244
01:38:42,890 --> 01:38:45,050
written by Mr. de Winter...

1245
01:38:45,550 --> 01:38:47,920
in exchange for the note.

1246
01:38:47,930 --> 01:38:49,470
Where does it say that? All you have is a check.

1247
01:38:49,470 --> 01:38:52,590
- Nothing to say what it's for. - Order! Madam, order.

1248
01:38:53,050 --> 01:38:56,220
Mrs. Danvers, do you think it's likely

1249
01:38:56,220 --> 01:38:59,300
Rebecca de Winter drowned herself?

1250
01:38:59,430 --> 01:39:01,340
No, sir. I do not.

1251
01:39:01,380 --> 01:39:04,260
In the weeks, leading up to her death,

1252
01:39:04,260 --> 01:39:07,180
she had become fatigued

1253
01:39:07,180 --> 01:39:10,510
and was feeling sick.

1254
01:39:10,840 --> 01:39:14,800
And she asked me to let out the waistband in her trousers.

1255
01:39:14,800 --> 01:39:17,840
Her belly was growing.

1256
01:39:22,260 --> 01:39:24,300
Mrs. de Winter went to London the day she died.

1257
01:39:24,300 --> 01:39:25,470
Did she say why?

1258
01:39:25,510 --> 01:39:26,630
- No. - Odd.

1259
01:39:26,630 --> 01:39:28,340
It must've been something deeply personal

1260
01:39:28,340 --> 01:39:29,930
for her to have kept that from me.

1261
01:39:29,930 --> 01:39:32,510
Like, say, an appointment with her doctor.

1262
01:39:32,510 --> 01:39:34,510
Not her family doctor, as you might expect,

1263
01:39:34,510 --> 01:39:35,930
but someone discreet.

1264
01:39:37,090 --> 01:39:38,430
Away from prying eyes

1265
01:39:38,430 --> 01:39:39,760
as if news of her condition

1266
01:39:39,760 --> 01:39:42,220
was something she wished to keep private.

1267
01:39:42,380 --> 01:39:46,050
A wish to share only with her lover,

1268
01:39:46,380 --> 01:39:47,760
Jack Favell.

1269
01:39:48,380 --> 01:39:51,880
You murdering bastard. You're a murdering bastard!

1270
01:39:51,880 --> 01:39:54,930
With my child! I hope they hang you.

1271
01:39:55,260 --> 01:39:57,470
I hope they hang you! You murdered Rebecca!

1272
01:39:57,470 --> 01:39:59,140
Only two possible verdicts.

1273
01:39:59,140 --> 01:40:03,340
I hope you agree, sir, that there's no motive at all for suicide.

1274
01:40:03,340 --> 01:40:05,670
But a clear one for murder.

1275
01:40:05,670 --> 01:40:10,010
This inquest is suspended pending a criminal investigation.

1276
01:40:10,010 --> 01:40:12,930
Ladies and gentlemen, court is adjourned.

1277
01:40:13,550 --> 01:40:15,470
Nobody's above the law.

1278
01:40:16,140 --> 01:40:18,720
Get your hands off me! Get off!

1279
01:40:18,800 --> 01:40:20,010
Mrs. Danvers.

1280
01:40:20,510 --> 01:40:22,260
Say nothing. They can't prove anything.

1281
01:40:22,260 --> 01:40:24,340
I want her appointment books, diaries, address books,

1282
01:40:24,340 --> 01:40:26,260
household finances, everything.

1283
01:40:26,260 --> 01:40:29,510
She saw that doctor sometime and she paid him.

1284
01:40:30,340 --> 01:40:33,590
Roe, start placing calls to women specialists in London.

1285
01:41:03,930 --> 01:41:05,430
No. No.

1286
01:41:12,930 --> 01:41:15,760
I'm sorry, do you have permission to search this place?

1288
01:41:35,010 --> 01:41:36,050
Mrs. de Winter?

1289
01:41:36,590 --> 01:41:37,670
- Frank! - What?

1290
01:41:37,680 --> 01:41:39,760
I need her checks, her bank statements.

1291
01:41:39,760 --> 01:41:42,220
Anything that has the name and address of her doctor.

1292
01:41:42,220 --> 01:41:43,460
Right. Here it is.

1293
01:41:43,470 --> 01:41:44,970
I know what you need.

1294
01:41:48,510 --> 01:41:50,470
- I need a doctor. - You need her doctor? There.

1296
01:41:52,300 --> 01:41:53,260
That must be it.

1297
01:41:55,590 --> 01:41:56,800
Shame on you.

1298
01:41:57,590 --> 01:41:59,720
Shame on you for taking his side.

1299
01:41:59,720 --> 01:42:02,090
I'm not taking anyone's side, Mrs. Danvers. I...

1300
01:42:02,090 --> 01:42:04,010
And you, Frank.

1301
01:42:04,300 --> 01:42:07,050
Licking Mr. de Winter's boots by day,

1302
01:42:07,050 --> 01:42:10,090
and pawing at the cottage door at night.

1303
01:42:10,090 --> 01:42:12,430
Sobbing like a schoolboy.

1304
01:42:13,340 --> 01:42:15,680
She despised you all.

1305
01:42:16,340 --> 01:42:19,720
The men in London, the men at the Manderley parties.

1306
01:42:19,720 --> 01:42:22,890
You were nothing but playthings for her.

1307
01:42:23,640 --> 01:42:27,180
And why shouldn't a woman amuse herself?

1308
01:42:30,470 --> 01:42:35,260
She lived her life as she pleased, my Rebecca.

1309
01:42:38,380 --> 01:42:40,720
No wonder a man had to kill her.

1310
01:42:43,010 --> 01:42:44,640
It must have hurt.

1311
01:42:45,930 --> 01:42:47,380
Knowing your only friend in the world

1312
01:42:47,380 --> 01:42:49,800
took a secret like that to her grave.

1313
01:42:53,050 --> 01:42:55,180
Pack your bags, Mrs. Danvers.

1314
01:42:55,970 --> 01:42:57,840
I expect you gone by nightfall.

1316
01:44:45,180 --> 01:44:46,670
- Miss? - Terribly sorry,

1317
01:44:46,680 --> 01:44:48,220
I've left my purse.

1318
01:44:48,380 --> 01:44:50,430
Who was it you saw, Miss?

1319
01:44:50,470 --> 01:44:52,010
Dr. John Baker.

1320
01:44:58,340 --> 01:44:59,300
Thank you.

1321
01:45:05,970 --> 01:45:06,970
Wait there.

1322
01:45:16,760 --> 01:45:19,220
- Dr. Baker, sir. - Good evening, Tas.

1323
01:45:23,800 --> 01:45:24,890
"Danvers."

1324
01:45:36,930 --> 01:45:39,510
I see so many patients.

1325
01:45:42,220 --> 01:45:43,470
I can't remember her.

1326
01:45:43,840 --> 01:45:47,340
Maybe it'll come back when you see her file.

1327
01:45:51,130 --> 01:45:52,680
It would have been more convenient

1328
01:45:52,680 --> 01:45:54,590
to read the file to begin with.

1329
01:45:57,090 --> 01:45:59,220
We'll do what we can to help.

1330
01:45:59,520 --> 01:46:02,730
Oh, no. This is not as it should be.

1331
01:46:04,270 --> 01:46:05,650
Where's she gone now?

1332
01:46:06,150 --> 01:46:06,940
Who?

1334
01:46:08,980 --> 01:46:10,570
The young woman who was here.

1335
01:46:13,940 --> 01:46:14,900
It's not here.

1336
01:46:15,760 --> 01:46:17,840
I'll have a word with my secretary.

1338
01:46:21,020 --> 01:46:23,170
It's possible she misplaced it.

1339
01:46:23,650 --> 01:46:28,360
This girl. Is there any way she could get out of here?

1341
01:46:58,600 --> 01:46:59,860
I read it, that's all.

1342
01:46:59,860 --> 01:47:01,670
I haven't changed a word Dr. Baker wrote.

1343
01:47:01,670 --> 01:47:02,860
Rebecca Danvers.

1344
01:47:02,860 --> 01:47:05,560
Yes, now I remember. Terrible thing.

1345
01:47:05,560 --> 01:47:06,820
That wasn't her real name.

1346
01:47:07,270 --> 01:47:08,600
And she wasn't pregnant.

1347
01:47:08,610 --> 01:47:10,440
Then why would she use a false name?

1348
01:47:10,440 --> 01:47:12,770
Why would she come all the way to London

1349
01:47:12,770 --> 01:47:14,060
to make an appointment with you

1350
01:47:14,070 --> 01:47:15,730
and not her family doctor?

1351
01:47:15,730 --> 01:47:18,190
Perhaps she wanted to spare her family the news.

1352
01:47:18,190 --> 01:47:20,320
That the baby wasn't her husband's?

1353
01:47:20,520 --> 01:47:24,560
Inspector, I am not that kind of women's specialist.

1354
01:47:24,560 --> 01:47:26,190
I'm not an obstetrician.

1355
01:47:26,270 --> 01:47:28,860
My field is oncology.

1356
01:47:28,900 --> 01:47:32,190
I treat cancers of the reproductive system.

1357
01:47:32,190 --> 01:47:33,440
The bloating, the fatigue.

1358
01:47:33,440 --> 01:47:34,900
They're common symptoms.

1359
01:47:36,190 --> 01:47:37,520
She had cancer.

1360
01:47:39,900 --> 01:47:41,610
There's her news for Jack Favell.

1361
01:47:41,690 --> 01:47:43,980
That doesn't prove she killed herself.

1362
01:47:44,060 --> 01:47:46,150
She wouldn't have wanted to suffer.

1363
01:47:46,310 --> 01:47:48,980
Yes, she told me as much.

1364
01:47:49,190 --> 01:47:52,150
She was very advanced by the time she was symptomatic.

1365
01:47:52,150 --> 01:47:53,310
Saw her first in April,

1366
01:47:53,310 --> 01:47:56,650
by May, it was clear she was too far gone for treatment.

1367
01:47:56,860 --> 01:47:57,940
She only had weeks

1368
01:47:57,940 --> 01:48:01,130
and the pain would have been considerable.

1369
01:48:02,190 --> 01:48:03,270
How did she do it?

1370
01:48:05,650 --> 01:48:08,270
She took out her boat and scuttled it.

1371
01:48:09,440 --> 01:48:11,190
She drowned herself.

1372
01:48:53,550 --> 01:48:55,550
Stroke of luck for you there, Max.

1373
01:49:04,970 --> 01:49:06,760
I bet you think you've won, don't you?

1374
01:49:08,560 --> 01:49:10,400
Well, maybe the law can't get you.

1375
01:49:10,610 --> 01:49:11,600
I still can.

1376
01:49:13,020 --> 01:49:14,690
Is there anything else you want to say?

1377
01:49:16,400 --> 01:49:17,940
If there is, you better say it now.

1378
01:49:31,810 --> 01:49:33,730
Do you know what I hate her for most?

1379
01:49:35,520 --> 01:49:37,230
It's what she's taken from you.

1380
01:49:38,440 --> 01:49:39,300
It's gone forever.

1381
01:49:39,300 --> 01:49:43,430
That funny, young, lost look I loved so much.

1382
01:49:44,630 --> 01:49:46,260
You're not that person anymore.

1383
01:49:46,920 --> 01:49:48,630
Don't hate her for that.

1385
01:50:33,020 --> 01:50:34,110
What's that burning?

1386
01:50:34,730 --> 01:50:36,270
Oh, my God, that's Manderley.

1387
01:50:44,730 --> 01:50:46,690
Come on! Get away from there.

1388
01:50:46,730 --> 01:50:48,570
Get off the lawn! Go! Come on!

1389
01:50:51,150 --> 01:50:53,270
Get off the lawn! Frith, get off the lawn!

1390
01:50:53,440 --> 01:50:54,980
How many people are inside? Is everyone out?

1391
01:50:54,980 --> 01:50:55,980
I don't know, sir.

1392
01:50:56,050 --> 01:50:58,260
You all right? What happened, Clarice?

1393
01:50:58,970 --> 01:50:59,770
I saw her.

1394
01:50:59,770 --> 01:51:01,190
What do you mean? Who did you see?

1395
01:51:01,190 --> 01:51:02,900
Mrs. Danvers.

1396
01:51:02,940 --> 01:51:04,320
Help her! Help her!

1397
01:51:05,270 --> 01:51:06,490
Where are the hoses?

1398
01:51:06,520 --> 01:51:08,690
Where is she? Where is she!

1399
01:51:08,810 --> 01:51:10,730
She went to the boat house.

1400
01:52:18,940 --> 01:52:21,630
Mrs. Danvers! Please!

1401
01:52:22,400 --> 01:52:23,650
Please come away.

1402
01:52:25,150 --> 01:52:27,480
You asked for my help. Here it is.

1403
01:52:28,110 --> 01:52:29,770
Mrs. Danvers, please.

1404
01:52:30,730 --> 01:52:33,400
He killed the only person I loved.

1405
01:52:34,440 --> 01:52:36,480
I can't let you have Manderley.

1406
01:52:37,650 --> 01:52:39,440
It was ours, you see.

1407
01:52:40,810 --> 01:52:42,360
You don't have to do this.

1408
01:52:42,360 --> 01:52:44,570
I know you'll stand by him.

1409
01:52:45,190 --> 01:52:47,150
But you'll never know happiness.

1410
01:52:50,320 --> 01:52:51,450
Yes, I will.

1411
01:53:53,230 --> 01:53:56,020
Last night, I dreamt I went to Manderley again.

1412
01:53:58,520 --> 01:54:01,570
I dreamt of Mrs. Danvers and of Rebecca.

1413
01:54:05,900 --> 01:54:07,820
But this morning I woke up

1414
01:54:08,760 --> 01:54:10,720
and left the dead behind.

1415
01:54:12,860 --> 01:54:14,560
And as I sit before the mirror

1416
01:54:14,560 --> 01:54:17,440
in our stuffy little room in Cairo,

1417
01:54:18,520 --> 01:54:22,400
just another stop on our quest to find a real home,

1418
01:54:24,310 --> 01:54:26,440
I can see the woman I am now.

1419
01:54:28,570 --> 01:54:31,300
And I know that I have made the right decision...

1420
01:54:34,260 --> 01:54:38,010
to save the one thing worth walking through flames for.

1421
01:54:40,760 --> 01:54:41,630
Love.
