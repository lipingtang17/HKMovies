20
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:53,060
昨晚  我又梦到我去了曼陀丽庄园
Last night, I dreamt I went to Manderley again.

21
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:55,740
我梦到曾经作为车道的地方
I dreamt that where our drive once lay,

22
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:58,110
现在都长成了黑暗又扭曲的丛林
a dark and tortured jungle grew.

23
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:04,490
大自然吞噬了一切  但那栋房子依然矗立着
Nature had come into her own and yet the house still stood.

24
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:06,280
曼陀丽庄园
Manderley.

25
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:09,400
一如既往地隐秘和寂静
Secretive and silent as it had always been.

26
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:11,740
死而复生
Risen from the dead.

27
00:01:16,150 --> 00:01:19,280
跟所有做梦的人一样  我可以穿越记忆的重重迷雾
Like all dreamers, I was allowed to pass through my memory.

28
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:22,030
像一座桥一样跨过漫长的岁月
Spanning the years like a bridge.

29
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:26,150
回到在蒙特卡洛的那个夏天
Back to that summer in Monte Carlo

30
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,610
彼时的我懵懂无知  前景渺茫
when I knew nothing and had no prospects.

31
00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:45,280
你是说8块钱吗
Did you say eight?

32
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,490
8块钱  没错
Huit. Yes.

33
00:01:49,570 --> 00:01:50,040
谢谢  
Merci. 

34
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:51,650
-再见  -再见
- Au revoir. - Au revoir.

35
00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:00,320
我可以清晰地看到当年的那个女孩
I can see the girl I was so clearly,

36
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:02,780
即便我已经认不出她来了
even if I no longer recognize her.

37
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:07,320
我很好奇  
And I wonder 

38
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:10,110
如果没有范·霍珀夫人  我的人生会是怎样的
what my life would have been without Mrs. Van Hopper.

39
00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:13,110
如果没有那份工作
Without that job.

40
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:16,030
想想甚是有趣  我的整个人生经历
Funny to think that the course of my existence

41
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:18,400
像一根线一样悬于她的好奇心上
hung like a thread upon her curiosity.

42
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:22,860
如果不是她  我永远不可能去曼陀丽庄园
If it wasn't for her, I would never have gone to Manderley...

43
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:25,450
也永远不会认识你
and would never have met you.

44
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:27,700
范·霍珀夫人
Mrs. Van Hopper.

45
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:29,900
你怎么耽搁了这么久
What kept you?

46
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:33,780
很抱歉  我不得不在邮局等一个包裹 我...
I'm sorry. I had to wait for a package at the post office. I...

47
00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:35,740
我觉得是您的外甥寄来的
I believe it's from your nephew.

48
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:39,940
大概是他跟那个令人讨厌的女孩的蜜月旅行照吧
Oh, photographs of his honeymoon with that ghastly girl, I imagine.

49
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:40,780
打开吧
Open it.

50
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:43,350
在楼下准备好餐桌享用午餐
Get a table downstairs for lunch. 

51
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:44,820
好的  照旧是1点钟吗
Yes. One o'clock as usual?

52
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:48,320
-就现在  我刚看见迈克西姆·德温特了  -好吧
- Now. I've just seen Maxim de Winter. - Oh, right.

53
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:49,990
看上去  心里的伤痛依然没有抚平
Still heartbroken, by the look of it.

54
00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:51,530
他是您的朋友吗
He's a friend of yours?

55
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:55,200
迈克西姆·德温特  曼陀丽庄园的主人
Maxim de Winter, owner of Manderley.

56
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:58,240
-那是全英国最奢华的住宅之一  -好吧
- One of the finest homes in England. - Oh, yes.

57
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:01,450
他妻子去年去世了  他迫切需要人陪伴
His wife died last year. He's in dire need of company.

58
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:04,190
让酒店领班安排他坐在我旁边
Have the maître d' seat him next to me.

59
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:11,240
你需要给人家小费
You'll have to tip.

60
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:16,900
说真的  我教了你这么多东西
Honestly, with everything I'm teaching you,

61
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:18,280
你应该付钱给我才对
you ought to be paying me.

62
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:20,990
-谢谢你  范·霍珀夫人  -蠢丫头
- Thank you, Mrs. Van Hopper. - Stupid girl.

63
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:30,450
-你好  -小姐
- Bonjour. - Mademoiselle.

64
00:03:31,490 --> 00:03:33,150
还是坐范·霍珀夫人常坐的桌子吗
Madam Van Hopper's usual table?

65
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:34,570
是的  谢谢
Oh, yes, thank you. Merci.

66
00:03:34,570 --> 00:03:35,900
不
Oh, no. 

67
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:37,950
等等  抱歉  她想着
Wait, sorry. She was wondering

68
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:40,110
能不能安排一位姓德温特的先生坐她旁边
if a Mr. de Winter could sit with her.

69
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:42,240
-迈克西姆·德温特先生吗  -是的
- Monsieur Maxim de Winter? - Oui.

70
00:03:42,610 --> 00:03:45,700
德温特先生想坐在哪里  得看他自己的意思
It is the choice of Mr. de Winter where he wishes to be seated.

71
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:47,110
是的  当然了
Oh, yes, of course.

72
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:48,700
谢谢
Merci.

73
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:53,490
抱歉  是不够吗  我这里还有
So sorry. Is that not enough? Um, here. I've got more.

74
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:56,990
天呐  真抱歉  先生
God, I'm so sorry, monsieur.

75
00:03:58,740 --> 00:03:59,490
请稍等一下
Just one moment.

76
00:03:59,490 --> 00:04:02,070
别那么做  我听说他是个非常粗鲁无礼的人
Don't do it. I've heard he's a terrible bore.

77
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:05,320
-什么  -那个姓德温特的家伙
- Excuse me? - This de Winter chap.

78
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:06,150
谢谢
Thank you.

79
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:10,610
德温特先生  这边请
Monsieur de Winter, please, this way.

80
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:26,490
要一打牡蛎
Des huîtres, une douzaine.

81
00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:28,150
要一打牡蛎
"Des huîtres, une douzaine."

82
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:29,940
迈克西姆·德温特
Maxim de Winter.

83
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:34,110
真是出人意料  我都不知道你在蒙特卡洛啊
Well, I never. I had no idea you were in Monte.

84
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:35,990
你务必跟我们同桌用餐
You must join us.

85
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:40,200
我是伊迪·范·霍珀  你应该记得我外甥比尔吧
Edie Van Hopper. I think you remember my nephew. Billy?

86
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:42,930
你去年秋天在布伦海姆见过他  全名是比尔·惠特尼
You met him at Blenheim last fall. Billy Whitney. 

87
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:44,280
他大概跟我差不多高
He's about my height.

88
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:47,280
他的头发是黄色的  眼睛有点弱视
He's got sandy hair and he's got a bit of a lazy eye.

89
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,240
这样的人我怎么可能忘记呢
I can't imagine how I could've forgotten.

90
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,320
请代我向比尔问好
Do give my regards to Billy.

91
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,650
你知道吗
Oh, would you know?

92
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:55,240
他结婚了  对方是一个非常迷人的姑娘
He's married, and to the most enchanting girl.

93
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:56,500
-是吗  真好  -他寄来照片了
- Is he? Good. - He sent photographs.

94
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:57,380
我可以拿给你看
I'm going to show them to you.

95
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:59,540
-过来  婚礼真的非常盛大  -我信你说的  
- Come here. The wedding was divine. - I believe you,

96
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:01,200
但我还是希望独自享用午餐
but I prefer to lunch alone.

97
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:04,070
日安  范·霍珀小姐
Good day, Miss Van Hopper.

98
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:05,070
-不是的  -什么
- Oh, no. - What? 

99
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:08,640
我们没有亲缘关系  她就是个员工
We're not related. She's staff.

100
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:14,280
或许可以称她为我的看护
Well, I mean, I guess you could call her my ward.

101
00:05:15,170 --> 00:05:17,650
好的  明白  失陪了
I see. Now, if you'll excuse me.

102
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:19,110
亲爱的  不如你去把照片拿过来吧
Darling, why don't fetch those photographs?

103
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:21,150
-我相信德温特先生一定很想看看  -好的
- I'm sure Mr. de Winter would love to see them. - Yes.

104
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:23,030
不  真的  拜托  别麻烦了
No, please, please, please. Don't trouble yourself.

105
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:25,190
-没必要拿  -亲爱的  一点都不麻烦
- It's unnecessary. - Oh, my precious, it's no trouble at all!

106
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,660
一点都不麻烦  去吧  快
Not at all. Go along. Quickly. 

107
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,320
没事的  她很快就会下来了
No, no. She'll be down in a jiffy.

108
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:44,490
接下来是我最喜欢的部分
No, this is my favorite part.

109
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:46,740
我叫她去把照片取下来
I asked her to go and get the photographs,

110
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:48,610
她从桌子边飞快地冲出去
and she darts from the table,

111
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:50,490
然后她就走了  半天没回来
and then she's gone. Doesn't come back.

112
00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:53,780
我想着  "天呐  别告诉我她开始画画了"
I thought, "Oh, God, don't tell me she started sketching."

113
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:56,610
-不  她真的是个小画家  -天呐
- Oh, no, no, she's an artist. - Oh, my!

114
00:05:56,610 --> 00:05:59,110
总之  她后来又跑下来了
Anyway, she comes running back down,

115
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:01,780
浑身散发着浓浓的廉价玫瑰水味
reeking of cheap rose water.

116
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:06,740
那气味可真是熏死人
I mean, the smell of it!

117
00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:10,490
只要有一个黄金单身汉
Show me an eligible bachelor

118
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:12,130
就会涌现一屋子
and I will show you a room 

119
00:06:12,130 --> 00:06:16,150
失心疯一般的女人
full of women acting like they've lost their minds.

120
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,130
太迟了
It's too late.

121
00:06:19,530 --> 00:06:21,150
-抱歉  -没事  坐下吧
- Sorry. - Never mind, sit down.

122
00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:24,240
竟说我们有亲缘关系  想想看多离谱
Related. I mean, imagine.

123
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:28,320
我以前很爱曼陀丽庄园的舞会  非常奢华迷人
I loved the Manderley ball. It was just so glamorous.

124
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:30,650
但自从悲剧发生后  就再也没举办过了
I suppose that's all stopped since the tragedy.

125
00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:33,240
竟然发生了那种事  真叫人震惊
Such a shocking thing that happened.

126
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,820
-要如何解释啊  -太可怕了
- How do you explain it? - Awful.

127
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:36,990
他那时深爱着她
He adored her!

128
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,240
他的吕蓓卡
His Rebecca.

129
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:46,360
早上好  范·霍珀夫人
Morning, Mrs. Van Hopper.

130
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,470
范·霍珀夫人
Mrs. Van Hopper?

131
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:54,780
您没事吧
Are you all right?

132
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:57,400
我想吐  我想吐
I'm sick. I'm sick.

133
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:02,030
我  我吐了一晚上了
I'm... I was sick all night.

134
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:05,530
-快  快叫医生来  -好的
- Call the... call the medecin. - Okay.

135
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:09,280
-立刻叫医生过来  -好的
- Call them right now. The doctor. - All right.

136
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:12,780
桶在哪儿  桶在哪儿
Where is the bucket? Where's the bucket?

137
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:15,610
我去拿桶  来  我拿着呢
I'll get the bucket! Here, I've got it.

138
00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:20,690
你在等夫人吗
You are waiting for madame?

139
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:23,740
不  她病了  医生叫她好好休息
Oh, no. She's unwell. The doctor told her to rest.

140
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:25,110
所以今天只有我一个人
So, it's just me today.

141
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:28,570
这是不行的  露台只允许贵客享用
It is not possible. The terrace is for guests only.

142
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:31,350
但我是夫人的同伴
But I'm a lady's companion...

143
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:33,280
当真吗
Really?

144
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,070
是的  员工是不能使用的
Yes, it is not for staff.

145
00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:41,360
先生  这位年轻小姐可以和我坐在一起
Monsieur? The young lady will be joining me. 

146
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:42,740
再安排个座位吧
Set another place, please.

147
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:44,030
当然没问题  德温特先生
Bien sûr, Monsieur de Winter.

148
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:45,990
不  我无法承认这般盛情
No, please. I couldn't possibly.

149
00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:47,360
没事的
It's absolutely fine.

150
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,700
并且如果我们不想聊天  也可以不说话
And we needn't talk unless we feel like it. 

151
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:54,150
你  你不必为我这样的
You... you didn't have to do that.

152
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:56,380
我的动机其实很自私
My motives were entirely selfish.

153
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:59,150
这是昨天的报纸  我都已经看过了
This is yesterday's paper. I've already read it.

154
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,740
谢谢您的好意
Thank you. It's very kind.

155
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:07,780
你这工作都做些什么  
So, what is it you do for...

156
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:09,860
我算是"贵妇伴侣"
I'm what's called "a lady's companion."

157
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:11,320
如果贵妇需要出钱才能有伴
If a lady has to pay for company,

158
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:13,280
那说明这位贵妇挺差劲的  不是吗
that says something about the lady, doesn't it?

159
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:16,360
可以点餐了吗
May I take your order?

160
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,950
一打牡蛎
Des huîtres, une douzaine.

161
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:20,950
早餐吃这个吗
For breakfast?

162
00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:23,320
按你听到的上  再续点咖啡
You heard her. Et encore du café.

163
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:26,110
好的  德温特先生  小姐
Bien, Monsieur de Winter. Mademoiselle.

164
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:31,610
请恕我冒昧  为何非得选择她
If it's not rude, why her?

165
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:32,730
感觉你似乎
Seems like you would 

166
00:08:32,730 --> 00:08:35,150
给很多人当伴侣都会非常出色
make an excellent companion for any number of people.

167
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:36,260
但我一直很喜欢到处旅行  
But I've always wanted to travel, 

168
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:38,860
除此之外  每年还有90镑的薪水
so there's that, and £90 a year.

169
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:42,230
我知道这些钱对你来说不算什么
I know that doesn't seem very much to you, 

170
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:44,360
但对我来说已经很多了
but it's a lot to me.

171
00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:47,240
这样看的话  孤独大概的确是有价格的吧
I suppose you can set a price on loneliness.

172
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,940
很奇怪  不是吗  有些人独自一人似乎也过得很好
It's odd, isn't it? Some people seem perfectly happy alone

173
00:08:49,950 --> 00:08:52,450
但有些人却需要别人陪着一起度过
while others just need someone to pass the time with. 

174
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:54,240
那个人是谁都没关系
Doesn't matter who.

175
00:08:55,070 --> 00:08:55,860
你是哪种
Which are you?

176
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:58,570
我父母都已经去世了  所以...
Well, my parents are dead, so... 

177
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,780
我习惯了独自一人
I'm used to being alone.

178
00:09:04,070 --> 00:09:05,360
你的早餐来了
Here comes your breakfast.

179
00:09:07,450 --> 00:09:09,780
请慢用  一打牡蛎
Et voilà. Une douzaine d'huîtres.

180
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:13,530
我一直都想尝尝  所以...
I've always wanted to try them, so...

181
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,740
趁着还新鲜  快尝尝
Try them before they get warm.

182
00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:35,530
太谢谢你了  感觉我从没说过这么多话
Thank you so much. I don't think I've ever spoken so much in my entire life.

183
00:09:35,530 --> 00:09:36,740
说得很精彩
It was very impressive.

184
00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:40,780
-抱歉我还点了牡蛎...  -不  没事的
- And I'm sorry about the oysters, too. I... - No, that was fine.

185
00:09:41,150 --> 00:09:42,690
非常谢谢你  我...
Thank you very much. I...

186
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:45,280
我很久都没那么开心过了
I haven't enjoyed myself like that for quite a long time.

187
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:50,700
再见
À bientôt.

188
00:10:11,650 --> 00:10:12,610
有人在吗
Hello?

189
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:19,860
-前台有张字条给您  -谢谢  夫人身体不适
- A note from the front desk. - Merci. Madame's indisposed.

190
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:22,030
-我会转交给她的  -是给您的  小姐
- I'll take it to her. - It's for you, mademoiselle.

191
00:10:24,030 --> 00:10:24,740
谢谢
Merci.

192
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:29,650

是前台  他们...
It was just the front desk, they were...

196
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:38,150
想知道您怎么样了
wondering how you are.

197
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:58,530
你是怎么脱身的
So how did you escape?

198
00:10:58,570 --> 00:10:59,820
我说我要上网球课
I said I had a tennis lesson.

199
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:01,400
她一直念叨我该增进球技
She's been on at me to improve my game.

200
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:02,450
真狡猾
Sneaky.

201
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:07,240
-你想去哪里  -哪里都可以
- So where do you want to go? - Anywhere is fine.

202
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:09,610
你肯定有想看看的地方吧
There must be somewhere you want to see.

203
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:11,490
就是有点远
Well, it's quite far.

204
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:14,360
不错  正好呼吸新鲜空气
Good. I could use the fresh air.

205
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:16,990
这是辆3.5升宾利吗
Is this a 3.5-liter Bentley?

206
00:11:16,990 --> 00:11:19,240
没错  你怎么会这么了解车
It is. How do you know so much about cars?

207
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:22,490
是我父亲  他生前很喜欢车
Oh, my father, he loved them.

208
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:25,740
能否问一下  你的双亲是什么时候去世的
If I may ask, when did your parents pass away?

209
00:11:27,070 --> 00:11:28,900
两年前  死于流感
Two winters ago. Influenza.

210
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:31,110
我母亲死于流感  我父亲...
Well, my mother died of influenza, and my...

211
00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:34,110
四天后也去了
father died just four days later.

212
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:38,490
你觉得会有人死于心碎吗
Do you think a person could die of a broken heart?

213
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:46,150
-我说话欠考虑了  对不起  -没事
- That was thoughtless of me. I'm sorry. - No.

214
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:54,300
没事的
It's all right.

215
00:11:55,450 --> 00:11:56,780
这才叫兜风
All part of the plan.

There's actually a cactus, it's native to Mexico,

218
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:12,990
能长到65英尺高
and it grows to 65 feet tall.

可以活200年  但从第70年起才能开花
It lives for 200 years, but it doesn't flower until it's 70.

220
00:12:17,950 --> 00:12:19,280
你都是从哪里学到这些的
Where do you learn this stuff?

221
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:21,940
从某处读来的  我知道的一切都来自书本
I read about it somewhere. Everything I know is from books.

我还没见过什么大世面
I haven't really experienced anything yet.

Have you been here before?

Yes. Yes, you can. You know how, don't you?

会是会  可我...
Well, yes, I...

Well, good. As long as you didn't learn from a book.

233
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:06,900
能和我说说曼陀丽庄园吗  听说那里很美
Will you tell me about Manderley? I hear it's beautiful.

234
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:08,740
的确很美
It is. Yeah.

235
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:11,990
曼陀丽不只是座宅邸  它是我生活的全部
Manderley, it's more than a house. It's my life.

236
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:15,740
几个世纪来都是由父辈把它传给子辈
It's been passed from father to son and father to son for centuries.

237
00:14:16,650 --> 00:14:17,990

Until now, anyway.

You see, if I die without an heir, it goes to my sister.

00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:27,990
-你在做什么  -你马上就知道了
- What are you doing? - Oh, you'll see.

275
00:17:35,450 --> 00:17:40,030
想象一下  如果能把回忆像香水一样装进瓶子
Imagine if you could bottle a memory like scent.

276
00:17:42,570 --> 00:17:44,650
你想开启它  就能随时开启它
Then, whenever you wanted, you could open it.

277
00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:48,490
就好像把那一瞬重新度过
It'd be like living the moment all over again.

278
00:17:50,950 --> 00:17:52,420
在你如此年轻的生命里
And what particular moments

279
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:54,820
你想把哪些瞬间装进瓶子
in your young life would you bottle?

280
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:58,200
这个星期  此时此刻  每一分钟
This week. Now. Every minute of it.

281
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:01,860
永远不会忘
Never forget it.

282
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:07,860
如果有不想要的回忆  就可以干脆丢掉
And any memories you didn't want, you could simply throw away.

283
00:18:12,570 --> 00:18:13,780
"一起去兜风"
"Come for a drive."

284
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:15,200
"去卡普代享用午餐"
"Lunch at the Cap."

285
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,610
去海滩
The beach.

286
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:34,400
可我喜欢这里的海岸
But I love the coast down here.

287
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:37,070
真的好美
It's so beautiful.

288
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:40,110
有意思了
Oh, there we go!

289
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:41,280
你在看什么
What are you looking at?

290
00:18:41,610 --> 00:18:45,150
-那个是...  -让我看看
- Um, well, it's... - Let me see.

291
00:18:45,490 --> 00:18:46,740
如果我是你  我不会看的
No, I wouldn't if I were you.

292
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:49,360
不行  幸好你并不是我
No... Well, it's just as well you're not...

293
00:18:56,610 --> 00:18:58,150
-对不起  -没关系
- Sorry. - That's all right.

294
00:18:59,110 --> 00:19:01,400
走吧  我们去游泳
Come on. Let's go for a swim.

295
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:05,030
走吧  走吧
Come on. Come on!

296
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:08,320
-快下来  -不了
- Come in! - No!

297
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:10,610
-为什么不  -我不想下来
- Why not? - I don't want to!

298
00:19:10,610 --> 00:19:12,280
你在怕什么
What are you afraid of?

299
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:15,740
水太冷  要冻坏了
It's too cold. No, it's freezing.

300
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:17,400
不冷  很舒服
No, it's not. It's lovely!

301
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:20,280
我能感觉得到  太冰了
I can feel it. It's freezing cold!

302
00:19:20,990 --> 00:19:23,860
-你快过来  -不  我要去把香槟喝光
- You come here! - No. I'm gonna drink all the champagne.

303
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:25,070
我无所谓
I don't care!

304
00:19:25,570 --> 00:19:27,360
天呐  瞧瞧你逼我做了什么
God! Look at what you're making me do.

305
00:20:56,610 --> 00:20:57,490
你起来了
Oh, you're up.

306
00:20:58,780 --> 00:20:59,990
我...
I, um...

307
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:04,450
你好转了真是太好了  护士呢
I'm so glad you're feeling better. Where's the nurse?

308
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:06,360
打发走了
Dismissed.

309
00:21:08,530 --> 00:21:11,490
看你像是游过泳  打完网球后游的
Took a swim, I see. After tennis?

310
00:21:12,610 --> 00:21:13,360
是的
Yes.

311
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:17,950
去吧  擦干头发  快去
Well, go on. Dry your hair. Chop-chop.

312
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:20,150
我们要下去吃晚餐吗
Are we going down for dinner?

313
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:22,360
我自己去
I am.

314
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:24,150
你可以安排前台服务生
You can see the concierge about

315
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:26,110
为我们订明天的早班火车票了
booking us on the early train tomorrow.

316
00:21:26,450 --> 00:21:27,990
行李也可以开始打包了
And you can set about packing.

317
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,200
明天
Um, tomorrow?

318
00:21:30,650 --> 00:21:32,490
比尔周六启航去纽约
Billy is sailing for New York on Saturday.

319
00:21:32,490 --> 00:21:34,070
我们可以乘同一艘船
We can catch the same boat.

320
00:21:34,490 --> 00:21:36,990
我在欧洲待得烦死了
I'm sick to death of Europe.

321
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,530
别这么失魂落魄地看着我
Don't look at me like a drowned rat.

322
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:46,610
你很快就能习惯纽约的生活
You'll get used to New York fast enough.

323
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:50,200
男人多得是  到处都新鲜
Plenty of boys and excitement.

324
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:52,650
而且都和你门当户对
All in your own class.

325
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:05,570
你真以为人们不会议论吗
Did you really think people wouldn't talk?

326
00:22:07,110 --> 00:22:08,480
断了是好事
Oh, you're best out of it.

327
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:11,440
所有人都知道她去世后他差点疯了
Everyone knows he nearly lost his mind after she died.

328
00:22:11,450 --> 00:22:13,990
不幸来得太突然了
It was all too sudden and tragic.

329
00:22:15,530 --> 00:22:18,320
你不会真以为他爱上你了吧
Do you honestly think he is in love with you?

330
00:22:20,030 --> 00:22:22,240
他只是拿你散散心  仅此而已
It was a distraction, dear. That's it.

331
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:26,320
我们要离开了  到纽约去
We'll go away. We'll go to New York.

332
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:28,400
你会找到你的出路的
You'll find your way.

333
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:31,200
你会把这一切都忘掉
You'll forget all about it.

334
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:35,400
相信我  你会把这一切都忘掉的
Trust me, you will forget all about it.

335
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,030
请等一下
Just a moment.

336
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,820
范·霍珀夫人要走了  我也必须离开
Mrs. Van Hopper is leaving and I have to go, too.

337
00:22:52,990 --> 00:22:55,030
-你在说什么  -真的  就现在  今天就走
- What are you talking about? -Yes. Now. Today.

338
00:22:55,030 --> 00:22:57,450
我就想跟你道个别
I just wanted to say goodbye.

339
00:22:57,860 --> 00:22:59,240
你怎么没和我提过
Why haven't you told me before?

340
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:01,150
因为她昨晚才决定的
Because she only decided it last night.

341
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:05,190
我们要去巴黎  和她的外甥碰面
And we're going to Paris with... to meet her nephew.

342
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:07,280
然后去瑟堡乘船去纽约
Then we go to Cherbourg to sail to New York.

343
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:09,070
听我说  你别哭
All right. Listen, you mustn't cry.

344
00:23:09,070 --> 00:23:11,360
给我一点时间想想
Just give me a moment to think.

345
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,200
我...
I...

346
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:16,860
我不能久留  她让我在楼下等
I can't stay long. She's expecting me downstairs.

347
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:21,650
跟我走吧
Come with me.

348
00:23:23,030 --> 00:23:23,650
什么
What?

349
00:23:24,450 --> 00:23:25,360
去曼陀丽庄园
To Manderley.

350
00:23:27,950 --> 00:23:31,150
什么  当你的秘书吗
What? As your secretary?

351
00:23:31,150 --> 00:23:33,110
不  不是
No. No.

352
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:35,650
当我的妻子
As my wife.

353
00:23:37,950 --> 00:23:40,320
我这是在向你求婚  小傻瓜
I'm asking you to marry me, you little fool.

354
00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:43,650
我不能去曼陀丽庄园
I can't come to Manderley.

355
00:23:43,650 --> 00:23:46,530
你当然可以  你说过你想看看这世界
Yes, you can. You said you wanted to see the world.

356
00:23:46,990 --> 00:23:48,990
曼陀丽就是这世上最美好的地方
Manderley is the best part of it.

357
00:23:50,070 --> 00:23:52,820
她当然在大厅  不然能去哪里
Well, of course she's down there. Where else is she?

358
00:23:53,070 --> 00:23:56,110
没错  我20分钟后就要出发去赶火车了
Yes, I've got to leave in 20 minutes to catch the train.

359
00:23:56,740 --> 00:23:58,030
-我去跟她说  -真的要去吗
- I'll tell her. - Do we have to go?

360
00:23:58,030 --> 00:24:00,610
不...当然要去了  其实我还挺想去会会她的
No, in fact... Yes, we do. I'm actually looking forward to this.

361
00:24:00,610 --> 00:24:02,360
我等的就是这句话
That's exactly what I'm waiting for.

362
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:04,360
别担心
Now, don't worry.

363
00:24:07,070 --> 00:24:08,150
又是谁啊
Who is this now?

364
00:24:19,650 --> 00:24:22,400
这是我这辈子听到过的最好的消息
This is the most wonderful news I've ever heard in my life!

365
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,150
真想赶紧告诉我的朋友们  太不可思议了
Wait till I tell my friends, I can't believe it!

366
00:24:24,150 --> 00:24:26,490
打算怎么安排婚事  拜托了  全都告诉我吧
What are the plans? Please. I must know everything.

367
00:24:26,490 --> 00:24:27,530
都已经安排好了
Well, the plans are settled.

368
00:24:27,530 --> 00:24:29,440
我们就在这里结婚  在欧洲度蜜月
We'll marry here, and honeymoon in Europe.

369
00:24:29,450 --> 00:24:31,570
然后回家  回曼陀丽庄园
And then home to Manderley.

370
00:24:31,570 --> 00:24:32,570
天呐
Oh, my goodness.

371
00:24:32,570 --> 00:24:34,940
你这辈子还没听过这么浪漫的话吧
Have you ever heard of anything more romantic in your life?

372
00:24:34,950 --> 00:24:36,320
"回曼陀丽庄园"
"Home to Manderley."

373
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:38,700
天呐  那可是童话故事里才有的
Oh, my goodness. It's out of a fairy tale.

374
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:42,240
好了  我先去打点一下
All right. I'll go and make sure

375
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,950
不然你的行李就要上火车了
your bags don't end up on the train.

376
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:46,530
-是要快点  -你没事的
- Do hurry. - You'll be fine.

377
00:24:46,530 --> 00:24:49,450
快去吧  我们有太多事情要聊了
Yes, yes, go along. We have lots to talk about.

378
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:56,610
我的天呐  你动作还挺快啊
Well, goodness gracious, don't you work quickly?

379
00:24:57,650 --> 00:24:59,860
你有做一些你不该做的事吗
Have you been doing things you shouldn't?

380
00:25:00,610 --> 00:25:01,780
我不懂你在说什么
I don't know what you mean.

381
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:07,570
不过幸好你家人都不在了  不用向他们解释
Well, you don't have a family, luckily, to explain it to.

382
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:09,860
这事我就不管了
I wash my hands of it.

383
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:12,700
到了曼陀丽庄园  肯定会安排个工作给你
Gonna have your work cut out for you at Manderley.

384
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:14,990
老实说  我觉得你不能胜任
And, frankly, I don't think you're up to it.

385
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:18,030
-我可以学  -这么跟你说吧  亲爱的
- I can learn. - Let me tell you something, honey.

386
00:25:20,150 --> 00:25:22,280
用性拴住男人很容易
When you trap a man between your legs,

387
00:25:22,650 --> 00:25:24,610
但他们不会留恋
they don't stick around for long.

388
00:25:28,570 --> 00:25:30,070
再见  范·霍珀夫人
Goodbye, Mrs. Van Hopper.

389
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:33,320
他娶你单纯是因为不想在那间老旧的大宅子里
He's only marrying you because he doesn't want to go on living

390
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:36,400
和她的鬼魂度过余生
in that big old house with her ghost!

391
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:38,280
我不相信有鬼魂
I don't believe in ghosts.

392
00:26:40,990 --> 00:26:44,150
天呐  我最讨厌他们这一套了
Oh, God. I hate it when they do this.

393
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:51,780
就不能低调一点吗
So much for keeping things quiet.

394
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:54,820
你也知道她的  老爷
You know how she is, sir.

395
00:26:55,610 --> 00:26:58,280
在曼陀丽有曼陀丽的规矩
There's a way things are done at Manderley.

396
00:26:59,450 --> 00:27:00,780
亲爱的  这是弗里思
Darling, this is Frith.

397
00:27:01,150 --> 00:27:01,860
你好
Hello.

398
00:27:09,450 --> 00:27:12,400
我们还是正式一点吧  来  起来咯
Let's do things properly, shall we? There we go.

399
00:27:12,860 --> 00:27:14,860
-你干什么呢  -怎么  你不喜欢啊
- What are you doing? - What? You don't like that?

400
00:27:15,030 --> 00:27:16,070
上肩
Up you go.

401
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,240
别这样了  迈克斯  放我下来
Don't, Max, put me down.

402
00:27:48,650 --> 00:27:49,780
丹弗斯太太
Mrs. Danvers.

403
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:52,280
欢迎来到曼陀丽庄园
Welcome to Manderley.

404
00:27:53,530 --> 00:27:54,990
你好  见到你很高兴
Hello. It's a pleasure.

405
00:28:02,990 --> 00:28:05,780
-谢谢  -茶泡好了
- Thank you. Thank you. - Tea is ready.

406
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:09,900
丹弗斯是这儿的管家
Danvers runs the house.

407
00:28:10,150 --> 00:28:12,150
别怕  她没看起来那么吓人
Don't worry, she's not as scary as she seems.

408
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:16,570
迈克西姆  这里太棒了
Oh, Maxim, it's wonderful!

409
00:28:19,150 --> 00:28:20,030
别吠了
Stop that.

410
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:24,280
游子可算回来了  见到你很高兴  迈克斯
There he is. The wanderer returns. Good to see you, Max.

411
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:26,820
-我也是  弗兰克  -旅途如何
- And you, Frank. - How was the trip?

412
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:30,740
结果还挺丰富多彩的
Was rather eventful, as it turns out.

413
00:28:30,950 --> 00:28:33,570
-我是弗兰克·克劳利  德温特夫人  -幸会
- Frank Crawley, Mrs. de Winter. - It's a pleasure.

414
00:28:33,570 --> 00:28:34,860
谢谢  你好
Thank you. Hello.

415
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:36,240
弗兰克是地产管理人
Frank's the estate manager.

416
00:28:36,530 --> 00:28:37,990
这里没了他可就完蛋了
The place would fall apart without him.

417
00:28:38,150 --> 00:28:40,740
他言过其实了  别听他的
Ah, no, no. He exaggerates. Ignore him.

418
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:45,820
我不想扫兴  但我有几份文件急需你签名
I, I hate to be a bore, but I urgently need a few signatures.

419
00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:47,950
我保证只借走他一下  马上还给你
I promise I'll have him back to you in a jiffy.

420
00:28:49,110 --> 00:28:50,610
-我们走吧  -好的
- Shall we? - Yes.

421
00:28:54,030 --> 00:28:57,990
丹弗斯  带德温特夫人转一圈  好吗
Danvers, show Mrs. de Winter the house. Can you?

422
00:28:57,990 --> 00:28:59,440
不用  没关系的  我等你
Oh, no, that's all right. I'll wait.

423
00:28:59,450 --> 00:29:03,200
别犯傻了  去吧  我过会儿来找你
No, don't be silly. Go on. I'll catch you up.

424
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:15,150
这座庄园已经在这家族名下三百多年了
The estate has been in the family for over 300 years.

425
00:29:16,030 --> 00:29:18,070
最初是亨利八世赠予的礼物
It was originally a gift from Henry VIII.

426
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:21,530
太非凡了
Extraordinary.

427
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:27,900
如果有客人来了  您可以用客厅招待
If there are guests, you may use the drawing room.

428
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:30,530
记得告诉弗里思  让他点燃炉火
Don't forget to tell Frith to light the fires,

429
00:29:30,530 --> 00:29:32,780
不过一般来说  老爷喜欢
but generally, Mr. de Winter prefers

430
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:35,700
在书房这里喝咖啡
to take his coffee here in the library.

431
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:39,740
还好有你在  丹弗斯太太
Glad you're here, Mrs. Danvers. I'll...

432
00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:41,360
不然我肯定记不住这一切
I'll Never remember all this.

433
00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:46,950
{\an8}{\pos(50,40)}吕蓓卡·德温特
弗兰克·克劳利先生
曼陀丽庄园
康沃尔

434
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:47,740
如果您担心的是这个  夫人
Oh, I'm sure you won't disappoint him, madam,

435
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:49,280
您一定不会让他失望的
if that's your concern.

436
00:29:50,650 --> 00:29:53,240
德温特家族可追溯到都铎王朝
The de Winter family dates back to the Tudors.

437
00:29:53,490 --> 00:29:55,900
那是谁
And, um, who's that?

438
00:29:57,070 --> 00:30:00,150
那是卡罗琳·德温特  老爷的姑婆
That's Caroline de Winter. Mr. de Winter's great aunt.

439
00:30:00,150 --> 00:30:01,400
她好妩媚动人
She's very striking.

440
00:30:01,530 --> 00:30:03,610
是的  她可是英国第一批
Yes, and one of the first women

441
00:30:03,610 --> 00:30:05,700
获得医生执照的女性之一
to qualify as a doctor in England.

442
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,490
这是其中一幅老爷最喜欢的画作
It's one of his favorites.

443
00:30:09,780 --> 00:30:11,240
大家都睡在哪儿
Where does everyone sleep?

444
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:14,070
女仆睡阁楼  男仆睡地下室
Maids in the attic, men below stairs,

445
00:30:14,070 --> 00:30:16,280
应该和你待过的地方一个规矩吧
just as in your other houses, I presume.

446
00:30:17,950 --> 00:30:20,320
我从没见过这么壮观的大宅
Never even seen a house like this.

447
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:25,450
抱歉  我以为你当过贴身女仆呢
Oh, I'm sorry. I thought you'd been a lady's maid.

448
00:30:26,450 --> 00:30:28,530
主卧现在搬到东厢了
The master bedroom is now in the east wing.

449
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:47,530
这花纹真好看
What a... pretty pattern.

450
00:30:49,150 --> 00:30:53,450
这是克拉丽斯  在您的女仆来之前负责服侍您
This is Clarice. She'll look after you until your maid gets here.

451
00:30:53,990 --> 00:30:57,360
我没有雇女仆  不过我自己能应付得过来
I don't have a maid, but I'm sure I'll manage without one.

452
00:30:58,610 --> 00:31:00,700
你会需要一个的
Well, I think you'll find you need one.

453
00:31:01,870 --> 00:31:04,970
那就让克拉丽斯来吧
Perhaps Clarice could take the position.

454
00:31:07,990 --> 00:31:09,310
这里看不见大海
You can't see the sea from here.

455
00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:10,930
是看不见
No, you can't.

456
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:14,570
如果老爷要他以前的衣橱
Should Mr. de Winter ask for his old wardrobe,

457
00:31:14,570 --> 00:31:16,600
恐怕您得告诉他这里会放不下
I'm afraid you must tell him it wouldn't fit here.

458
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:18,770
住宅这一面的房间要小很多
The rooms on this side of the house are much smaller.

459
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:21,640
这里以前不是他的卧室吗
This wasn't his bedroom before?

460
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:26,390
不是的  德温特夫人的房间都在西厢
No, no, no. No. Mrs. de Winter's rooms were in the west wing.

461
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:33,890
这里多好啊  空着太可惜了
Well, it's a lovely room. Much too nice to stand empty.

462
00:31:34,150 --> 00:31:36,310
客房都不会空闲太久的
The guest rooms are never empty for very long.

463
00:31:39,450 --> 00:31:42,560
德温特夫人还在世时  我们办过很多次宴会
We did a lot of entertaining when the late Mrs. de Winter was alive.

464
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:45,600
曼陀丽舞会在当时可是件大事
The Manderley ball was quite an event.

465
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:49,020
我就让克拉丽斯陪您了
I'll leave you with Clarice.

466
00:31:57,990 --> 00:31:59,270
问我个问题
Ask me a question.

467
00:32:01,950 --> 00:32:03,020
什么问题
What sort of question?

468
00:32:05,110 --> 00:32:05,890
什么都行
Anything.

469
00:32:08,070 --> 00:32:10,140
我对你毫无保留
I have no secrets from you.

470
00:32:11,650 --> 00:32:14,520
既然我们结婚了  难道不应该坦诚相待吗
Don't you think that's how it should be now that we're married?

471
00:32:15,990 --> 00:32:17,930
所有的婚姻都隐藏着秘密
All marriages have their secrets.

472
00:32:22,110 --> 00:32:26,640
如果你愿意  可以和我说说她
You can talk to me about her... if you want.

473
00:32:37,030 --> 00:32:38,020
晚安  亲爱的
Good night, darling.

474
00:33:46,870 --> 00:33:47,770
迈克西姆
Maxim?

475
00:34:28,490 --> 00:34:29,310
别碰他
Leave him.

476
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:33,140
叫醒梦游的人很危险
It's dangerous to wake a sleepwalker.

477
00:35:49,950 --> 00:35:53,740
不用担心  但马厩需要翻修屋顶
And nothing to worry about, but the stables will need reroofing

478
00:35:53,740 --> 00:35:55,310
因为瓦片都腐烂了
because the tiles are spoiled...

479
00:35:57,150 --> 00:35:58,930
-早上好  亲爱的  -早上好
- Good morning, darling. - Good morning.

480
00:35:59,070 --> 00:36:00,720
-睡得怎么样  -挺好的
- Sleep well? - Yes, not bad.

481
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:04,310
来
Come.

482
00:36:06,110 --> 00:36:08,780
-您适应得如何  -非常好  谢谢
- How are you settling in? - Very well, thank you.

483
00:36:08,780 --> 00:36:10,310
那就好  那就好
Good. Good.

484
00:36:11,490 --> 00:36:14,720
那我去上面等您
I'll... see you up there, shall I?

485
00:36:14,860 --> 00:36:16,930
-我马上就来  -再见  德温特夫人
- Won't be a sec. - Mrs. de Winter.

486
00:36:16,950 --> 00:36:17,930
再见  克劳利先生
Mr. Crawley.

487
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:20,970
叫我弗兰克就好
Frank. It's Frank.

488
00:36:24,530 --> 00:36:25,780
我该早点起床的
I should have got up earlier.

489
00:36:25,780 --> 00:36:28,220
-我们就能共用早餐了  -没关系
- We could have had breakfast together. - Oh, that's all right.

490
00:36:30,860 --> 00:36:32,390
你知道你会梦游吗
Did you know you sleepwalk?

491
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:38,390
好好享用早餐吧
Enjoy your breakfast.

492
00:37:02,110 --> 00:37:02,890
杰斯珀
Jasper!

493
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:14,970
你要去哪儿  杰斯珀
Where are you going? Jasper!

494
00:37:17,530 --> 00:37:19,140
杰斯珀  你跑去哪了
Jasper, where have you gone?

500
00:39:01,070 --> 00:39:02,990
克拉丽斯  你看见老爷了吗
Clarice, have you seen Mr. de Winter?

501
00:39:02,990 --> 00:39:05,650
你有药膏吗  我割伤手了
And do you have a plaster? I've cut my hand.

502
00:39:05,650 --> 00:39:06,350
让我看看
Let me see.

503
00:39:06,610 --> 00:39:09,020
-没什么大碍  我没事  -天呐  等一下
- Really, it's nothing. I'm fine. - Oh, my. One moment.

正好你在  夫人
Since you're here, madam,

505
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:14,930
请问今天的菜单是不是合意
may I have your approval for today's menus?

506
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:20,720
好  非常合适  我完全满意
Yes. Good. Very suitable. Very nice indeed.

507
00:39:21,110 --> 00:39:24,220
-烤小牛肉的酱汁呢  -那款看起来非常好
- And the sauce for the roast veal? - Yes, that looks excellent.

508
00:39:24,650 --> 00:39:26,350
不  我空着没填
No, but I've left it blank, you see?

509
00:39:27,780 --> 00:39:31,060
德温特夫人非常讲究酱汁
Mrs. de Winter was most particular about her sauces.

510
00:39:33,150 --> 00:39:34,100
好  那...
Right. Well, um...

511
00:39:36,950 --> 00:39:39,310
就按德温特夫人的喜好来吧  谢谢
We'll have whatever Mrs. de Winter would have had. Thank you.

512
00:39:39,650 --> 00:39:40,600
好的  夫人
Very well, madam.

513
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:45,390
-好了  -非常感谢
- There we go. - Thank you very much.

515
00:40:19,860 --> 00:40:21,390
你还好吗  亲爱的
Is everything all right, darling?

516
00:40:21,740 --> 00:40:26,560
我想从伦敦订一些新内衣
I was thinking of... ordering some new undergarments from London.

517
00:40:27,990 --> 00:40:31,220
带蕾丝的内衣  还要一套睡衣
Something lacy and a nightgown.

518
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:36,470
我什么时候抱怨过你的穿着
When have I ever complained about what you wear?

519
00:40:45,780 --> 00:40:48,020
这样真好  对吧  你我二人世界
This is nice, isn't it? Just us.

520
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:50,100
就好像回到了度蜜月的时候
It's almost like we're back on our honeymoon.

521
00:40:52,110 --> 00:40:53,560
我好怀念啊  你呢
Oh, I miss it. Don't you?

522
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:57,470
开车兜风  四处探索  小咖啡馆
Driving, the exploring, little cafes?

523
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:01,600
看到旧旧的旅馆就住下
Seeing some funny old hotel and just staying there.

524
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:03,720
那不是真实生活  亲爱的
That's not real life, darling.

525
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:08,390
-杰斯珀  杰斯珀  -我去追
- Jasper! Jasper! - I'll get him.

526
00:41:08,530 --> 00:41:10,890
别管它  它能找到回来的路
No, just leave him. He'll find his own way back.

527
00:41:11,150 --> 00:41:12,990
太陡峭了  万一它掉下去呢
It's so steep. What if he falls?

528
00:41:12,990 --> 00:41:14,220
我说了别管它
I said leave him!

00:41:30,820 --> 00:41:31,640
杰斯珀

533
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:46,350
杰斯珀  快出来
Jasper, come out of there.

00:42:13,990 --> 00:42:15,270
杰斯珀  过来
Jasper, come here.

535
00:42:16,990 --> 00:42:19,310
好了  找条绳子把你拴上
All right, get something to tie you with.

我不知道这里还住人
I didn't realize that anyone lived here.

541
00:43:22,030 --> 00:43:24,720
我不住这儿  我住在看守人的小屋
No, I don't, do I? Live up in the keeper's cottage.

542
00:43:25,650 --> 00:43:28,020
我从上午就一直在挖贝壳
I've been digging for shells since forenoon.

543
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:30,720
你也在挖贝壳吗
Oh, you've been digging for shells? Huh?

544
00:43:32,820 --> 00:43:33,890
没有  我...
No. I just, I...

545
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:37,510
我需要条绳子拴狗
I needed something to tie my dog with.

546
00:43:37,510 --> 00:43:38,600
我马上就不打扰你了
I'll be out of your way in a moment.

547
00:43:38,780 --> 00:43:40,600
-它又不是你的狗  -对  不是
- He ain't yourn. - Oh, no.

548
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:43,140
-是德温特先生的  -不
- He's Mr. de Winter's dog. - No.

549
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:44,930
是她的狗
That's her dog.

550
00:43:46,990 --> 00:43:48,810
她不再来这里了
She don't come here no more.

551
00:43:49,610 --> 00:43:53,640
她掉进海里了  对吧
She... she gone into the sea, ain't she?

552
00:43:55,150 --> 00:43:56,600
淹死了
She drowned.

553
00:43:59,900 --> 00:44:01,220
你不像她
You ain't like her.

554
00:44:05,650 --> 00:44:07,890
是  来吧  杰斯珀
Yes. Come on, Jasper.

555
00:44:09,150 --> 00:44:11,350
我什么都没说
I never said nothin', did I?

556
00:44:12,610 --> 00:44:14,180
来吧  杰斯珀  走吧
Come on, Jasper. Come on.

557
00:44:26,700 --> 00:44:28,520
我知道你为什么不想来这边了
I know why you didn't want to come down here.

558
00:44:31,820 --> 00:44:33,020
我怎么知道
How am I supposed to know?

559
00:44:33,990 --> 00:44:36,060
你什么都不说  我怎么知道
How am I supposed to know anything if you don't tell me?

560
00:44:36,700 --> 00:44:39,060
-那里本来应该锁上  -有人在里面
- That's supposed to be locked. - There was someone in there.

561
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:43,220
很可能是看守人的儿子  贝恩  他与世无争
Probably just the keeper's son, Ben. He's harmless enough.

562
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:44,270
迈克西姆  我...
Maxim, I...

563
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:09,970
天呐
Oh, God!

564
00:45:13,070 --> 00:45:14,890
-那是在意大利时  -瞧瞧他
- That's in Italy. - There he is.

565
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:17,930
对  那是婚礼刚刚结束时拍的
Oh, yes. That was just after the wedding.

566
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:22,180
这条纯色连衣裙真漂亮
What a nice plain frock.

567
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:26,390
迈克斯说得对  你跟我想象中完全不一样
Look, Max was right. You're not at all what I expected.

568
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:29,470
你看着好些了  老头子
And you're looking better, old man.

569
00:45:29,780 --> 00:45:30,930
没那么憔悴了
Not so drawn.

570
00:45:31,240 --> 00:45:32,690
-我哪有  -胡说八道
- Please. - Bosh!

571
00:45:32,700 --> 00:45:35,890
大家都知道你六个月前有多么失魂落魄
Everyone knows you were a perfect wreck six months ago.

572
00:45:37,150 --> 00:45:39,430
给  奶奶  你看过这些照片吗
Here, Granny, have you seen these?

573
00:45:39,780 --> 00:45:41,180
是不是很好看
Look, aren't they lovely?

574
00:45:41,860 --> 00:45:43,390
-天呐  -嗯
- Goodness! - Yes.

575
00:45:43,650 --> 00:45:45,310
这些是我们婚礼上拍的
So, these were from our wedding.

576
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:49,060
我听说你不打猎是怎么回事
What's all this I hear about you not hunting?

577
00:45:49,780 --> 00:45:51,490
对  我不会骑马
Oh, no, I'm afraid I don't ride.

578
00:45:51,490 --> 00:45:54,470
不会骑马怎么行  你会错失很多乐趣的
Oh, but you must! Or you'll miss out on all the fun.

579
00:45:54,820 --> 00:45:56,350
来跟我们住吧  我教你
Come and stay. I can teach you.

580
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:58,320
她是全郡最厉害的女骑士了
You won't find a finer horsewoman in the county.

581
00:45:58,320 --> 00:45:59,720
别说了  贾尔斯
Do dry up, Giles.

582
00:45:59,820 --> 00:46:01,190
我姐姐发现她觉得有趣的事
Yes, it might shock my sister to learn

583
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:03,310
并不会引起所有人共鸣  会很震惊的
that not everyone shares her idea of fun.

584
00:46:03,780 --> 00:46:07,140
不管她觉得什么有趣  她都理应好好玩玩
Well, whatever her idea of fun, she certainly deserves to have some.

585
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:11,810
事实上  我在考虑恢复办舞会
Well, actually, I've been thinking I might revive the ball.

586
00:46:17,450 --> 00:46:18,560
这主意真不错
What a marvelous idea.

587
00:46:19,570 --> 00:46:21,270
我们没谈过这个
That's not something we discussed.

588
00:46:22,070 --> 00:46:24,470
别那么扫兴
Oh, don't be so damn miserable.

589
00:46:24,990 --> 00:46:26,430
你以前很喜欢的
You used to love it.

590
00:46:27,070 --> 00:46:29,640
你可以为你的新娘办一场
You can hold it in honor of your new bride.

591
00:46:33,650 --> 00:46:34,310
好吧
Fine.

592
00:46:36,150 --> 00:46:37,930
那就这么定了
Well, that's settled, then.

593
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:40,640
-敬我们的新女主人  -敬新女主人
- To our new hostess. - Yeah. To our new hostess.

594
00:46:42,280 --> 00:46:45,350
你要在曼陀丽庄园暂住吗  亲爱的
Are you staying at Manderley, dear?

595
00:46:45,700 --> 00:46:46,850
-她就在这生活  -不
- She lives here. - Oh, no.

596
00:46:46,860 --> 00:46:49,470
-记得吗  奶奶  -奶奶  我们给你介绍过的
- Remember, Granny? - Granny, we introduced you.

597
00:46:49,650 --> 00:46:51,680
她是迈克西姆的妻子
She's Maxim's wife.

598
00:46:52,990 --> 00:46:55,020
她才不是
No, she is not.

599
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:05,350
她不是迈克西姆的妻子
She's not Maxim's wife.

600
00:47:06,900 --> 00:47:08,810
多么愚蠢的想法
What a silly notion.

601
00:47:11,900 --> 00:47:15,600
办舞会真是个好主意
Well, it's... good news about the ball, uh...

602
00:47:16,030 --> 00:47:17,520
太久没办了
It's been far too long.

603
00:47:17,900 --> 00:47:19,600
我不记得你
I don't remember you.

604
00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:22,140
不  我...
Oh, no, I...

605
00:47:22,740 --> 00:47:24,930
我们之前没见过
We haven't met before.

606
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:29,470
迈克西姆  这孩子是谁
Maxim, who is this child?

607
00:47:29,860 --> 00:47:32,310
天呐  好吧  带奶奶回家吧
Oh, Christ. All right, let's get Granny home now.

608
00:47:32,740 --> 00:47:34,560
你对吕蓓卡做了什么
What have you done with Rebecca?

609
00:47:34,990 --> 00:47:36,240
-你别管  -不  我来
- Leave it. - No, I've got it!

610
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:37,780
我要见吕蓓卡
I want to see Rebecca.

611
00:47:37,780 --> 00:47:39,400
-别碰我  -她就是有点...
- Please, leave me alone! - She just gets a little...

612
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:42,220
每天的这个时候  再加上这天气...
it's the time of day, and the weather...

613
00:47:44,610 --> 00:47:46,260
-天呐  -我就想...
- Oh, my! - I just want to...

614
00:47:46,260 --> 00:47:47,280
让她上车
Get her in the car.

615
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:49,100
我把她抱进车里  你去跟她说
I'll put her in the car. You go and talk to her.

616
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:51,060
我们上车吧  奶奶  来
Listen, let's get in the car, Granny. Come on.

617
00:47:51,070 --> 00:47:54,180
这是从花房拿的  希望可以
This is from the flower room. I hope that's all right.

618
00:47:54,200 --> 00:47:55,770
-谢谢  -对不起
- Thank you. - Look, I apologize.

619
00:47:55,950 --> 00:47:59,020
我忘记奶奶有多喜欢吕蓓卡了
I'd forgotten how fond our grandmother was of Rebecca.

620
00:47:59,950 --> 00:48:00,570
我没事
I'm fine.

621
00:48:00,570 --> 00:48:03,680
她就是那么气人
She was just one of those bloody annoying people.

622
00:48:03,950 --> 00:48:05,270
每个人都无法抗拒她
Irresistible to everybody.

623
00:48:05,270 --> 00:48:08,770
无论是男人  女人  孩子  还是动物
The men, women, children, animals.

624
00:48:09,860 --> 00:48:12,890
我们这些凡人根本没法比
Us mere mortals couldn't hope to compete.

625
00:48:44,780 --> 00:48:46,100
-老爷  -他哭什么
- Sir. - Why is he crying?

626
00:48:46,610 --> 00:48:48,610
老爷  晨室里
Sir, one of the porcelain pieces

627
00:48:48,610 --> 00:48:49,820
有一件瓷器不见了
is missing from the morning room,

628
00:48:49,820 --> 00:48:52,070
现在丹弗斯太太要开除这个男孩
and now Danvers is calling for the boy's dismissal.

629
00:48:52,070 --> 00:48:53,350
-但不是...  -哪一件
- But it wasn't... - Which piece?

630
00:48:53,570 --> 00:48:54,640
我们不确定  老爷
We're not sure, sir.

631
00:48:55,450 --> 00:48:56,270
丹弗斯太太
Danvers!

632
00:48:57,450 --> 00:49:00,220
-没什么事吧  -没事
- Is everything all right? - Yes, it's fine.

633
00:49:00,360 --> 00:49:02,300
晨室里有样东西不见了
Something rather's just gone missing from the morning room.

634
00:49:02,300 --> 00:49:02,880
仅此而已
That's all.

635
00:49:03,030 --> 00:49:05,930
-丹弗斯太太  -什么东西不见了
- Danvers! - What is it? What's gone missing?

636
00:49:08,610 --> 00:49:10,390
你为什么觉得是罗伯特拿的
What on earth makes you think Robert took it?

637
00:49:11,570 --> 00:49:13,990
德累斯顿瓷器非常值钱  老爷
The Dresden is extremely valuable, sir.

638
00:49:13,990 --> 00:49:16,150
-不是我干的  -单那一件就价值一百多镑
- But it wasn't me! - That piece alone is worth £100.

639
00:49:16,150 --> 00:49:18,970
-老爷  不太可能是...  -那是谁干的  弗里思
- Sir, I find it most unlikely... - Then who, Frith?

640
00:49:19,990 --> 00:49:23,100
干杂活的女仆是不能进晨室的  我负责收拾
The between maid isn't allowed in the morning room. I do it.

641
00:49:23,820 --> 00:49:25,990
德温特夫人还在世的时候  我们一起收拾瓷器
When Mrs. de Winter was alive, we did it together.

642
00:49:25,990 --> 00:49:27,810
-弗里思只是说...  -是我
- All Frith is saying... - It was me.

643
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:35,180
是我打碎的  它碎了
I broke it. It broke.

644
00:49:35,900 --> 00:49:38,430
我不小心打碎的  它掉到地上了
It was an accident. It fell.

645
00:49:41,820 --> 00:49:43,850
好了  真相大白
Well, there we go.

646
00:49:44,650 --> 00:49:46,270
罗伯特  你没事了
Robert, you're off the hook.

647
00:49:51,570 --> 00:49:52,810
碎片在哪儿  夫人
Where are the pieces, madam?

648
00:49:54,650 --> 00:49:57,390
在后面的书桌抽屉里
In the bureau drawer at the back.

649
00:49:57,860 --> 00:50:00,150
寄到伦敦去  丹弗斯太太  看能不能修补
Send them to London, Danvers. See if anything can be done.

650
00:50:00,150 --> 00:50:01,100
没问题  老爷
Certainly, sir.

651
00:50:01,450 --> 00:50:04,780
如果再发生这种事
And may I suggest, should anything like this happen again,

652
00:50:04,780 --> 00:50:06,810
德温特夫人能不能直接告诉我
that Mrs. de Winter tell me herself.

653
00:50:08,280 --> 00:50:09,770
都没事了吧
If we're all quite finished?

654
00:50:31,580 --> 00:50:34,270
{\an8}吕

655
00:52:06,490 --> 00:52:07,350
弗兰克
Oh, Frank.

656
00:52:08,450 --> 00:52:09,310
德温特夫人
Mrs. de Winter.

657
00:52:10,650 --> 00:52:12,430
我还以为你跟迈克斯去伦敦了
I thought you'd gone up to London with Max.

658
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:14,390
他在伦敦吗
He's in London?

659
00:52:14,990 --> 00:52:17,680
对  去处理文件了
Yeah. Taking care of some paperwork.

660
00:52:19,240 --> 00:52:21,520
他让我给这里加把锁  我差点把你锁在里面
He asked me to put a padlock on here. I nearly locked you in.

661
00:52:23,320 --> 00:52:24,140
真可惜
It's a shame.

662
00:52:26,110 --> 00:52:27,930
这里要荒废了
This place going to ruin.

663
00:52:28,900 --> 00:52:32,310
现在没船了
Well... no boat now.

664
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:36,850
迈克斯不喜欢驾船出海
Max doesn't like to sail.

665
00:52:53,150 --> 00:52:54,470
贝恩说她是淹死的
Ben said she drowned.

666
00:52:57,360 --> 00:52:59,430
抱歉  我以为你知道
I'm sorry. I assumed you knew.

667
00:53:00,450 --> 00:53:04,220
-我不知道  -那天天气很差
- No. - Ah, it's... It was brutal weather.

668
00:53:05,780 --> 00:53:07,600
即便对她这个好驾船人来说
Even for her. She was an excellent sailor.

669
00:53:08,860 --> 00:53:09,850
船沉了
The boat went down.

670
00:53:11,700 --> 00:53:12,720
一直没找到
They never recovered it.

671
00:53:14,320 --> 00:53:17,770
两个月后她被冲上了埃奇库姆的岸边
She washed up in Edgcumbe some... two months later.

672
00:53:18,570 --> 00:53:21,310
两个月  天呐
Two months? My God!

673
00:53:22,900 --> 00:53:23,970
可怜的迈克西姆
Poor Maxim.

674
00:53:24,820 --> 00:53:27,770
是我载他去认了尸体
Drove him down there myself to identify the body.

675
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:33,180
你不必为过去所扰
You know, you really mustn't dwell on the past.

676
00:53:33,530 --> 00:53:35,770
你们很般配  他已经走出来了
You're so good for Max. He's a changed man.

677
00:53:37,950 --> 00:53:39,310
她当时一定很害怕
She must have been so afraid.

678
00:53:41,570 --> 00:53:42,520
一个人在海上
Out there alone.

679
00:53:43,950 --> 00:53:45,140
她什么都不怕
She wasn't afraid of anything.

680
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:57,310
我能问你点事吗  弗兰克  跟我说实话
Can I ask you something, Frank? And promise to tell me the truth.

681
00:53:58,360 --> 00:54:00,890
这不公平  我还不知道你要问什么呢
Hardly fair, isn't it. Don't know what you're gonna ask me.

682
00:54:02,360 --> 00:54:04,100
吕蓓卡很美吗
Was Rebecca very beautiful?

683
00:54:08,490 --> 00:54:09,180
是的
Yes.

684
00:54:12,650 --> 00:54:14,140
我想她是...
Yes, I suppose she was...

685
00:54:15,360 --> 00:54:18,350
我这辈子见过的最美的人
the most beautiful creature I ever saw in my life.

686
00:55:11,990 --> 00:55:13,990
{\an8}吕

687
00:55:13,990 --> 00:55:15,930
这裙子的确很美  不是吗
It is beautiful, isn't it?

688
00:55:18,110 --> 00:55:19,810
我把它照原样放着
I keep it just the way it was.

689
00:55:21,240 --> 00:55:23,430
就好像她只是出去一会儿
It's as if she'd just gone out for a while.

690
00:55:24,780 --> 00:55:25,850
你吓了我一跳
You startled me.

691
00:55:28,110 --> 00:55:29,430
这件是她的最爱
This was her favorite.

692
00:55:32,490 --> 00:55:34,310
那晚我替她摆在床上
I laid it out for her that night.

693
00:55:42,740 --> 00:55:44,140
来  拿着
Go on, hold it.

694
00:55:45,740 --> 00:55:46,560
摸摸看
Touch it.

695
00:55:51,950 --> 00:55:54,430
她不要贴身女仆
She wouldn't have a lady's maid, you know.

696
00:55:54,700 --> 00:55:56,520
她说  "丹尼  我除了你谁也不要"
"I don't want anyone but you, Danny."

697
00:55:58,950 --> 00:56:00,680
你看到她有多高了吗
Do you see how tall she was?

698
00:56:06,530 --> 00:56:08,720
以她的身材穿什么都很好看
Hmm. She could wear anything with a figure like hers.

699
00:56:11,110 --> 00:56:14,970
每晚我都会替她梳头发
I'd brush her hair for her every evening.

700
00:56:18,320 --> 00:56:20,600
她会说  "快来  丹尼  帮我梳头发"
"Come on, Danny, hair drill." she'd say.

701
00:56:22,320 --> 00:56:23,810
我会站在她身后
I'd stand behind her

702
00:56:24,990 --> 00:56:28,310
每次为她梳上20分钟
and brush away for 20 minutes at a time.

703
00:56:29,820 --> 00:56:32,890
她有一头浓密的深色秀发
That great mass of dark hair.

704
00:56:37,610 --> 00:56:38,680
他会加入
He joined in.

705
00:56:40,820 --> 00:56:42,350
他很喜欢为她这样做
He loved to do that for her.

706
00:56:44,530 --> 00:56:47,470
他们会为晚宴打扮  客人们都在楼下等着
They'd be dressing for dinner, guests waiting downstairs.

707
00:56:47,820 --> 00:56:49,560
"再用力点  迈克斯  再用力点"
"Harder, Max, harder!"

708
00:56:50,650 --> 00:56:52,890
他就会放声大笑
And he'd roar with laughter.

709
00:56:54,950 --> 00:56:56,970
那时他总是开怀大笑
He was always laughing back then.

710
00:57:02,860 --> 00:57:04,180
他会帮你梳头发吗
Does he brush your hair?

711
00:57:05,990 --> 00:57:06,680
不会
No.

712
00:57:10,070 --> 00:57:12,820
丹弗斯太太
Mrs. Danvers,

713
00:57:12,820 --> 00:57:15,070
是老爷叫你把房间维持原样的吗
does Mr. de Winter ask you to keep the room like this?

714
00:57:15,070 --> 00:57:16,180
他不必说出口
He doesn't have to.

715
00:57:17,490 --> 00:57:18,600
她还在这里
She's still here.

716
00:57:20,900 --> 00:57:21,770
你能感觉到她吗
Can you feel her?

717
00:57:24,200 --> 00:57:26,640
我很好奇她怎么看你
I wonder what she's thinking about you.

718
00:57:27,490 --> 00:57:31,560
抢走她的丈夫  用着她的名字
Taking her husband and... using her name.

719
00:57:34,820 --> 00:57:37,110
-她肯定希望他快乐  -快乐
- I'm sure she'd want him to be happy. - Happy?

720
00:57:37,110 --> 00:57:38,390
不  他永远不会再快乐了
No, he'll never be happy.

721
00:57:41,820 --> 00:57:43,640
她是他的一生挚爱
She was the love of his life.

722
00:58:15,650 --> 00:58:16,310
迈克西姆
Maxim?

723
00:58:32,740 --> 00:58:33,640
早上好  夫人
Good morning, madam.

724
00:58:35,110 --> 00:58:38,520
天呐  你抓伤了自己
Oh, dear! You've been scratchin'.

725
00:59:16,990 --> 00:59:17,770
想我了吗
Have we missed ya?

726
00:59:22,320 --> 00:59:25,640
你好  想必你是新的德温特夫人了
Hello! You must be the new Mrs. de Winter.

727
00:59:26,240 --> 00:59:28,100
我想你弄错了
Uh, I think there's been a mistake.

728
00:59:28,610 --> 00:59:31,640
-德温特先生在伦敦  -他把你一个人留在这儿吗
- Mr. de Winter's in London. - He's left you on your own?

729
00:59:32,070 --> 00:59:34,720
他不怕有无赖来把你抢走吗
Isn't he afraid some bounder might come and carry you off?

730
00:59:35,240 --> 00:59:37,430
我是杰克·费弗尔  你好
I'm Jack Favell. How do you do?

731
00:59:43,030 --> 00:59:45,100
你想把名片留下吗
Well, did you want to leave your card?

732
00:59:46,450 --> 00:59:48,740
而且如此礼貌  都不好意思直接叫我滚
And too polite to tell me to bugger off.

733
00:59:48,740 --> 00:59:50,270
你真是个甜心
You are a sweetheart.

734
00:59:50,490 --> 00:59:52,600
不用担心  我只是过来看看丹尼
Not to worry. I just popped by to see Danny.

735
00:59:52,950 --> 00:59:54,430
她邀请我来喝茶
She's invited me for tea.

736
00:59:55,450 --> 00:59:58,680
-但我到得太早了  -丹弗斯太太吗
- I'm horribly early, though. - Mrs. Danvers?

737
00:59:59,360 --> 01:00:01,320
所以我想着先在附近转转
That's why I thought I'd better hover around out here,

738
01:00:01,320 --> 01:00:03,680
否则我可能会被她打手腕
otherwise I might get a smack on the wrist.

739
01:00:10,700 --> 01:00:13,560
费弗尔先生  你去哪里
Mr. Favell? Where are you going?

740
01:00:15,110 --> 01:00:15,990
查理  过来
Charlie, come on.

741
01:00:15,990 --> 01:00:17,390
-等等  费弗尔先生  -来了  先生
- Excuse me, Mr. Favell! - Coming, sir.

742
01:00:19,360 --> 01:00:20,970
-菲利帕  -进来  查理
- Phillippa! - Come on in, Charlie.

743
01:00:22,610 --> 01:00:23,470
吁  吁  吁  别激动
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Stand down.

744
01:00:23,990 --> 01:00:26,100
-放松  星光  -冷静
- Easy, Starlight, easy. - Steady.

745
01:00:26,200 --> 01:00:28,430
你精力太旺盛了  他们一直忽视你
You've got too much energy. They've been neglecting you.

746
01:00:29,150 --> 01:00:30,390
我不感到意外
That's not a surprise.

747
01:00:30,740 --> 01:00:33,520
只有吕蓓卡能治住你  不是吗
Rebecca was the only one who could handle you, wasn't she, old boy?

748
01:00:33,650 --> 01:00:34,520
是的
Yes.

749
01:00:35,450 --> 01:00:36,520
你认识吕蓓卡吗
You knew Rebecca?

750
01:00:38,610 --> 01:00:41,140
她是我表妹
She's my cousin. Was.

751
01:00:43,740 --> 01:00:44,430
好了
That's it.

752
01:00:45,450 --> 01:00:46,970
我们拉匹马出去转转吧
Let's take one of the horses out for a turn.

753
01:00:47,070 --> 01:00:49,720
不了  我不会骑马
Oh, no. I really... I don't know how.

754
01:00:50,030 --> 01:00:54,060
我可以教你  难道你有更好的安排吗
Well, I can teach you. Or have you something better to be doing?

755
01:00:54,820 --> 01:00:56,650
-我该怎么...  -我数到三  把腿跨过去
- How do I... - On three, swing your leg over.

756
01:00:56,650 --> 01:00:57,680
-准备好了吗  -你是要...
- Ready? - Do you...

757
01:00:58,280 --> 01:00:59,640
一  二  三
One, two, three.

758
01:01:01,490 --> 01:01:04,470
能帮我蹬一下吗  好了
Can you give me a stirrup? All right.

759
01:01:04,780 --> 01:01:05,350
你是要...
Are you...

760
01:01:07,900 --> 01:01:09,020
我们不会骑得太快的
We won't go too fast.

761
01:01:15,780 --> 01:01:16,470
就是这样
That's it.

762
01:01:19,990 --> 01:01:20,770
你感觉怎么样
How do you feel?

763
01:01:24,360 --> 01:01:26,970
-好了  现在你拿着缰绳  -好的
- Right, now you take the reins. - Oh, all right.

764
01:01:27,650 --> 01:01:29,180
-轻轻拉着  -好的
- Be nice and loose. - Yeah.

765
01:01:29,320 --> 01:01:31,940
放低一点  对了
And low. That's it.

766
01:01:31,950 --> 01:01:33,520
-明白了  -放在你的大腿上
- Got it. - Right here on your lap.

767
01:01:34,780 --> 01:01:37,850
切记  要把腿夹紧
Now, very important. Squeeze the thighs.

768
01:01:38,610 --> 01:01:40,020
让马知道你在它背上
Let the beast know you're there.

769
01:01:41,700 --> 01:01:43,390
你今晚可能会全身酸痛
You're gonna be wickedly sore this evening.

770
01:01:44,240 --> 01:01:45,850
现在跟着我一起动  准备好了吗
Now just move with me. Ready?

771
01:01:46,700 --> 01:01:47,310
好的
All right.

772
01:01:50,700 --> 01:01:52,100
亲爱的  我能问你点事吗
Darling, may I ask you something?

773
01:01:53,030 --> 01:01:55,770
迈克斯跟你说过那次事故吗
Has Max ever talked to you about the accident?

774
01:01:58,750 --> 01:02:01,670
他没提过吕蓓卡那天去过伦敦吗
And he never mentioned Rebecca's trip to London that day?

775
01:02:02,790 --> 01:02:03,860
没有
No.

776
01:02:05,280 --> 01:02:07,030
他对这件事只字不提
No, he won't speak of it at all.

777
01:02:09,990 --> 01:02:12,810
这么说你不知道他有没有见过她
So, you don't know if he saw her

778
01:02:13,240 --> 01:02:15,270
就在她那晚回来
when she got back that night,

779
01:02:16,100 --> 01:02:17,820
准备出海之前
before she took the boat out?

780
01:02:18,680 --> 01:02:19,720
不知道
No.

781
01:02:25,920 --> 01:02:28,440
她想告诉我一些事
There's something she wanted to tell me.

782
01:02:29,310 --> 01:02:31,260
很重要的事
Something very important.

783
01:02:34,820 --> 01:02:37,150
不知道到底是什么事...
And not knowing what it was...

784
01:02:39,880 --> 01:02:41,930
真的让我难以承受
That's really been a hard thing.

785
01:02:46,200 --> 01:02:48,970
我破坏了自己玩世不恭的形象  对吗
I'm not doing my roguish image any good, am I?

786
01:02:51,590 --> 01:02:53,920
你应该再来一次  问问迈克西姆
You should come back and ask Maxim.

787
01:02:53,970 --> 01:02:55,350
我会的
Well, I would.

788
01:02:58,110 --> 01:03:01,090
但其实我被禁止来这里
But I'm afraid I'm a little bit banned from visiting.

789
01:03:01,910 --> 01:03:05,270
实际上  你最好不要提我今天来过
In fact, it's best if you don't mention my being here at all today.

790
01:03:05,340 --> 01:03:08,280
我还以为你们是朋友
I... I thought you were friends.

791
01:03:08,530 --> 01:03:09,990
算不上
Not really, no.

792
01:03:13,710 --> 01:03:17,550
我不希望我们俩中的任何一个
And I would hate for either one of us

793
01:03:17,760 --> 01:03:20,760
经受到他有名的暴脾气
to be on the receiving end of that famous temper of his.

794
01:03:20,760 --> 01:03:22,870
我不知道你在说什么
I don't know what you're talking about.

795
01:03:24,990 --> 01:03:27,170
你们还没在一起生活多久
Well, it is still early days.

796
01:03:32,170 --> 01:03:35,650
我最好别让丹尼等了  你知道她是什么样的
Well, I better not keep Danny waiting. You know how she is.

797
01:04:06,490 --> 01:04:08,230
你为什么邀请了他
Why did you invite him?

798
01:04:10,050 --> 01:04:11,500
杰克·费弗尔
Jack Favell.

799
01:04:12,070 --> 01:04:13,730
你邀请他来喝茶
You asked him for tea,

800
01:04:14,090 --> 01:04:17,800
你明知道老爷不准他来
knowing full well Mr. de Winter has banned him from the property.

801
01:04:18,350 --> 01:04:20,600
你一定是弄错了  夫人
There must be some mistake, madam.

802
01:04:21,120 --> 01:04:24,430
我已经有一年多没见过费弗尔先生了
I haven't seen Mr. Favell for over a year.

803
01:04:55,600 --> 01:04:56,780
你好  弗里思
Hello, Frith.

804
01:04:56,900 --> 01:05:01,180
你好  老爷  费弗尔先生不请自来过
Hello, sir. Mr. Favell has made an unannounced visit.

805
01:05:05,310 --> 01:05:07,110
我不管她对弗里思说了什么
I don't care what she told Frith!

806
01:05:07,110 --> 01:05:10,200
费弗尔先生跟我说是她邀请他来这儿的
Mr. Favell told me that she invited him here.

807
01:05:10,200 --> 01:05:12,410
难道是丹弗斯太太逼你
Well, Mrs. Danvers, I suppose she forced you

808
01:05:12,410 --> 01:05:13,840
和他一起骑马的吗
to go riding with him, did she?

809
01:05:13,840 --> 01:05:15,240
不  我可以解释
No, I can explain!

810
01:05:15,240 --> 01:05:18,160
-解释什么  -我本来打算告诉你的  真的
- Explain what? - I was going to tell you, I was.

811
01:05:18,350 --> 01:05:22,340
想告诉我你是怎么把他拉到船库里的
Want to tell me how you dragged him down to the boathouse?

812
01:05:23,210 --> 01:05:26,440
怎么跟他展示你漂亮的新睡衣吗
Parade your fancy new night clothes for him?

813
01:05:26,440 --> 01:05:28,510
你怎么能这么想
How could you even think that?

814
01:05:28,510 --> 01:05:31,280
如果我知道你会生气
I'd never have let him on the property

815
01:05:31,280 --> 01:05:33,810
我绝不会让他进入庄园  迈克西姆
if I'd known it would upset you, Maxim.

816
01:05:34,090 --> 01:05:37,140
拜托  我爱你
Please. I love you.

817
01:05:40,610 --> 01:05:41,820
真的吗
Oh, do you?

818
01:05:42,630 --> 01:05:44,310
是丹弗斯太太邀请他过来的
Mrs. Danvers invited him here.

819
01:05:44,320 --> 01:05:47,580
我不想再听到你说丹弗斯了
I don't wanna hear another word about Danvers!

820
01:06:11,560 --> 01:06:12,740
请进
Come in.

821
01:06:18,440 --> 01:06:19,800
丹弗斯太太
Mrs. Danvers.

822
01:06:20,490 --> 01:06:22,410
我是来辞退你的
I've come to give you your notice.

823
01:06:25,730 --> 01:06:27,880
老爷同意了吗
Has Mr. de Winter agreed to this?

824
01:06:27,880 --> 01:06:29,670
这是我的决定
The decision is mine.

825
01:06:35,660 --> 01:06:37,030
其实
You see...

826
01:06:38,580 --> 01:06:41,700
我从吕蓓卡小时候就开始照顾她了
I looked after Rebecca when she was a little girl.

827
01:06:42,540 --> 01:06:45,610
她结婚之后  我们一起来到了这里
We came here together when she was first married.

828
01:06:48,530 --> 01:06:50,250
我是她的朋友
I was her friend.

829
01:06:52,310 --> 01:06:54,600
是可以分享她秘密的人
Someone to share her secrets.

830
01:06:56,900 --> 01:06:59,090
这种关系是无法打破的
Bond like that can't be broke.

831
01:06:59,670 --> 01:07:02,790
也无法取代  我不该期望和您建立这种关系
Can't be replaced. I was wrong to expect that from you.

832
01:07:07,540 --> 01:07:09,720
你会找到另一个庄园
Well, you'll find another house.

833
01:07:10,580 --> 01:07:11,680
不
No.

834
01:07:14,010 --> 01:07:15,240
我们女人
We women,

835
01:07:15,740 --> 01:07:19,740
要么结婚  要么去当仆人
we can either marry or go into service,

836
01:07:20,900 --> 01:07:22,670
我太老了  这两种选择都不合适
and I'm too old for either.

837
01:07:23,780 --> 01:07:26,160
我们会确保你衣食无忧
Well, we'll make sure that you're provided for.

838
01:07:26,160 --> 01:07:28,800
这和钱无关  只是...
Oh, it's not about money. It's...

839
01:07:29,350 --> 01:07:33,450
这对我来说不是工作  吕蓓卡是我的人生
This wasn't a job for me. Rebecca was my life.

840
01:07:36,590 --> 01:07:37,800
是的
Yes.

841
01:07:38,100 --> 01:07:40,210
如果我让您失望了  我很抱歉
I'm sorry if I failed you.

842
01:07:40,210 --> 01:07:41,600
这不是我的本意
I didn't mean to let you down.

843
01:07:41,600 --> 01:07:45,260
只是您看上去一心想要我行我素
It was just you seemed so set on doing things your own way.

844
01:07:46,110 --> 01:07:48,500
不  这一切对我来说都很陌生
No. This is all very new to me.

845
01:07:48,800 --> 01:07:50,830
这个庄园  还有佣人...
The house, the staff...

846
01:07:51,530 --> 01:07:52,100
我只是...
I just...

847
01:07:52,100 --> 01:07:57,080
我觉得德温特先生也希望你能帮我
I think that Mr. de Winter hoped that you'd help me.

848
01:07:58,480 --> 01:08:00,670
您并没有向我寻求帮助
You didn't ask for my help.

849
01:08:07,130 --> 01:08:08,270
那么
Well...

850
01:08:10,910 --> 01:08:12,800
如果我现在请求你的帮助呢
what if I asked for it now?

851
01:08:47,660 --> 01:08:48,940
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

852
01:08:50,640 --> 01:08:52,110
我是个蠢货
I was an idiot.

853
01:08:52,800 --> 01:08:54,360
那不是你的错
It's not your fault.

854
01:08:56,200 --> 01:08:57,910
我知道不是
I know it wasn't.

855
01:09:08,540 --> 01:09:09,830
我真的很抱歉
I'm so sorry.

856
01:09:24,800 --> 01:09:26,250
{\an8}曼陀丽舞会

857
01:09:27,740 --> 01:09:30,010

01:09:27,860 --> 01:09:29,010

01:09:32,330 --> 01:09:34,140
{\an8}开胃菜  牡蛎

860
01:09:33,820 --> 01:09:37,530
很好  夫人  我马上去印出来
Very good, madam. Perfect. I'll have them printed at once.

861
01:09:37,810 --> 01:09:40,420
如果您希望伦敦的沃斯店定制您的服装
Oh, and we must let Voce in London know before Friday

862
01:09:40,420 --> 01:09:42,510
我们必须在周五之前通知他们
if you wish them to make your costume.

863
01:09:42,510 --> 01:09:46,060
好的  恐怕我还没有做好决定
Yes. I'm afraid I'm drawing a bit of a blank there.

864
01:09:47,880 --> 01:09:51,920
您是舞会上最重要的女士
Well, you'll be the most important lady at the ball.

865
01:09:51,920 --> 01:09:55,730
-选择服装的时候请谨记这一点  -好的
- So, choose something with that in mind. - Yes.

866
01:09:56,490 --> 01:09:58,460
自信点
Oh, be confident.

867
01:09:58,880 --> 01:10:01,400
让他们看看您的自然美
Let them see your natural beauty.

868
01:10:04,570 --> 01:10:05,780
夫人
Madam?

869
01:10:06,670 --> 01:10:08,960
如果我这么说不会太冒昧的话...
If it's not too forward of me...

870
01:10:09,960 --> 01:10:14,110
丹弗斯太太说  您还没有决定要穿什么
Mrs. Danvers said you'd not picked out what to wear yet, and...

871
01:10:14,980 --> 01:10:17,270
不知道您想不想听听我的建议
I wondered if you'd want an idea.

872
01:10:18,080 --> 01:10:21,770
好的  当然  什么建议都可以  坐吧
Yes, please, anything. Sit down.

873
01:10:23,560 --> 01:10:27,150
画廊里的那些旧画作
Just... the old paintings in the gallery.

874
01:10:27,750 --> 01:10:31,260
我一直认为画里的服装会是最漂亮的舞会礼服
I always thought they'd make the most beautiful costume.

875
01:10:31,580 --> 01:10:34,330
特别是身穿红裙的那位女士
Especially the lady in the red dress.

876
01:10:40,140 --> 01:10:41,840
很明智的选择
Brilliant choice.

877
01:10:42,430 --> 01:10:43,840
克拉丽斯和我说了
Clarice informed me.

878
01:10:43,840 --> 01:10:48,610
请容许我说  这件裙子配得上庄园的女主人
And if I may say so, one worthy of the lady of this house.

879
01:10:53,560 --> 01:10:55,490
我道歉
I do apologize.

- What? Hands off! Don't! - Can't I just see?

892
01:12:02,040 --> 01:12:04,250
不不不  你会毁了惊喜的
No, no, no, no, no, you'll ruin the surprise.

893
01:12:04,250 --> 01:12:06,230
你知道我不喜欢惊喜
You know I don't like surprises.

894
01:12:06,250 --> 01:12:09,460
你肯定会喜欢这个惊喜
Well, you'll like this one.

895
01:12:10,080 --> 01:12:11,640
你会认不出我的
You won't recognize me.

896
01:12:15,590 --> 01:12:17,070
我真为你自豪
I'm so proud of you.

897
01:12:21,830 --> 01:12:24,380
别让我一个人在下面等太久
Now, don't you leave me down there too long.

898

那就快出去吧  这样我才能准备
Then get out so I can get ready.

Don't be silly. It's all right, I won't tell anyone.

902
01:13:02,900 --> 01:13:05,010
不行  走开  你不能进来
No, no, no, no, go away! You can't come in!

903
01:13:05,070 --> 01:13:07,550
夫人  客人们到了
The guests are arriving, ma'am.

904

906
01:13:15,030 --> 01:13:16,260

Very good.

907
01:13:18,790 --> 01:13:21,480
-你一个人躲在这里干什么  -没什么
- What are you doing lurking over here? - Nothing.

908
01:13:21,480 --> 01:13:24,190
-这就像以前一样  不是吗  -挺好的
- It's just like old times, isn't it? - Mmm, it's good.

909
01:13:24,190 --> 01:13:25,420
你的服装呢
Where's your outfit?

910
01:13:25,430 --> 01:13:27,460
-这就是我的服装  贾尔斯  -很棒
- This is my outfit, Giles. - It's marvelous.

911
01:13:27,460 --> 01:13:29,240
真热闹  香槟啊
Palaver! Oh, champagne.

912
01:13:29,460 --> 01:13:32,040
-和往常一样迟到了  -你这次是什么理由
- Late as usual. - So, what's your excuse?

913
01:13:33,140 --> 01:13:34,770
有棵树倒下来挡着车道了  得把树移走
Tree down across the drive. Had to get it moved.

914
01:13:34,770 --> 01:13:36,410
不  我是说这身衣服
No, no, for this.

915
01:13:37,410 --> 01:13:39,580
但我每年都穿这身衣服  好吗
But I wear it every year, mate.

916
01:13:53,720 --> 01:13:56,390
好了  她终于来了
All right. Finally. Hey, here she comes.

917
01:14:20,810 --> 01:14:22,630
德温特先生  你好吗
How do you do, Mr. de Winter?

918
01:14:36,070 --> 01:14:38,050
这是在戏弄我吗
Is this some kind of joke?

919
01:14:39,530 --> 01:14:42,830
当然不是  是照着那幅画  我想着...
Of course not. It's the painting. I thought...

920
01:14:42,830 --> 01:14:44,100
去换衣服
Go and change.

921
01:14:46,370 --> 01:14:47,940
怎么了  我做错...
What is it? What have I...

922
01:14:47,940 --> 01:14:51,440
现在就去换衣服
Go and change now.

923
01:14:53,390 --> 01:14:54,080
我不明白
I don't understand.

924
01:14:54,090 --> 01:14:56,580
-我做错了什么  -我叫你现在就去
- What have I done wrong? - I said now!

925
01:15:10,120 --> 01:15:13,910
很抱歉  夫人  我不知道会这样
I'm sorry. Please, madam, I never knew.

926
01:15:13,910 --> 01:15:16,170
这是丹弗斯太太的主意
It was Mrs. Danvers' idea.

927
01:15:24,730 --> 01:15:27,580
吕蓓卡以前穿过这件裙子  对吗
Rebecca wore this before, didn't she?

928
01:15:27,580 --> 01:15:30,880
丹弗斯太太说他肯定会很开心...
Mrs. Danvers said he'd be so pleased and

929
01:15:31,570 --> 01:15:33,850
你也会很开心
you'd be so pleased.

930
01:15:40,790 --> 01:15:42,100
拿着
Hold that.

931
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:47,430
-真是太糟糕了  -叫人毛骨悚然  不是吗
- That's most unfortunate. - It was uncanny, wasn't it?

932
01:15:54,900 --> 01:15:58,790
-不  我做不到  -胡说  亲爱的  你必须这么做
- No, I can't. - Oh, bosh! Darling, you have to.

933
01:15:59,220 --> 01:16:00,360
不
No.

934
01:16:01,440 --> 01:16:03,600
事情没有那么糟
It's not as bad as all that.

935
01:16:04,290 --> 01:16:06,160
你不明白  我做不到
You don't understand, I can't.

936
01:16:06,840 --> 01:16:08,390
都这样了  我还怎么下楼
Not after this. Not after what I've done.

937
01:16:08,390 --> 01:16:10,460
你怎么会想得到
How were you to know?

938
01:16:10,570 --> 01:16:11,950
去洗洗脸
Now, wash your face,

939
01:16:11,950 --> 01:16:14,650
我去帮你找衣服穿  好吗
and I'll find you something to wear, all right?

940
01:16:15,450 --> 01:16:16,650
我应该想到的
I should've known.

941
01:16:17,220 --> 01:16:19,730
-我就不该穿这件裙子  -振作点
- I should never have worn it. - Pull yourself together.

942
01:16:20,320 --> 01:16:22,820
你可以坐在这里自责一整晚
You can sit up here all night feeling sorry for yourself,

943
01:16:22,820 --> 01:16:24,160
或者可以和我一起下楼
or you can come downstairs with me

944
01:16:24,160 --> 01:16:26,830
一笑置之  怎么样
and have a good old laugh about it, hmm?

945
01:16:33,750 --> 01:16:35,280
他的表情...
His face...

946
01:16:37,290 --> 01:16:40,490
他绝不会这么对她说话
He wouldn't have spoken like that to her.

947
01:16:41,610 --> 01:16:43,680
你们是迥然不同的人
You're very different people,

948
01:16:44,030 --> 01:16:46,280
这没什么好羞耻的
and that's nothing to be ashamed of.

949
01:16:48,060 --> 01:16:49,280
-好的  -来
- Okay. - Come on.

950
01:16:49,280 --> 01:16:52,310
你现在不在欧洲了  沉着点
You're not on the continent now. Let's have a stiff upper lip.

951
01:16:52,310 --> 01:16:54,550
-怎么样  -好的
- What? - Oh, yes.

952
01:16:55,640 --> 01:16:56,750
这件应该可以
This'll do.

953
01:16:59,840 --> 01:17:01,160
我会没事的
I'll be all right.

954
01:17:02,100 --> 01:17:03,260
你做得很好
Good show.

955
01:17:05,220 --> 01:17:06,710
-楼下见  -好的
- I'll see you downstairs. - Yes.

956
01:17:06,710 --> 01:17:08,300
-好吗  -好的
- Yes? - Yes.

957
01:17:40,910 --> 01:17:42,430
没有什么能让我感到高兴...
Nothing would make me happy...

958
01:17:44,110 --> 01:17:47,150
克罗恩勋爵  克罗恩夫人  这位是德温特夫人
Lord Crowan, Lady Crowan, may I present Mrs. de Winter.

959
01:17:47,150 --> 01:17:50,680
真可惜  没能看见你穿礼裙的样子
Oh, rotten luck about your frock not turning up.

960
01:17:50,680 --> 01:17:53,300
-是啊  -没关系  你看上去很漂亮
- Yes. - Oh, never mind. You look lovely,

961
01:17:53,300 --> 01:17:56,210
而且比我这身滑稽的服装要舒服多了
and far more comfortable than I am in this ridiculous getup.

962
01:17:56,210 --> 01:17:59,460
别犯傻了  亲爱的  你看上去美极了
Oh, don't be silly, darling. You look divine.

963
01:18:00,370 --> 01:18:02,700
-迈克西姆  我...  -这主意就是个错误
- Maxim, I... - This whole idea was a mistake.

964
01:18:02,700 --> 01:18:04,870
我就不该带你回来
I should never have brought you back here.

965
01:19:02,990 --> 01:19:07,730
士兵和水手从战场上回来了
There are sailors and soldiers returned from the war.

966
01:19:07,730 --> 01:19:09,910
小姐  这里不是你待的地方
This ain't no place for you, miss.

967
01:19:09,910 --> 01:19:14,910
他们勇敢地为祖国而战
Who bravely have fought in their country's cause.

968
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:17,910
结果回到家却饥肠辘辘
To come home, to be starved,

969
01:19:17,910 --> 01:19:20,990
还是待在以前的地方更好...
best stayed where they was...

970
01:20:03,990 --> 01:20:07,710
吕蓓卡  吕蓓卡  吕蓓卡  吕蓓卡
Rebecca! Rebecca! Rebecca! Rebecca!

971
01:20:07,710 --> 01:20:11,690
吕蓓卡  吕蓓卡  吕蓓卡  吕蓓卡
Rebecca! Rebecca! Rebecca! Rebecca!

972
01:20:11,700 --> 01:20:15,680
吕蓓卡  吕蓓卡  吕蓓卡  吕蓓卡
Rebecca! Rebecca! Rebecca! Rebecca!

973
01:20:15,680 --> 01:20:17,990
吕蓓卡  吕蓓卡
Rebecca! Rebecca!

974
01:20:39,350 --> 01:20:40,780
迈克西姆
Maxim?

975
01:20:59,650 --> 01:21:01,100
好了  现在你明白了吗
There, do you see now?

976
01:21:03,540 --> 01:21:04,950
你永远无法取代她
You'll never replace her.

977
01:21:04,950 --> 01:21:07,380
-你无法取代她  -是你干的
- You can't replace her. - You did this.

978
01:21:09,090 --> 01:21:12,490
-你从一开始就针对我  -不
- You've been against me from the start. - No.

979
01:21:12,490 --> 01:21:16,190
-我是在帮你  -你骗了我  你策划了一切
- I was helping you. - You tricked me. You planned this.

980
01:21:16,190 --> 01:21:19,330
你和我都清楚  你什么也不是
You and I both know you are nothing.

981
01:21:19,330 --> 01:21:21,440
你一文不值
You're worthless.

982
01:21:21,440 --> 01:21:25,380
你配不上他  配不上这栋大宅
Not worthy of him and not worthy of this house.

983
01:21:25,790 --> 01:21:27,600
他绝不会爱你
He'll never love you.

984
01:21:28,550 --> 01:21:30,040
他为什么要爱你呢
And why should he?

985
01:21:31,440 --> 01:21:32,340
他爱过
He did.

986
01:21:32,340 --> 01:21:35,940
不  他无法爱上你  因为你不是她
No, he can't love you because you're not her.

987
01:21:37,020 --> 01:21:38,330
你真该见见她
You should've seen her.

988
01:21:38,340 --> 01:21:42,670
在16岁时  她骑着父亲的马  那马野得很
At 16 years old, on her father's horse, a huge brute,

989
01:21:42,670 --> 01:21:44,990
但她驯服了它
but she mastered him.

990
01:21:45,040 --> 01:21:47,230
等她调教完马后
By the time she finished with him,

991
01:21:47,230 --> 01:21:50,300
它已经顺服得像羊羔一般
he was nothing but froth and blood.

992
01:21:51,780 --> 01:21:54,890
我让她失望了  由得你在这里住了这么久
I've let her down, allowing you here for so long.

993
01:21:55,870 --> 01:21:57,540
她无法容忍的
She won't stand for it.

994
01:21:57,540 --> 01:21:59,970
"我们地狱见  丹尼  我们地狱见"
"I'll see you in hell, Danny! I'll see you in hell first!"

995
01:21:59,970 --> 01:22:03,750
但吕蓓卡死了  她已经死了
But Rebecca's dead! She's dead!

996
01:22:03,800 --> 01:22:05,680
他会离开你  他会和你离婚
He'll leave you, he'll divorce you.

997
01:22:06,350 --> 01:22:07,860
然后你要怎么办
And then what'll you do?

998
01:22:08,150 --> 01:22:09,330
我走就是了
I'll just go.

999
01:22:09,600 --> 01:22:12,570
走  你要去哪儿
You'll go? Go where?

1000
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:15,190
你现在没法再婚了
You can't remarry now.

1001
01:22:15,560 --> 01:22:18,030
你肯定也没法管理一栋宅子
You certainly can't look after a house.

1002
01:22:18,400 --> 01:22:21,150
你没有家庭支持你
You don't have any family to support you.

1003
01:22:26,380 --> 01:22:27,810
没关系
It's all right.

1004
01:22:28,690 --> 01:22:32,090
我知道你的感受  其实没那么糟
I know how you feel. It's not as bad as all that.

1005
01:22:33,560 --> 01:22:35,150
很快就会结束
It'll be very quick.

1006
01:22:36,480 --> 01:22:40,720
别害怕  这是为了大家好
Don't be scared. It's all for the best.

1007
01:22:42,020 --> 01:22:44,390
没人希望你在这里
No one wants you here.

1008
01:22:49,180 --> 01:22:51,240
弗里思  罗伯特  快来
Frith! Robert! Come quickly.

1009
01:22:51,270 --> 01:22:53,420
一艘拖网渔船搁浅了  叫海岸警卫队来
A trawler's run aground. Get the coast guard.

1010
01:22:53,420 --> 01:22:55,620
-他们正赶来  老爷  -迈克西姆
- They're on the way, sir. - Maxim.

1011
01:23:18,660 --> 01:23:21,090
他在那里干什么
What's he doin' down there?

1012
01:23:25,210 --> 01:23:26,950
丹尼尔  等我
Daniel, wait for me.

1013
01:23:28,340 --> 01:23:31,900
快点  用点力  就这样
Move on, now. Get up, now. That's it.

1014
01:23:31,900 --> 01:23:33,690
后退  让一让
Stand back! Coming forward!

1015
01:23:33,700 --> 01:23:35,050
潜水员下海了
Diver's down there.

1016
01:23:35,560 --> 01:23:37,550
肯定是要捞值钱的东西
Must've been something valuable.

1017
01:23:37,570 --> 01:23:38,940
是为了那艘拖网渔船
That's for the trawler.

1018
01:23:39,130 --> 01:23:41,180
他们还发现了别的东西
They found somethin' else down there.

1019
01:23:45,580 --> 01:23:48,610
就这样  好样的
That's it! Good lad!

1020
01:23:58,870 --> 01:24:00,860
{\an8}"我归来"号

1021
01:24:00,860 --> 01:24:02,680
{\an8}"我归来"号

1022
01:24:13,670 --> 01:24:16,380
我什么都没说  对吧
I never said nothing. Did I?

1023
01:24:17,310 --> 01:24:19,100
她现在不会回来了
She'll not come back now.

1024
01:24:19,100 --> 01:24:22,110
鱼肯定已经把她啃食完了  对吧
The fishes will have devoured her by now, ain't they?

1025
01:24:23,690 --> 01:24:24,870
弗兰克
Frank.

1026
01:24:26,700 --> 01:24:28,340
你不该来这里
You really shouldn't be here.

1027
01:24:36,690 --> 01:24:39,960
别在那等了  快点  都走吧  后退
Don't wait there. Come on. Everybody move. Stand back.

1028
01:24:48,400 --> 01:24:52,190
她的船里有一具尸体  跟她的发色相同
The body was found in her boat. The same color hair.

1029
01:24:52,930 --> 01:24:54,730
还有她结婚戒指上的镌刻
And the engravings on her wedding ring.

1030
01:24:54,740 --> 01:24:56,420
毫无疑问就是她
There's no doubt it's her.

1031
01:24:56,420 --> 01:24:58,460
别说傻话了
Don't be an imbecile.

1032
01:24:58,960 --> 01:25:02,060
我想这其中肯定有个合理的解释  对吧
I'm sure there's a perfectly logical explanation, hmm?

1033
01:25:02,060 --> 01:25:03,780
你不觉得这很奇怪吗
You don't think it's odd?

1034
01:25:03,860 --> 01:25:04,900
你弟弟认领
That your brother identified

1035
01:25:04,900 --> 01:25:07,040
并埋葬了陌生人的尸体  当作自己的妻子
and buried the body of a stranger as his wife?

1036
01:25:07,040 --> 01:25:09,260
不  贾尔斯  我不觉得奇怪
No, Giles, I don't.

1037
01:25:09,330 --> 01:25:12,330
如果你那么关心  怎么不自己去问迈克西姆呢
If you're so concerned, why don't you go and ask Maxim yourself.

1038
01:25:12,330 --> 01:25:15,980
我倒是想  但已经好几小时没人看见他了
I would, but no one's seen him for hours. I mean...

1039
01:25:17,010 --> 01:25:20,580
怎么回事  为什么警察在询问他
What's happened? Why were the police questioning him?

1040
01:25:22,940 --> 01:25:26,760
不  他没回过家  他们什么时候放了他
No. He's not been home. Why? When did they release him?

1041
01:25:27,440 --> 01:25:29,420
拜托  你见到他后务必联系我
...please, do let me know when you see him.

1042
01:25:29,420 --> 01:25:33,660
没问题  弗兰克  谢谢
Yes, of course, Frank. Thank you.

1043
01:25:33,680 --> 01:25:35,970
别担心  好好照顾自己
Don't worry. Take care of yourself.

1044
01:26:24,890 --> 01:26:27,400
都结束了  她赢了
It's over. She's won.

1045
01:26:29,310 --> 01:26:30,530
谁赢了
Who's won?

1046
01:26:32,680 --> 01:26:33,920
吕蓓卡
Rebecca.

1047
01:26:38,540 --> 01:26:40,780
如果他们找到的是她的尸体
If that's her body they found,

1048
01:26:41,600 --> 01:26:43,270
那你之前埋葬的人是谁
who is it you buried?

1049
01:26:44,450 --> 01:26:45,590
我不知道
I don't know.

1050
01:26:46,200 --> 01:26:47,480
迈克西姆
Maxim.

1051
01:26:49,600 --> 01:26:50,910
告诉我真相
The truth.

1052
01:26:51,950 --> 01:26:54,760
我不知道  我发誓
I don't know. I swear it.

1053
01:26:56,930 --> 01:26:58,370
她怎么淹死的
How did she drown?

1054
01:26:59,340 --> 01:27:00,510
她没有
She didn't.

1055
01:27:01,240 --> 01:27:02,510
别骗我
Don't lie to me.

1056
01:27:03,160 --> 01:27:05,010
她没有淹死
She didn't drown.

1057
01:27:05,970 --> 01:27:07,650
她那时已经死了
She was already dead.

1058
01:27:08,450 --> 01:27:10,240
她的船被动了手脚
Her boat was damaged.

1059
01:27:10,870 --> 01:27:12,360
是我干的
I damaged it.

1060
01:27:13,880 --> 01:27:15,310
我故意的
Deliberately.

1061
01:27:18,980 --> 01:27:20,400
迈克西姆
Oh, Maxim.

1062
01:27:21,180 --> 01:27:22,720
你不了解她
You didn't know her.

1063
01:27:23,630 --> 01:27:25,120
没人了解
Nobody did.

1064
01:27:28,120 --> 01:27:30,740
她在我们度蜜月时告诉我今后的生活会如何
She told me on our honeymoon how it would be.

1065
01:27:31,060 --> 01:27:33,640
她会保留她在伦敦的公寓
How she would keep her flat in London.

1066
01:27:34,010 --> 01:27:37,690
和一个又一个男人鬼混  连她的表哥也不放过
Her parade of men. Even her own cousin.

1067
01:27:38,280 --> 01:27:39,720
拜托  迈克西姆
Please, Maxim!

1068
01:27:40,720 --> 01:27:44,180
她很享受这样  扮演这个角色
She relished it. Playing the part.

1069
01:27:44,180 --> 01:27:48,370
所谓的完美妻子  她知道我绝不会和她离婚
The perfect wife, knowing that I would never divorce her.

1070
01:27:48,370 --> 01:27:49,840
因为你爱她
'Cause you loved her.

1071
01:27:52,850 --> 01:27:55,480
我恨她
I hated her.

1072
01:27:57,990 --> 01:27:59,880
恨她的残酷
Hated her cruelty.

1073
01:28:01,260 --> 01:28:03,410
恨我的懦弱
I hated my cowardice.

1074
01:28:04,470 --> 01:28:06,510
我知道自己不会和她离婚
Knowing that I wouldn't divorce her.

1075
01:28:07,230 --> 01:28:09,650
我知道自己绝不能玷污家名
Knowing I could never do that to our name.

1076
01:28:16,620 --> 01:28:18,260
她是怎么死的
How did she die?

1077
01:28:18,540 --> 01:28:19,820
她从伦敦回来后
When she came back from London,

1078
01:28:19,820 --> 01:28:23,140
说正等着费弗尔来
she told me she was expecting a visit from Favell.

1079
01:28:23,900 --> 01:28:25,580
我到这里时  就她一个人在
When I got here, she was alone.

1080
01:28:25,630 --> 01:28:27,700
她看起来不同寻常  脸色苍白
She looked different. She was pale.

1081
01:28:28,630 --> 01:28:30,500
她去伦敦看医生了
She'd seen a doctor in London.

1082
01:28:30,640 --> 01:28:33,670
她说  "假设我怀了孩子  迈克斯
She said, "Imagine if I had a child, Max.

1083
01:28:33,670 --> 01:28:36,520
你永远无法证明那不是你的骨肉"
You could never prove it wasn't yours."

1084
01:28:36,520 --> 01:28:39,620
她夺走了我的尊严还不够
See, it wasn't enough for her to take my pride.

1085
01:28:40,330 --> 01:28:44,260
她还想夺走我的名字  我的家  我的一切
She wanted to take my name, my home, everything.

1086
01:28:44,990 --> 01:28:48,860
然后她说  "来啊  迈克斯  动手吧"
And she said, "Go on, Max, do it."

1087
01:28:49,310 --> 01:28:52,190
"你只需要扣下扳机  之后你就自由了"
"All you have to do is pull the trigger and you'll be free."

1088
01:28:54,650 --> 01:28:55,870
求你了
Please.

1089
01:29:19,390 --> 01:29:20,960
子弹径直穿过了她的身体
Bullet went straight through her.

1090
01:29:21,890 --> 01:29:24,500
但她没有马上倒下  只是站在原地
She didn't fall right away. She just stood there.

1091
01:29:24,920 --> 01:29:26,660
无比平静
So calm.

1092
01:29:27,760 --> 01:29:29,410
像释怀了一般
Almost relieved.

1093
01:29:32,350 --> 01:29:33,810
然后她就死了
And then she was gone.

1094
01:29:37,060 --> 01:29:39,840
一直以来我以为你还爱着吕蓓卡
All this time I thought you still loved Rebecca.

1095
01:30:04,920 --> 01:30:06,480
你为什么不告诉我
Why didn't you tell me?

1096
01:30:14,020 --> 01:30:15,300
我说不出口
I couldn't.

1097
01:30:18,290 --> 01:30:20,890
我太害怕会失去你
I was so afraid I'd have lost you.

1098
01:30:23,820 --> 01:30:26,190
去报警吧  告诉他们一切
Go to the police, tell them everything.

1099
01:30:26,740 --> 01:30:30,780
你什么都不知道  你不会受牵连
You didn't know. Nothing'll happen to you.

1100
01:30:34,030 --> 01:30:36,590
如果你不想再和我扯上关系  我也能理解
I understand if you want nothing more to do with me.

1101
01:30:38,220 --> 01:30:39,510
那是你的选择
That's your choice.

1102
01:30:43,200 --> 01:30:45,040
你弄错了
You made a mistake...

1103
01:30:46,680 --> 01:30:48,600
认错了尸体
identifying the body.

1104
01:30:49,120 --> 01:30:51,330
那都是因为你太悲痛受创
It was the grief, the trauma.

1105
01:30:52,690 --> 01:30:55,240
除了我们没人知道真相  其他人永远不会知道
Nobody knows but us. Nobody will ever know.

1106
01:30:57,770 --> 01:30:59,830
她没有赢  迈克西姆
No, she hasn't won, Maxim.

1107
01:31:00,110 --> 01:31:01,440
她没有赢
She hasn't won.

1108
01:31:02,080 --> 01:31:03,520
我们不会让她赢
We won't let her.

1109
01:31:25,030 --> 01:31:26,510
你不用和他们说什么
You don't have to speak to them.

1110
01:31:26,510 --> 01:31:29,580
全体起立  尊敬的詹姆斯·克劳奇先生来了
All stand for the Right Honorable James Crouch.

1111
01:31:34,270 --> 01:31:34,790
后退
Stand back.

1112
01:31:34,790 --> 01:31:37,680
肃静  大家安静
Order! Settle down.

1113
01:31:37,780 --> 01:31:39,960
这是...  坐下  先生
This is the... Sit down, sir.

1114
01:31:39,960 --> 01:31:41,870
本次审理是为调查
This is the coroner's inquest

1115
01:31:41,880 --> 01:31:45,240
吕蓓卡·德温特的死因
into the discovery of the body of Rebecca de Winter.

1116
01:31:45,610 --> 01:31:48,170
此案目前不是刑事诉讼
This is not currently a criminal proceeding.

1117
01:31:48,170 --> 01:31:52,090
我们只是来查明德温特夫人是怎么死的
We are here only to ascertain how Mrs. de Winter died.

1118
01:31:52,090 --> 01:31:53,340
本庭现在听取
The court will now hear

1119
01:31:53,340 --> 01:31:56,330
克里斯警局韦尔奇警长的证词
from Detective Welch of the Kerrith police.

1120
01:31:56,480 --> 01:31:57,950
韦尔奇警长
Detective Welch.

1121
01:31:59,650 --> 01:32:03,420
德温特先生去年指认的那具尸体...
The body Mr. de Winter identified last year...

1122
01:32:04,140 --> 01:32:05,760
并不是他妻子的
was not his wife.

1123
01:32:06,070 --> 01:32:08,600
事实上  吕蓓卡·德温特的尸体
In fact, Rebecca de Winter's body

1124
01:32:08,600 --> 01:32:11,590
是从她的船舱里打捞到的
was recovered from the cabin of her boat.

1125
01:32:11,870 --> 01:32:13,340
这让我很困惑
That troubled me.

1126
01:32:13,380 --> 01:32:15,550
同样令人困惑的还有船的破损情况
As did the nature of the damage to the vessel.

1127
01:32:15,550 --> 01:32:17,510
情况如何
And what was that nature?

1128
01:32:17,600 --> 01:32:19,770
我们发现吃水线下方有四个洞
We found four holes below the waterline

1129
01:32:19,770 --> 01:32:22,810
形状和用鱼叉凿出的洞一致
consistent with those made by a ship's gaff.

1130
01:32:23,490 --> 01:32:25,640
-或用长钉  -说明什么
- Or spike. - Suggesting what?

1131
01:32:25,640 --> 01:32:28,080
说明船是被蓄意凿洞弄沉的
That the boat was deliberately scuttled.

1132
01:32:28,940 --> 01:32:31,100
死因裁判官大人  在我看来
In my opinion, Mr. Coroner,

1133
01:32:31,120 --> 01:32:34,970
此次审理只能作出两种裁决  非此即彼
this inquest can return one of only two verdicts.

1134
01:32:35,350 --> 01:32:39,120
此案不是自杀就是他杀
Suicide or unlawful killing.

1135
01:32:44,990 --> 01:32:47,910
你夫人去世那天去过伦敦
Your wife made a trip to London the day she died.

1136
01:32:48,300 --> 01:32:49,400
到时间了
It's time.

1137
01:32:49,400 --> 01:32:52,980
你在警方录的口供中说
In your statement to the police, you say your wife seemed

1138
01:32:52,980 --> 01:32:56,520
你夫人回来后似乎"心事重重  郁郁寡欢"
"Preoccupied and unhappy" when she returned.

1139
01:32:56,720 --> 01:32:59,420
别表现得太防备  回答问题时保持镇静
Don't be defensive. Answer their questions calmly.

1140
01:33:00,630 --> 01:33:02,640
她去伦敦做什么
What was the purpose of her trip?

1141
01:33:03,220 --> 01:33:04,100
不知道
No idea.

1142
01:33:04,260 --> 01:33:05,970
这正常吗
Was it normal for your wife

1143
01:33:05,970 --> 01:33:08,680
你妻子不和自己丈夫商量这种事
not to discuss such matters with her husband?

1144
01:33:08,680 --> 01:33:11,140
你是在暗示我的婚姻有问题吗
Are you implying there were problems in my marriage?

1145
01:33:11,340 --> 01:33:14,130
我只是想弄清楚为什么去年
I'm trying to understand how you apparently failed

1146
01:33:14,130 --> 01:33:16,470
你并没认出尸体不是你妻子的
to recognize your own wife last year.

1147
01:33:16,470 --> 01:33:18,010
她那时已在海上漂了两个月
She'd been two months at sea.

1148
01:33:18,010 --> 01:33:19,300
她漂流了20英里
She drifted 20 miles.

1149
01:33:19,300 --> 01:33:20,680
尸体已经泡肿腐烂
She was bloated, decomposing,

1150
01:33:20,680 --> 01:33:24,220
她的胳膊没了  面容尽毁
her arms ripped off, ` and there was nothing left of her face.

1151
01:33:24,760 --> 01:33:27,680
肃静  肃静
Order! Order!

1152
01:33:32,470 --> 01:33:35,050
我刚刚真是愚蠢又傲慢
I was arrogant and stupid.

1153
01:33:35,880 --> 01:33:38,800
-我慌了  -不  你只是很激动
- I lost my nerve. - No, you were passionate.

1154
01:33:39,220 --> 01:33:40,390
他们会相信你的
They'll believe it.

1155
01:33:41,340 --> 01:33:43,680
还有谁知道她去伦敦见了医生
Who else knows she saw a doctor in London?

1156
01:33:47,260 --> 01:33:48,680
你  我  还有那位医生
You, me, and the doctor.

1157
01:33:49,590 --> 01:33:52,340
他们不可能找到任何物证的
They're not likely to find any physical evidence.

1158
01:33:53,010 --> 01:33:54,800
毕竟尸体在海上漂了那么久
Not after so long at sea.

1159
01:33:57,340 --> 01:33:58,800
那位医生是他们仅有的证据
The doctor is all they have.

1160
01:34:05,260 --> 01:34:09,010
我和费弗尔先生说了这不欢迎他  但他非要来
I did tell Mr. Favell he wasn't welcome, but he insisted.

1161
01:34:09,260 --> 01:34:10,840
谢谢  丹弗斯太太
Thank you, Mrs. Danvers.

1162
01:34:13,130 --> 01:34:14,840
你到底想要什么
What the hell do you want?

1163
01:34:18,380 --> 01:34:20,180
再来一杯威士忌苏打就挺好
Another whiskey and soda would be nice.

1164
01:34:21,970 --> 01:34:23,220
事关吕蓓卡
It's about Rebecca,

1165
01:34:23,220 --> 01:34:25,340
所以你要不要先叫你妻子去睡觉
so you might want to send your wife off to bed.

1166
01:34:25,340 --> 01:34:26,680
我哪儿都不去
I'm not going anywhere.

1167
01:34:26,760 --> 01:34:28,640
你和吕蓓卡间的事我全都知道
I know all about you and Rebecca.

1168
01:34:29,130 --> 01:34:30,010
是吗
Really?

1169
01:34:30,930 --> 01:34:32,760
你全都知道  是吗
You know all about that, do you?

1170
01:34:34,220 --> 01:34:35,970
你差点被我抓到  费弗尔
You were close, Favell.

1171
01:34:36,380 --> 01:34:38,050
如果那天晚上我抓到了你俩在一起...
If I'd caught you here that night with her...

1172
01:34:38,050 --> 01:34:39,350
那天晚上他根本没来过
He was never here that night.

1173
01:34:39,350 --> 01:34:40,930
但是她确实邀请了我
But she did invite me.

1174
01:34:42,430 --> 01:34:43,470
这是关键
And that's the point.

1175
01:34:44,510 --> 01:34:46,930
不是自杀就是谋杀
Suicide or foul play,

1176
01:34:47,130 --> 01:34:48,930
那家伙是这么说的  对吗
that's what the chap said, wasn't it?

1177
01:34:50,380 --> 01:34:53,220
约别人见面...
Now, inviting someone over...

1178
01:34:53,390 --> 01:34:55,590
听起来不像是一个准备自杀的人
doesn't really sound like the sort of thing one would do

1179
01:34:55,590 --> 01:34:58,970
会做的事  对吗
if one was planning to end it all, does it?

1180
01:35:00,010 --> 01:35:03,720
过去这一年  这事一直折磨着我
And that's what's been driving me mad this last year.

1181
01:35:04,800 --> 01:35:06,640
不过真相开始浮出水面
But it's beginning to make sense.

1182
01:35:08,380 --> 01:35:10,930
她终于决定要离开你
She finally decided to leave you.

1183
01:35:11,260 --> 01:35:12,680
所以你就把她杀了  对吗
Is that why you killed her?

1184
01:35:13,930 --> 01:35:15,180
你没有证据
You've no proof.

1185
01:35:15,760 --> 01:35:17,640
只是你和我各执一词
It's your word against mine.

1186
01:35:17,760 --> 01:35:18,680
不
No.

1187
01:35:21,130 --> 01:35:23,470
是你和吕蓓卡各执一词
It's your word against Rebecca's.

1188
01:35:25,800 --> 01:35:27,970
"收到此信后来曼陀丽庄园
"Come to Manders when you get this.

1189
01:35:28,220 --> 01:35:29,800
有事相告
I've something to tell you

1190
01:35:29,930 --> 01:35:34,340
盼尽快与你相见  吕蓓卡上"
and I want to see you as soon as possible. Rebecca."

1191
01:35:35,220 --> 01:35:35,970
让我看看
Let me see.

1192
01:35:37,430 --> 01:35:39,720
-滚出我的房子  -别被他激怒  迈克西姆
- Get out of my house. - Don't rise to it, Maxim.

1193
01:35:39,720 --> 01:35:42,010
没错  别被我激怒了  迈克斯
Yes. Don't rise to it, Max.

1194
01:35:43,590 --> 01:35:45,800
其实我只是来感谢你的
I only came by to thank you, really.

1195
01:35:46,380 --> 01:35:49,420
这些年来  你一直都很慷慨
You've been so generous over the years,

1196
01:35:49,420 --> 01:35:52,630
和我们这么多男人分享你的妻子
sharing your wife with so many of us chaps.

1197
01:35:53,550 --> 01:35:56,840
事实上  我还想要不要试试勾搭你的新夫人
Actually, I wondered if I might try my luck with the new one.

1198
01:35:59,550 --> 01:36:02,300
来了  这就是我跟你说的暴脾气
There it is. There's that temper I told you about.

1199
01:36:02,550 --> 01:36:04,340
你要多少钱
How much do you want?

1200
01:36:06,470 --> 01:36:08,720
她比看起来要聪明  对吗
She's cleverer than she looks, this one, isn't she?

1201
01:36:11,090 --> 01:36:12,390
好像流血了
Seems to be a spot of blood.

1202
01:36:13,630 --> 01:36:14,760
天呐
Dearie me.

1203
01:36:21,140 --> 01:36:22,300
不过她说得对
She's right, though.

1204
01:36:23,840 --> 01:36:25,760
我不是有钱人  迈克斯
I'm not a rich man, Max.

1205
01:36:27,380 --> 01:36:28,960
我太沉迷赌博  不可能有钱
Well, I'm too fond of gambling for that,

1206
01:36:28,970 --> 01:36:33,720
但我确实喜欢上了某种生活方式
but I do have a certain lifestyle that I've come to enjoy.

1207
01:36:35,970 --> 01:36:38,260
我想大概一万英镑
I imagine I could get by on around...

1208
01:36:39,760 --> 01:36:42,590
能换我这张便条
£10,000 for the note

1209
01:36:42,800 --> 01:36:45,630
并且换我明天出庭作证时不提此事
and my silence when I take the stand tomorrow.

1210
01:36:45,630 --> 01:36:47,390
你这是敲诈
This is blackmail.

1211
01:36:47,470 --> 01:36:50,090
-你要干什么  -报警
- What are you doing? - Calling the police.

1212
01:36:50,800 --> 01:36:52,260
好  报警啊
Yeah. Call the police.

1213
01:36:54,590 --> 01:36:56,510
我们也许还能被关在同一间牢房
Might even put us in the same cell.

1214
01:36:57,760 --> 01:36:58,800
不过关不了多久
Not for long, though.

1215
01:36:59,510 --> 01:37:02,510
你应该会被绞刑处死  迈克西姆
I imagine you're looking at the noose, Maxim.

1216
01:37:09,590 --> 01:37:11,590
应韦尔奇警长的要求
At Inspector Welch's request,

1217
01:37:11,590 --> 01:37:14,720
今早的庭审有所变动
there's a change to this morning's proceedings.

1218
01:37:14,720 --> 01:37:16,090
我们现在听取
We shall now hear

1219
01:37:16,090 --> 01:37:19,840
曼陀丽庄园的管家丹弗斯太太的证词
from the de Winters' housekeeper, Mrs. Danvers.

1220
01:37:27,050 --> 01:37:29,180
可以说  曼陀丽内没什么事是你不知道的
Safe to say not much occurs at Manderley

1221
01:37:29,180 --> 01:37:32,010
或未经你准许的  我说得对吗
without your knowledge or say-so, would I be right?

1222
01:37:32,010 --> 01:37:35,470
我负责确保庄园的有序运转
I ensure the smooth running of the house.

1223
01:37:35,470 --> 01:37:36,970
因此你才会发现
Which is how you came to be aware

1224
01:37:36,970 --> 01:37:40,720
已故德温特夫人和费弗尔先生之间的关系
of the late Mrs. de Winter's relationship with Mr. Favell.

1225
01:37:41,180 --> 01:37:43,840
我知道他们很亲密
Well, I was aware they were, intimate.

1226
01:37:43,840 --> 01:37:45,800
但是我家夫人的私生活是她的私事
But my lady's private affairs were her own.

1227
01:37:45,800 --> 01:37:46,850
理应如此
So they should be.

1228
01:37:46,970 --> 01:37:49,630
不过因为案情十分反常
But since these circumstances are far from normal,

1229
01:37:49,630 --> 01:37:53,390
或许你能当庭分享下你昨晚和我说的事
perhaps you'd share with the court what you told me last night.

1230
01:37:53,760 --> 01:37:56,850
我得知有一张给费弗尔先生的便条
I learned of a note addressed to Mr. Favell.

1231
01:37:57,260 --> 01:38:00,050
我力劝他给你看那张便条
I urged him to share that note with you.

1232
01:38:00,470 --> 01:38:04,220
德温特先生似乎很不想让法庭发现那张便条
A note Mr. de Winter seemed keen to keep from this court.

1233
01:38:04,220 --> 01:38:05,050
是的
Yes.

1234
01:38:05,970 --> 01:38:08,050
便条的内容是邀请费弗尔先生
The note was inviting Mr. Favell

1235
01:38:08,050 --> 01:38:11,390
在德温特夫人去世的那天晚上
to join Mrs. de Winter at the house...

1236
01:38:12,090 --> 01:38:13,970
去庄园见她
the night my lady died.

1237
01:38:14,590 --> 01:38:19,730
德温特先生想用钱交换那张便条
Mr. de Winter offered money in exchange for that note.

1238
01:38:19,730 --> 01:38:21,630
便条是吕蓓卡·德温特写的
The note was from Rebecca de Winter.

1239
01:38:21,630 --> 01:38:22,680
是的
It was.

1240
01:38:23,260 --> 01:38:26,680
她写了有急事要告诉他
She wrote she had urgent news to share with him.

1241
01:38:27,430 --> 01:38:32,840
费弗尔先生收到的开价是多少钱
And how much was Mr. Favell offered?

1242
01:38:33,010 --> 01:38:34,760
一万镑
£10,000.

1243
01:38:40,430 --> 01:38:41,220
这张支票
A check...

1244
01:38:42,890 --> 01:38:45,050
是德温特先生开的
written by Mr. de Winter...

1245
01:38:45,550 --> 01:38:47,920
用来换取那张便条
in exchange for the note.

1246
01:38:47,930 --> 01:38:49,470
你凭什么这么说  仅凭一张支票
Where does it say that? All you have is a check.

1247
01:38:49,470 --> 01:38:52,590
-说明不了用途  -肃静  女士  肃静
- Nothing to say what it's for. - Order! Madam, order.

1248
01:38:53,050 --> 01:38:56,220
丹弗斯太太  你认为
Mrs. Danvers, do you think it's likely

1249
01:38:56,220 --> 01:38:59,300
吕蓓卡·德温特有否可能是溺水自杀
Rebecca de Winter drowned herself?

1250
01:38:59,430 --> 01:39:01,340
不  先生  我不这么认为
No, sir. I do not.

1251
01:39:01,380 --> 01:39:04,260
在她去世前的几周里
In the weeks, leading up to her death,

1252
01:39:04,260 --> 01:39:07,180
她变得倦怠乏力
she had become fatigued

1253
01:39:07,180 --> 01:39:10,510
总是感觉恶心想吐
and was feeling sick.

1254
01:39:10,840 --> 01:39:14,800
她让我放宽了她的裤子腰带
And she asked me to let out the waistband in her trousers.

1255
01:39:14,800 --> 01:39:17,840
她的肚子变大了
Her belly was growing.

1256
01:39:22,260 --> 01:39:24,300
德温特夫人去世那天去了趟伦敦
Mrs. de Winter went to London the day she died.

1257
01:39:24,300 --> 01:39:25,470
她有没有说原因
Did she say why?

1258
01:39:25,510 --> 01:39:26,630
-没有  -奇怪
- No. - Odd.

1259
01:39:26,630 --> 01:39:28,340
一定是非常私人的事情
It must've been something deeply personal

1260
01:39:28,340 --> 01:39:29,930
她不想让我知道
for her to have kept that from me.

1261
01:39:29,930 --> 01:39:32,510
比如说  见她的医生
Like, say, an appointment with her doctor.

1262
01:39:32,510 --> 01:39:34,510
并不是你们料想的家庭医生
Not her family doctor, as you might expect,

1263
01:39:34,510 --> 01:39:35,930
而是某个低调谨慎的医生
but someone discreet.

1264
01:39:37,090 --> 01:39:38,430
她躲避窥探
Away from prying eyes

1265
01:39:38,430 --> 01:39:39,760
似乎并不想
as if news of her condition

1266
01:39:39,760 --> 01:39:42,220
让别人知道她的身体状况
was something she wished to keep private.

1267
01:39:42,380 --> 01:39:46,050
她只愿意告诉她的情人
A wish to share only with her lover,

1268
01:39:46,380 --> 01:39:47,760
杰克·费弗尔
Jack Favell.

1269
01:39:48,380 --> 01:39:51,880
你这该死的杀人犯  你是该死的杀人犯
You murdering bastard. You're a murdering bastard!

1270
01:39:51,880 --> 01:39:54,930
你还杀了我的孩子  我希望他们把你绞死
With my child! I hope they hang you.

1271
01:39:55,260 --> 01:39:57,470
我希望他们把你绞死  你杀了吕蓓卡
I hope they hang you! You murdered Rebecca!

1272
01:39:57,470 --> 01:39:59,140
结论只可能有两种
Only two possible verdicts.

1273
01:39:59,140 --> 01:40:03,340
希望你赞同  先生  本案完全没有自杀动机
I hope you agree, sir, that there's no motive at all for suicide.

1274
01:40:03,340 --> 01:40:05,670
但显然有谋杀动机
But a clear one for murder.

1275
01:40:05,670 --> 01:40:10,010
审理暂缓  等待刑事调查结果
This inquest is suspended pending a criminal investigation.

1276
01:40:10,010 --> 01:40:12,930
女士们先生们  我宣布休庭
Ladies and gentlemen, court is adjourned.

1277
01:40:13,550 --> 01:40:15,470
没人能凌驾于法律之上
Nobody's above the law.

1278
01:40:16,140 --> 01:40:18,720
放开我  放开
Get your hands off me! Get off!

1279
01:40:18,800 --> 01:40:20,010
丹弗斯太太
Mrs. Danvers.

1280
01:40:20,510 --> 01:40:22,260
什么也没别说  他们没有任何证据
Say nothing. They can't prove anything.

1281
01:40:22,260 --> 01:40:24,340
我要她的日程簿  日记  通讯录
I want her appointment books, diaries, address books,

1282
01:40:24,340 --> 01:40:26,260
家庭账本  所有东西
household finances, everything.

1283
01:40:26,260 --> 01:40:29,510
她在某个时间见过那医生  并付了他钱
She saw that doctor sometime and she paid him.

1284
01:40:30,340 --> 01:40:33,590
罗  开始打电话询问伦敦的妇科医生
Roe, start placing calls to women specialists in London.

1285
01:41:03,930 --> 01:41:05,430
不  不
No. No.

1286
01:41:12,930 --> 01:41:15,760
抱歉  请问你们有搜查许可吗
I'm sorry, do you have permission to search this place?

1287
01:41:15,290 --> 01:41:16,550
{\an8}吕

1288
01:41:35,010 --> 01:41:36,050
德温特夫人
Mrs. de Winter?

1289
01:41:36,590 --> 01:41:37,670
-弗兰克  -怎么了
- Frank! - What?

1290
01:41:37,680 --> 01:41:39,760
我需要她的支票  银行对账单
I need her checks, her bank statements.

1291
01:41:39,760 --> 01:41:42,220
任何写有她医生的姓名和地址的东西
Anything that has the name and address of her doctor.

1292
01:41:42,220 --> 01:41:43,460
好  是这些
Right. Here it is.

1293
01:41:43,470 --> 01:41:44,970
我知道你需要什么
I know what you need.

1294
01:41:48,510 --> 01:41:50,470
-我需要找到医生  -你要找她的医生  这里
- I need a doctor. - You need her doctor? There.

1295
01:41:49,830 --> 01:41:51,910
{\an8}约·贝克医生合伙诊所

1296
01:41:52,300 --> 01:41:53,260
一定就是这个
That must be it.

1297
01:41:55,590 --> 01:41:56,800
你真无耻
Shame on you.

1298
01:41:57,590 --> 01:41:59,720
太无耻了  你竟然站在他那边
Shame on you for taking his side.

1299
01:41:59,720 --> 01:42:02,090
我没站在任何人那边  丹弗斯太太  我...
I'm not taking anyone's side, Mrs. Danvers. I...

1300
01:42:02,090 --> 01:42:04,010
还有你  弗兰克
And you, Frank.

1301
01:42:04,300 --> 01:42:07,050
白天舔着德温特夫人的靴子
Licking Mr. de Winter's boots by day,

1302
01:42:07,050 --> 01:42:10,090
晚上抓挠小屋的门
and pawing at the cottage door at night.

1303
01:42:10,090 --> 01:42:12,430
像个小男孩一样啜泣
Sobbing like a schoolboy.

1304
01:42:13,340 --> 01:42:15,680
她看不起你们所有人
She despised you all.

1305
01:42:16,340 --> 01:42:19,720
伦敦的那些男人  参加曼陀丽舞会的那些男人
The men in London, the men at the Manderley parties.

1306
01:42:19,720 --> 01:42:22,890
你们都只是她的玩物
You were nothing but playthings for her.

1307
01:42:23,640 --> 01:42:27,180
女人为什么不能找乐子
And why shouldn't a woman amuse herself?

1308
01:42:30,470 --> 01:42:35,260
她随心所欲地生活  我的吕蓓卡
She lived her life as she pleased, my Rebecca.

1309
01:42:38,380 --> 01:42:40,720
难怪男人不得不杀了她
No wonder a man had to kill her.

1310
01:42:43,010 --> 01:42:44,640
你一定很心痛
It must have hurt.

1311
01:42:45,930 --> 01:42:47,380
知道你在世上唯一的朋友
Knowing your only friend in the world

1312
01:42:47,380 --> 01:42:49,800
把那样的秘密带进坟墓
took a secret like that to her grave.

1313
01:42:53,050 --> 01:42:55,180
收拾好你的东西  丹弗斯太太
Pack your bags, Mrs. Danvers.

1314
01:42:55,970 --> 01:42:57,840
我要你天黑之前就走人
I expect you gone by nightfall.

1315
01:44:39,250 --> 01:44:40,790
{\an8}伦敦哈利街79b
约·贝克医生合伙诊所

1316
01:44:45,180 --> 01:44:46,670
-小姐  有什么事  -真抱歉
- Miss? - Terribly sorry,

1317
01:44:46,680 --> 01:44:48,220
我忘拿手提包了
I've left my purse.

1318
01:44:48,380 --> 01:44:50,430
你见的是哪位医生  小姐
Who was it you saw, Miss?

1319
01:44:50,470 --> 01:44:52,010
约翰·贝克医生
Dr. John Baker.

1320
01:44:58,340 --> 01:44:59,300
谢谢
Thank you.

1321
01:45:05,970 --> 01:45:06,970
在那儿等着
Wait there.

1322
01:45:16,760 --> 01:45:19,220
-贝克医生诊所  -晚上好  塔斯
- Dr. Baker, sir. - Good evening, Tas.

1323
01:45:23,800 --> 01:45:24,890
"丹弗斯"
"Danvers."

1324
01:45:36,930 --> 01:45:39,510
我见过无数病人
I see so many patients.

1325
01:45:42,220 --> 01:45:43,470
我不记得她
I can't remember her.

1326
01:45:43,840 --> 01:45:47,340
你看到她的病历也许就能想起来
Maybe it'll come back when you see her file.

1327
01:45:51,130 --> 01:45:52,680
先看看病例
It would have been more convenient

1328
01:45:52,680 --> 01:45:54,590
自然会更方便
to read the file to begin with.

1329
01:45:57,090 --> 01:45:59,220
我们会尽力帮忙
We'll do what we can to help.

1330
01:45:59,520 --> 01:46:02,730
不  不该这样
Oh, no. This is not as it should be.

1331
01:46:04,270 --> 01:46:05,650
她去哪儿了
Where's she gone now?

1332
01:46:06,150 --> 01:46:06,940
谁
Who?

1333
01:46:08,040 --> 01:46:08,830
{\an8}请勿让患者接触

1334
01:46:08,980 --> 01:46:10,570
之前在这里的年轻女子
The young woman who was here.

1335
01:46:13,940 --> 01:46:14,900
不在这里
It's not here.

1336
01:46:15,760 --> 01:46:17,840
我问问我的秘书
I'll have a word with my secretary.

1337
01:46:19,500 --> 01:46:20,620
{\an8}X光结果显示子宫内有根深蒂固的肿块

1338
01:46:21,020 --> 01:46:23,170
她可能把病历放错地方了
It's possible she misplaced it.

1339
01:46:23,650 --> 01:46:28,360
那个女孩有没有可能离开这里
This girl. Is there any way she could get out of here?

1340
01:46:27,750 --> 01:46:31,500
{\an8}认为是恶性子宫肉瘤

1341
01:46:58,600 --> 01:46:59,860
我只是看了  仅此而已
I read it, that's all.

1342
01:46:59,860 --> 01:47:01,670
我没改过贝克医生半个字
I haven't changed a word Dr. Baker wrote.

1343
01:47:01,670 --> 01:47:02,860
吕蓓卡·丹弗斯
Rebecca Danvers.

1344
01:47:02,860 --> 01:47:05,560
是的  现在我想起来了  很可怕的病
Yes, now I remember. Terrible thing.

1345
01:47:05,560 --> 01:47:06,820
那不是她的真名
That wasn't her real name.

1346
01:47:07,270 --> 01:47:08,600
她也没怀孕
And she wasn't pregnant.

1347
01:47:08,610 --> 01:47:10,440
那她为什么要用假名
Then why would she use a false name?

1348
01:47:10,440 --> 01:47:12,770
她为什么要大老远跑来伦敦
Why would she come all the way to London

1349
01:47:12,770 --> 01:47:14,060
预约你给她看诊
to make an appointment with you

1350
01:47:14,070 --> 01:47:15,730
而不找她的家庭医生
and not her family doctor?

1351
01:47:15,730 --> 01:47:18,190
或许她不想让家人知道这个噩耗
Perhaps she wanted to spare her family the news.

1352
01:47:18,190 --> 01:47:20,320
什么  知道孩子不是她丈夫的吗
That the baby wasn't her husband's?

1353
01:47:20,520 --> 01:47:24,560
警长  我不是那种妇科医生
Inspector, I am not that kind of women's specialist.

1354
01:47:24,560 --> 01:47:26,190
我不是产科医师
I'm not an obstetrician.

1355
01:47:26,270 --> 01:47:28,860
我的专长是肿瘤学
My field is oncology.

1356
01:47:28,900 --> 01:47:32,190
我治疗生殖系统的癌症
I treat cancers of the reproductive system.

1357
01:47:32,190 --> 01:47:33,440
她肿胀  疲乏
The bloating, the fatigue.

1358
01:47:33,440 --> 01:47:34,900
这些都是常见症状
They're common symptoms.

1359
01:47:36,190 --> 01:47:37,520
她患了癌症
She had cancer.

1360
01:47:39,900 --> 01:47:41,610
她想告诉杰克·费弗尔的就是这事
There's her news for Jack Favell.

1361
01:47:41,690 --> 01:47:43,980
这并不能证明她是自杀的
That doesn't prove she killed herself.

1362
01:47:44,060 --> 01:47:46,150
她不会想遭受病痛折磨
She wouldn't have wanted to suffer.

1363
01:47:46,310 --> 01:47:48,980
没错  她也这么跟我说的
Yes, she told me as much.

1364
01:47:49,190 --> 01:47:52,150
她出现症状时已经是晚期
She was very advanced by the time she was symptomatic.

1365
01:47:52,150 --> 01:47:53,310
我第一次见她是在四月
Saw her first in April,

1366
01:47:53,310 --> 01:47:56,650
到五月时  她显然已经病重得无法医治
by May, it was clear she was too far gone for treatment.

1367
01:47:56,860 --> 01:47:57,940
她只剩下几周时间
She only had weeks

1368
01:47:57,940 --> 01:48:01,130
并且会遭受巨大痛苦
and the pain would have been considerable.

1369
01:48:02,190 --> 01:48:03,270
她如何自尽的
How did she do it?

1370
01:48:05,650 --> 01:48:08,270
她把船取出来凿穿
She took out her boat and scuttled it.

1371
01:48:09,440 --> 01:48:11,190
然后把自己淹死了
She drowned herself.

1372
01:48:53,550 --> 01:48:55,550
你真走运  迈克斯
Stroke of luck for you there, Max.

1373
01:49:04,970 --> 01:49:06,760
你一定认为你赢了  对吧
I bet you think you've won, don't you?

1374
01:49:08,560 --> 01:49:10,400
也许法律不能惩罚你
Well, maybe the law can't get you.

1375
01:49:10,610 --> 01:49:11,600
但我仍然可以
I still can.

1376
01:49:13,020 --> 01:49:14,690
你还有别的话想说吗
Is there anything else you want to say?

1377
01:49:16,400 --> 01:49:17,940
如果有就赶紧说
If there is, you better say it now.

1378
01:49:31,810 --> 01:49:33,730
你知道我最恨她哪一点吗
Do you know what I hate her for most?

1379
01:49:35,520 --> 01:49:37,230
她夺走了你的纯真
It's what she's taken from you.

1380
01:49:38,440 --> 01:49:39,300
那一去不复返了
It's gone forever.

1381
01:49:39,300 --> 01:49:43,430
我所钟爱的那些幽默  朝气  迷惘的神情
That funny, young, lost look I loved so much.

1382
01:49:44,630 --> 01:49:46,260
你不再是从前那个女孩了
You're not that person anymore.

1383
01:49:46,920 --> 01:49:48,630
别因为这个恨她
Don't hate her for that.

1384
01:50:22,120 --> 01:50:24,850
{\an8}吕

1385
01:50:33,020 --> 01:50:34,110
什么东西着火了
What's that burning?

1386
01:50:34,730 --> 01:50:36,270
天呐  是曼陀丽庄园
Oh, my God, that's Manderley.

1387
01:50:44,730 --> 01:50:46,690
快点  离开那里
Come on! Get away from there.

1388
01:50:46,730 --> 01:50:48,570
离开草坪  快走
Get off the lawn! Go! Come on!

1389
01:50:51,150 --> 01:50:53,270
离开草坪  弗里思  快离开草坪
Get off the lawn! Frith, get off the lawn!

1390
01:50:53,440 --> 01:50:54,980
屋里有多少人  大家都逃出来了吗
How many people are inside? Is everyone out?

1391
01:50:54,980 --> 01:50:55,980
我不知道  老爷
I don't know, sir.

1392
01:50:56,050 --> 01:50:58,260
你没事吧  发生了什么  克拉丽斯
You all right? What happened, Clarice?

1393
01:50:58,970 --> 01:50:59,770
我看见她了
I saw her.

1394
01:50:59,770 --> 01:51:01,190
什么意思  你看见谁了
What do you mean? Who did you see?

1395
01:51:01,190 --> 01:51:02,900
丹弗斯太太
Mrs. Danvers.

1396
01:51:02,940 --> 01:51:04,320
帮帮她
Help her! Help her!

1397
01:51:05,270 --> 01:51:06,490
水管在哪儿
Where are the hoses?

1398
01:51:06,520 --> 01:51:08,690
她在哪里  她在哪里
Where is she? Where is she!

1399
01:51:08,810 --> 01:51:10,730
她去船库了
She went to the boat house.

1400
01:52:18,940 --> 01:52:21,630
丹弗斯太太  求求你
Mrs. Danvers! Please!

1401
01:52:22,400 --> 01:52:23,650
别站在悬崖边
Please come away.

1402
01:52:25,150 --> 01:52:27,480
你叫我帮助你  我这就是在帮你
You asked for my help. Here it is.

1403
01:52:28,110 --> 01:52:29,770
丹弗斯太太  求你了
Mrs. Danvers, please.

1404
01:52:30,730 --> 01:52:33,400
他杀了我唯一爱过的人
He killed the only person I loved.

1405
01:52:34,440 --> 01:52:36,480
我不能让你们夺走曼陀丽庄园
I can't let you have Manderley.

1406
01:52:37,650 --> 01:52:39,440
那是属于我们的  你明白吗
It was ours, you see.

1407
01:52:40,810 --> 01:52:42,360
你不必这么做
You don't have to do this.

1408
01:52:42,360 --> 01:52:44,570
我知道你会支持他
I know you'll stand by him.

1409
01:52:45,190 --> 01:52:47,150
但你永远不会知晓幸福的滋味
But you'll never know happiness.

1410
01:52:50,320 --> 01:52:51,450
我会的
Yes, I will.

1411
01:53:53,230 --> 01:53:56,020
昨晚  我又梦到我去了曼陀丽庄园
Last night, I dreamt I went to Manderley again.

1412
01:53:58,520 --> 01:54:01,570
我梦见了丹弗斯太太和吕蓓卡
I dreamt of Mrs. Danvers and of Rebecca.

1413
01:54:05,900 --> 01:54:07,820
但今早我醒来后
But this morning I woke up

1414
01:54:08,760 --> 01:54:10,720
就把逝者抛诸脑后
and left the dead behind.

1415
01:54:12,860 --> 01:54:14,560
我坐在镜子前
And as I sit before the mirror

1416
01:54:14,560 --> 01:54:17,440
身处我们在开罗的闷热房间里
in our stuffy little room in Cairo,

1417
01:54:18,520 --> 01:54:22,400
这只是其中一站  直到我们找到真正的家
just another stop on our quest to find a real home,

1418
01:54:24,310 --> 01:54:26,440
我能看清我现在变成了什么样子
I can see the woman I am now.

1419
01:54:28,570 --> 01:54:31,300
我知道我做出了正确决定
And I know that I have made the right decision...

1420
01:54:34,260 --> 01:54:38,010
拯救了唯一值得为之赴汤蹈火的东西
to save the one thing worth walking through flames for.

1421
01:54:40,760 --> 01:54:41,630
爱
Love.

1422
01:55:03,760 --> 01:55:12,630
