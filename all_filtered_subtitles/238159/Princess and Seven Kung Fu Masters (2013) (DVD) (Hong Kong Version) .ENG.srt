1
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:49,701
In the early stage of Mingguo£¬
the political status was messy

2
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:52,576
The Nationalist Government
was incapable of controlling the situation

3
00:01:52,846 --> 00:01:54,871
that made the powerful countries
from outside try to bully and oppress her

4
00:01:55,048 --> 00:01:56,572
While warlords from
inside monopolized different areas

5
00:01:56,983 --> 00:01:58,109
A lot of bandits were bullying around

6
00:01:58,751 --> 00:02:00,651
There were also endless spying activities

7
00:02:01,921 --> 00:02:03,513
That's what happened

8
00:02:03,723 --> 00:02:04,951
Below the Ngau Tau Shan

9
00:02:06,559 --> 00:02:08,789
The warlord Warlord Lin had monopolized an area

10
00:02:09,095 --> 00:02:10,585
He hates the Japanese invasion most

11
00:02:11,197 --> 00:02:12,824
and uses all his efforts
to fight against the Japanese

12
00:02:12,932 --> 00:02:14,763
The Japanese treat him as an eyesore

13
00:02:15,902 --> 00:02:16,960
The Tiger Den down the hill

14
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:19,639
has some local tyrants who take over an area

15
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:22,301
Tiger Hong£¬ Leopard Hong
and Phoenix Hong. They are siblings

16
00:02:22,842 --> 00:02:23,672
They do all kinds of bad things

17
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:25,345
And they tie with Japanese

18
00:02:25,345 --> 00:02:27,745
They hold the candle to the devil
and bully the common people

19
00:02:28,081 --> 00:02:29,878
They are well-known traitors

20
00:02:32,785 --> 00:02:35,618
However more than
15 kilometers outside Tiger Den

21
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:36,948
There is a Lucky Star Town

22
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:38,851
which is just like a fairy land

23
00:02:40,293 --> 00:02:42,591
The common people live happily in here

24
00:02:46,332 --> 00:02:47,799
Until that day..

25
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:50,637
Have we been to this town£¿

26
00:02:50,637 --> 00:02:51,228
No

27
00:02:51,304 --> 00:02:52,005
Why£¿

28
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:54,200
The old man said this town is weird

29
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:55,637
Maybe he suffered before

30
00:02:55,942 --> 00:02:57,341
He told us not to bother
those people In Lucky Star Town

31
00:02:57,744 --> 00:02:58,978
This moth-eaten

32
00:02:58,978 --> 00:03:00,343
Is too old that he doesn't have the guts

33
00:03:00,613 --> 00:03:01,602
How can we not kill him£¿

34
00:03:01,881 --> 00:03:02,905
Let's go down Thereafter
we have finished our breakfast

35
00:03:03,082 --> 00:03:04,640
Rob the money£¬ the food and the women!
Good!

36
00:03:14,661 --> 00:03:17,357
Don't miss out as you walk past

37
00:03:17,997 --> 00:03:20,192
Come£¬ take a look..

38

You dare to beat me£¿

00:16:50,743 --> 00:16:54,736
No one after so she focuses on cooking

336
00:16:56,448 --> 00:16:59,042
Manysons is holding a little boy

337
00:16:59,785 --> 00:17:03,016
Very supportive. So cute

338
00:17:04,623 --> 00:17:07,717
Little Trumpet
and Mademoiselle Hong are falling In love

339
00:17:08,127 --> 00:17:11,722
Madonna is going to break them up

340
00:17:13,665 --> 00:17:16,600
Chanting Bing is teaching the grannies

341
00:17:17,102 --> 00:17:20,196
Tai Chi Punch. He is awesome

342
00:17:20,672 --> 00:17:23,766
Miss Manuelle had ogled towards here

343
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:27,638
Though making soya sauce£¬
We are happy from our heart

344
00:17:32,651 --> 00:17:34,414
I look to the left and look to the right

345
00:17:34,586 --> 00:17:35,917
Look upwards and downards

346
00:17:36,188 --> 00:17:39,487
All the lucky stars
In the Lucky Star Town are so simple

347
00:17:39,658 --> 00:17:41,125
I sing and sing

348
00:17:41,193 --> 00:17:42,888
I swing and swing

349
00:17:43,195 --> 00:17:46,995
The lucky stars in the Lucky Star Town are cute

350
00:17:47,132 --> 00:17:49,123
The seven Kung Fu Masters

351
00:17:49,501 --> 00:17:53,528
Here Comes..

352
00:17:53,772 --> 00:17:54,636
Lucky Star Town..

353
00:17:55,541 --> 00:18:00,638
Here Comes..

354
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:09,151
Xing 's wife£¬ has father come back yet£¿

355
00:18:09,555 --> 00:18:10,255
Miss is back

356
00:18:10,255 --> 00:18:11,187
General's schedule is delayed for one day

357
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:11,984
He can only be back tomorrow

358
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:14,491
That's bad news

359
00:18:15,227 --> 00:18:16,489
Yet£¬ In a way it is good news

360
00:18:16,695 --> 00:18:18,263
That means I have one more day

361
00:18:18,263 --> 00:18:19,798
to prepare something delicious for father

362
00:18:19,798 --> 00:18:20,230
Ok

363
00:18:23,569 --> 00:18:24,303
According to the information

364
00:18:24,303 --> 00:18:26,171
Tiger Den had already formed
an alliance with the Japanese

365
00:18:26,171 --> 00:18:28,640
And transformed it into a covert
Intelligence camp for Japanese spies

366
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,164
Information reveals that the lady spy Kurosawa
Kiyoko will be arriving in these two days

367
00:18:30,876 --> 00:18:32,277
Then we should get the name list
as soon as possible then

368
00:18:32,277 --> 00:18:33,245
Otherwise There will be trouble

369
00:18:33,245 --> 00:18:34,906
We go in There to investigate just after dusk

370
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:35,681
No way

371
00:18:35,681 --> 00:18:37,649
Why don't we wait
For Tony Luo and do it together

372
00:18:37,916 --> 00:18:38,917
Tony Luo..

373
00:18:38,917 --> 00:18:40,214
He needs two more days to arrive

374
00:18:40,552 --> 00:18:41,177
I'm afraid we can't wait

375
00:18:41,653 --> 00:18:42,483
We just need to be careful

376
00:18:43,722 --> 00:18:44,211
Let's go

377
00:18:45,824 --> 00:18:47,587
Welcome Miss Kurosawa

378
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:51,096
Please forgive us
for not picking you up soon..

379
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:53,659
My main purpose of coming here this time

380
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:55,763
Is to take care of Warlord Lin

381
00:18:57,169 --> 00:18:59,933
That fatso is hard to take care

382
00:19:00,706 --> 00:19:02,537
He has a rough temper
and his kung fu is very good

383
00:19:02,908 --> 00:19:04,102
I've tried many attempts

384
00:19:04,676 --> 00:19:06,109
but I have never found a chance

385
00:19:07,246 --> 00:19:09,771
If he could be bought£¬ buy him

386
00:19:11,049 --> 00:19:13,813
If he can't£¬ kill him

387
00:19:17,022 --> 00:19:18,649
It seems that someone is looking for you

388
00:19:52,057 --> 00:19:54,252
As expected£¬
it is really the Japanese intelligence camp

389
00:19:57,296 --> 00:19:58,263
I found it

390
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:00,764
The confidential list of Japanese spies

391
00:20:01,233 --> 00:20:02,401
The senior had been looking fo rthis

392
00:20:02,401 --> 00:20:03,197
Janice£¬ you keep it safe

393
00:20:04,102 --> 00:20:05,831
Spy came£¬ go and get him

394
00:20:32,731 --> 00:20:33,390
Let's see where you can escape

395
00:20:34,433 --> 00:20:35,263
You go first

396
00:20:35,968 --> 00:20:36,366
Be careful!

397
00:20:49,781 --> 00:20:50,270
Go quickly!

398
00:21:04,396 --> 00:21:05,090
Leopard Hong£¿

399
00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:06,126
Are you afraid now£¿

400
00:22:16,301 --> 00:22:16,960
Let's go

401
00:23:39,384 --> 00:23:40,180
Good

402
00:23:41,586 --> 00:23:42,421
We should take care
Of the important things first

403
00:23:42,421 --> 00:23:43,319
Go quickly!

404
00:25:03,468 --> 00:25:04,628
He was hurt by my dart and poison palm

405
00:25:05,303 --> 00:25:06,600
He shouldn't be able to escape too far

406
00:25:07,706 --> 00:25:08,502
Go after him!

407
00:25:37,469 --> 00:25:40,097
Miss£¬ what are you thinking about£¿

408
00:25:40,639 --> 00:25:43,475
I am thinking what I should cook for dad

409
00:25:43,475 --> 00:25:44,703
when he is back to morrow

410
00:25:45,043 --> 00:25:46,578
General loves you so much

411
00:25:46,578 --> 00:25:49,274
He would love whatever you cook for him

412
00:25:49,381 --> 00:25:52,043
Dad is so poor since mom had died

413
00:25:52,450 --> 00:25:54,085
No woman takes care of him

414
00:25:54,085 --> 00:25:56,212
Therefore I have to take care of dad for mom

415
00:25:58,723 --> 00:25:59,655
What are you doing£¿

416
00:26:01,393 --> 00:26:02,485
What is the sound outside£¿

417
00:26:02,694 --> 00:26:03,991
Shall I go and check it out

418
00:26:06,398 --> 00:26:08,099
Tiger Hong£¬ are you Insane£¿

419
00:26:08,099 --> 00:26:10,192
You dare come to General Lin's home
and make trouble£¿

420
00:26:12,671 --> 00:26:14,161
We are the best citizens

421
00:26:14,472 --> 00:26:16,667
Someone had stolen
Our stuff and hid it In There

422
00:26:17,342 --> 00:26:19,139
So tell me£¬ what should we do£¿

423
00:26:19,311 --> 00:26:20,005
Bullshit!

424
00:26:20,345 --> 00:26:21,369
Why would we have a thief In here£¿

425
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:23,170
Then let us In to take a look

426
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:24,149
You dare!

427
00:26:24,149 --> 00:26:26,276
General Lin's family is Inside£¬
How dare you barge In

428
00:26:42,167 --> 00:26:43,498
Why are all of you at my home£¿

429
00:26:43,802 --> 00:26:44,564
Go away£¬ all of you

430
00:26:44,769 --> 00:26:45,701
General Lin

431
00:26:46,204 --> 00:26:48,172
Mr. Ishihara has given you an offer

432
00:26:48,373 --> 00:26:49,499
He is still waiting for your reply

433
00:26:50,075 --> 00:26:50,666
Really£¿

434
00:26:51,343 --> 00:26:53,641
His offer is enough
for me to spend for two lives

435
00:26:57,148 --> 00:26:59,708
So we...will become a family soon

436
00:27:01,086 --> 00:27:01,609
Don't move!

437
00:27:03,688 --> 00:27:04,279
Let me tell you

438
00:27:04,623 --> 00:27:06,557
For all these years In my life
I have had the courage to do anything I want

439
00:27:07,258 --> 00:27:08,657
But I dare not be a traitor

440
00:27:09,461 --> 00:27:10,257
Leave!

441
00:27:19,304 --> 00:27:20,601
What happened£¿

442
00:27:25,777 --> 00:27:26,607
Tony Luo..

443
00:27:27,345 --> 00:27:28,403
Tony Luo£¬ are you ok£¿

444
00:27:29,848 --> 00:27:30,712
Don't come In!

445
00:27:31,516 --> 00:27:32,346
This is dad!

446
00:27:32,550 --> 00:27:33,414
Not even you£¬ dad

447
00:27:33,685 --> 00:27:34,652
I am bathing

448
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:36,544
So why are you screaming£¿

449
00:27:36,721 --> 00:27:38,552
I slipped over just now

450
00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:39,757
Be careful

451
00:27:40,125 --> 00:27:40,682
Ok

452
00:27:44,829 --> 00:27:46,626
What was Tiger Hong's reason for coming£¿

453
00:27:47,232 --> 00:27:49,267
He said a thief had stolen his property

454
00:27:49,267 --> 00:27:49,801
so he came here

455
00:27:49,801 --> 00:27:50,358
Bullshit

456
00:27:53,104 --> 00:27:53,729
Go and check around

457
00:27:54,472 --> 00:27:55,632
In case someone really broke In

458
00:27:56,441 --> 00:27:57,100
Yes

459
00:27:58,209 --> 00:27:59,301
Go

460
00:28:05,083 --> 00:28:06,311
Come on£¬ slowly. Lay down first

461
00:28:09,387 --> 00:28:10,319
You woke

462
00:28:10,855 --> 00:28:11,719
I have a dart on my back

463
00:28:12,691 --> 00:28:13,555
and you put me down like this..

464
00:28:14,325 --> 00:28:15,724
How could I not be awaken£¿

465
00:28:16,161 --> 00:28:17,150
I'm sorry

466
00:28:17,562 --> 00:28:18,824
How should I help you then£¿

467
00:28:19,264 --> 00:28:20,865
Pick the dart out for me

468
00:28:20,865 --> 00:28:21,627
Stop the bleeding

469
00:28:22,167 --> 00:28:24,260
Sterilize and warp it

470
00:28:25,270 --> 00:28:25,637
Ok

471
00:28:25,637 --> 00:28:27,195
Give me some anti-inflammatory

472
00:28:28,873 --> 00:28:30,170
Have you finished bathing£¿

473
00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:31,566
I've finished

474
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:32,540
Then I am coming In

475
00:28:34,579 --> 00:28:35,637
Dad. What happened£¿

476
00:28:36,881 --> 00:28:38,314
Nothing

477
00:28:38,616 --> 00:28:40,243
I was just worried that some bad guys came In

478
00:28:40,351 --> 00:28:41,352
Dad

479
00:28:41,352 --> 00:28:43,354
How would someone dare
To do anything offensive to us£¿

480
00:28:43,354 --> 00:28:44,514
You should take rest earlier

481
00:28:44,723 --> 00:28:45,690
That's true

482
00:28:52,597 --> 00:28:53,398
You've grown

483
00:28:53,398 --> 00:28:55,298
Yes£¬ I've grown

484
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:57,593
No£¬ I mean your legs have grown

485
00:28:58,770 --> 00:29:00,761
You don't come back often£¬
So you can't even recognize me

486
00:29:00,939 --> 00:29:02,770
Go out...I'm not gonna chat with you

487
00:29:08,947 --> 00:29:09,436
Wait£¬ no

488
00:29:10,682 --> 00:29:12,206
Your upper body reacts.
Why doesn't your leg show reaction£¿

489
00:29:14,686 --> 00:29:18,281
It does. But the reaction is a bits low

490
00:29:20,191 --> 00:29:20,714
Ok

491
00:29:21,359 --> 00:29:22,383
Take some good rest

492
00:29:22,727 --> 00:29:23,625
Scream In case of anything

493
00:29:23,695 --> 00:29:24,423
Ok

494
00:29:33,772 --> 00:29:36,798
Honey£¬ Cheryl has really grown up

495
00:29:37,809 --> 00:29:40,676
There must be a man In her bed

496
00:29:41,312 --> 00:29:42,779
What should I do£¿

497
00:29:44,549 --> 00:29:46,176
Since you left me

498
00:29:47,452 --> 00:29:49,386
I didn't have the time to accompany her

499
00:29:50,421 --> 00:29:53,185
But shall I reveal her behaviours now£¿

500
00:29:53,358 --> 00:29:54,586
Or shall I let go£¿

501
00:29:55,226 --> 00:29:57,592
If I really drag the guy out from her bed

502
00:29:58,329 --> 00:29:59,591
she'll hate me for life

503
00:30:00,965 --> 00:30:01,761
What£¿

504
00:30:03,568 --> 00:30:04,728
Let her be£¿

505
00:30:06,237 --> 00:30:07,932
That means I should pretend that I saw nothing£¿

506
00:30:09,908 --> 00:30:12,809
Yes. I should let Cheryl be happier

507
00:30:14,245 --> 00:30:15,872
Wife£¬ you are right

508
00:30:16,514 --> 00:30:17,538
I will listen to you

509
00:31:37,662 --> 00:31:39,653
Wait a moment. I am going to get some medicine

510
00:32:24,142 --> 00:32:25,109
What should I do£¿

511
00:32:25,677 --> 00:32:27,611
Cut..

512
00:32:28,079 --> 00:32:28,613
Cut it..

513
00:32:28,613 --> 00:32:29,637
Oh£¬ cut it

514
00:32:36,955 --> 00:32:38,047
Needs to sterilize..

515
00:32:39,023 --> 00:32:40,124
Sterilize..

516
00:32:40,124 --> 00:32:41,421
Sterilize£¿

517
00:33:30,708 --> 00:33:31,800
Are you feeling better£¿

518
00:33:33,511 --> 00:33:34,569
A bit better

519
00:33:37,648 --> 00:33:39,479
But you can't stay here

520
00:33:40,118 --> 00:33:42,643
If my dad finds out£¬ we're in trouble

521
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:53,053
General

522
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:56,432
Go and keep an eye on miss

523
00:33:56,634 --> 00:33:57,532
Yes

524
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:11,175
Taoist£¬ Taoist..

525
00:34:14,519 --> 00:34:14,746
Taoist

526
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:16,684
Take a seat first

527
00:34:17,155 --> 00:34:18,782
Why did you bring this person£¿

528
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:22,091
They said everyone In town comes to find you when
It concerns births£¬ deaths£¬ aging and illnesses

529
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:23,557
Please save him

530
00:34:23,694 --> 00:34:24,661
Let me take a look

531
00:34:26,097 --> 00:34:27,928
Taoist£¬ please save him

532
00:34:29,567 --> 00:34:32,537
Right£¬ the live and dead could come and see me

533
00:34:32,537 --> 00:34:35,062
But he is right between them. Why are you here£¿

534
00:34:35,606 --> 00:34:37,699
So who should I look for£¿

535
00:34:38,076 --> 00:34:40,772
Just hand him over to us would do

536
00:34:41,879 --> 00:34:42,777
Hand him to you£¿

537
00:34:43,681 --> 00:34:46,844
Hand ove rto us. What are you worried about£¿

538
00:34:47,151 --> 00:34:50,211
As long as he is a man£¬ we can cure him

539
00:34:50,621 --> 00:34:51,485
What happened£¿

540
00:34:52,290 --> 00:34:53,086
What's up£¿

541
00:34:53,257 --> 00:34:55,657
He is dying. Please save him

542
00:34:56,561 --> 00:34:57,255
Who is he£¿

543
00:34:58,062 --> 00:34:59,263
Don't worry about it first

544
00:34:59,263 --> 00:35:00,565
However if he dies

545
00:35:00,565 --> 00:35:01,623
I won't talk to you forever

546
00:35:08,639 --> 00:35:11,608
He is hurt so badly.
Only Madonna could cure him

547
00:35:11,809 --> 00:35:12,707
Can she£¿

548
00:35:13,778 --> 00:35:15,803
She has a super reviving pill

549
00:35:15,913 --> 00:35:18,216
which could cure all diseases including
Internal Injury£¬ kidney disease£¬ pimples

550
00:35:18,216 --> 00:35:20,514
constipation£¬ disorder£¬ syphilis£¬ athlete foot

551
00:35:20,785 --> 00:35:23,754
As long as he isn't dead£¬ it could be cured

552
00:35:23,955 --> 00:35:25,013
So let's go now

553
00:35:25,289 --> 00:35:26,688
That's not that easy

554
00:35:27,024 --> 00:35:28,793
That pill is her wedding gift

555
00:35:28,793 --> 00:35:30,624
She may not even
give it to her dad if he was dying

556
00:35:31,028 --> 00:35:32,052
I can buy it from her

557
00:35:34,232 --> 00:35:35,756
If I was Injured like this..

558
00:35:36,634 --> 00:35:37,566
How much would you pay£¿

559
00:35:39,203 --> 00:35:40,261
100 big dollars

560
00:35:40,972 --> 00:35:41,563
How about him£¿

561
00:35:42,006 --> 00:35:43,234
Any cost

562
00:35:48,646 --> 00:35:50,113
You can't buy it with money

563
00:35:50,648 --> 00:35:51,876
What should we do then£¿

564
00:35:52,183 --> 00:35:53,844
There is only one person who could help you

565
00:35:54,018 --> 00:35:54,609
Who£¿

566
00:35:58,122 --> 00:36:00,056
It's so dangerous here
and you're still bringing this with you£¿

567
00:36:00,825 --> 00:36:01,757
It's a long story

568
00:36:02,727 --> 00:36:03,694
When I having lunch..

569
00:36:04,695 --> 00:36:05,593
Get down

570
00:36:06,264 --> 00:36:06,992
Got it

571
00:36:08,933 --> 00:36:09,834
Grab on tighter

572
00:36:09,834 --> 00:36:10,300
Got it

573
00:36:19,610 --> 00:36:21,737
The one on her chest is the reviving pill

574
00:36:34,625 --> 00:36:35,614
Lower

575
00:36:46,737 --> 00:36:47,294
A bit more

576
00:36:49,307 --> 00:36:50,865
The rope ends here

577
00:36:51,042 --> 00:36:52,009
No more..

578
00:37:02,019 --> 00:37:03,008
Big Trumpet£¬ comedown..

579
00:37:04,188 --> 00:37:05,314
Big Trumpet..

580
00:37:05,990 --> 00:37:06,684
Comedown..

581
00:37:12,830 --> 00:37:13,364
Smart

582
00:37:13,364 --> 00:37:15,389
Go down and get it. Hurry

583
00:37:15,933 --> 00:37:16,297
Go down quickly

584
00:37:27,345 --> 00:37:29,279
Go down immediately. Listen to me

585
00:37:29,747 --> 00:37:31,078
I said go down and get it£¬ asshole

586
00:37:38,222 --> 00:37:39,849
Or I'll beat you!

587
00:37:44,095 --> 00:37:45,062
Spider..

588
00:37:45,062 --> 00:37:47,394
Expert of all clans
and you're afraid of a spider£¿

589
00:37:51,168 --> 00:37:52,135
Don't fool around. Go get it quickly

590
00:37:52,737 --> 00:37:55,072
This way. Stop fooling around

591
00:37:55,072 --> 00:37:55,970
I can't feed you for nothing!

592
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:58,333
Spider..

593
00:37:58,709 --> 00:38:01,007
And you claim you are the expert of all clans.
Yet you are afraid of a spider£¿

594
00:38:05,216 --> 00:38:06,979
Harder£¬ buddy!

595
00:38:08,886 --> 00:38:11,377
Why am I so popular£¿

596
00:38:11,856 --> 00:38:14,188
Because we are too cool

597
00:38:20,097 --> 00:38:21,189
You bastard!

598
00:38:21,299 --> 00:38:23,290
What are you doing here£¿ Trying to kill me£¿

599
00:38:24,268 --> 00:38:25,030
I..

600
00:38:27,271 --> 00:38:28,795
I love you!

601
00:38:36,047 --> 00:38:37,241
I should have noticed

602
00:38:38,049 --> 00:38:40,108
No wonder you come for
Mademoiselle Hong all the time

603
00:38:40,284 --> 00:38:42,844
While you keep your eyes on me

604
00:38:44,155 --> 00:38:45,713
Yes

605
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:48,049
Right. I feel strange£¬ too

606
00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:49,794
I am much more beautiful than Mademoiselle Hong

607
00:38:49,794 --> 00:38:51,455
There is no reason for you
To go after her rather than me

608
00:38:52,430 --> 00:38:54,465
I thought you were insane

609
00:38:54,465 --> 00:38:55,489
That's the actual reason

610
00:38:57,168 --> 00:38:59,261
Yes£¬ I know it's my fault

611
00:38:59,804 --> 00:39:00,905
I know I'm wrong

612
00:39:00,905 --> 00:39:01,972
I can't confront you anymore

613
00:39:01,972 --> 00:39:02,996
I am leaving now

614
00:39:03,174 --> 00:39:04,232
No way

615
00:39:04,875 --> 00:39:07,173
Both you and I will be very sad if that is so

616
00:39:07,978 --> 00:39:09,070
So what should we do£¿

617
00:39:12,216 --> 00:39:13,376
How about from no won..

618
00:39:13,818 --> 00:39:14,978
We have an affair

619
00:39:16,153 --> 00:39:18,155
During daytime£¬ you go dating
with Mademoiselle Hong

620
00:39:18,155 --> 00:39:19,144
At night..

621
00:39:25,262 --> 00:39:26,058
Good idea£¿

622
00:39:26,464 --> 00:39:27,396
Are you happy£¿

623
00:39:27,865 --> 00:39:28,490
Happy

624
00:39:28,966 --> 00:39:29,955
Are you excited£¿

625
00:39:30,234 --> 00:39:31,201
Excited

626
00:39:32,570 --> 00:39:34,060
Such an impartible opponent

627
00:39:34,505 --> 00:39:35,233
Just a kiss!

628
00:39:36,273 --> 00:39:38,138
Sister£¬ how come it is so noisy£¿

629
00:39:38,376 --> 00:39:40,105
What£¿

630
00:39:43,514 --> 00:39:44,446
Little Trumpet£¿

631
00:39:46,951 --> 00:39:47,975
Why are you here£¿

632
00:39:49,253 --> 00:39:50,151
You are such an unlucky guy!

633
00:39:50,588 --> 00:39:51,418
After my sister..

634
00:39:51,856 --> 00:39:52,788
After my sister..

635
00:39:52,990 --> 00:39:57,154
Don't beat him£¬ don't beat him..

636
00:39:57,428 --> 00:39:58,129
Sister

637
00:39:58,129 --> 00:40:00,927
Go to hell!

638
00:40:05,469 --> 00:40:06,404
Sister..

639
00:40:06,404 --> 00:40:07,894
You've beaten Little Trumpet to death

640
00:40:08,339 --> 00:40:09,607
Give me back my Little Trumpet

641
00:40:09,607 --> 00:40:10,972
I don't want to live any more

642
00:40:12,243 --> 00:40:14,578
From no won£¬
I won't allow you two to meet at night

643
00:40:14,578 --> 00:40:15,943
He has to come to my place at night

644
00:40:17,581 --> 00:40:19,483
I mean if he comes to my place

645
00:40:19,483 --> 00:40:21,110
I will beat him to death!

646
00:40:22,353 --> 00:40:23,081
I've got it

647
00:40:29,527 --> 00:40:30,960
Sweetheart!

648
00:40:41,639 --> 00:40:44,208
Hey...are you ok£¿

649
00:40:44,208 --> 00:40:46,277
Ok£¿You may try your self

650
00:40:46,277 --> 00:40:47,608
Hey£¬ how about the pill£¿

651
00:40:48,279 --> 00:40:50,440
It's already very fortunate
that I'm still alive£¬ buddy

652
00:40:50,648 --> 00:40:52,172
That means the lounge lizard would die£¿

653
00:40:52,516 --> 00:40:53,881
Sweetheart!

654
00:40:54,385 --> 00:40:56,046
Hey£¬ hey..

655
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:00,154
What's the matter with him£¿

656
00:41:01,425 --> 00:41:03,461
What's up£¿ His circulation
was disconnected because of the shock

657
00:41:03,461 --> 00:41:04,485
He would definitely die. Look at him

658
00:41:05,930 --> 00:41:08,098
No worries. I have a surviving pill

659
00:41:08,098 --> 00:41:09,087
It can revive him

660
00:41:09,567 --> 00:41:10,301
Bring it back and take it

661
00:41:10,301 --> 00:41:12,069
No way. He needs to take it now

662
00:41:12,069 --> 00:41:13,559
He should be fine after taking it

663
00:41:15,072 --> 00:41:15,561
I'm fine now

664
00:41:15,639 --> 00:41:16,606
That soon£¿

665
00:41:17,174 --> 00:41:18,175
Let's go play soccer

666
00:41:18,175 --> 00:41:19,233
Great         Soccer£¿

667
00:41:19,376 --> 00:41:20,206
Good night

668
00:41:21,445 --> 00:41:23,436
Soccer at this time of the night£¿

669
00:41:33,691 --> 00:41:35,556
He...how come he is still sick£¿

670
00:41:36,627 --> 00:41:37,924
Ok£¬ don't worry and go home

671
00:41:38,095 --> 00:41:39,619
I will return a living man to you tomorrow

672
00:41:46,437 --> 00:41:47,927
Thank you£¬ then

673
00:42:01,385 --> 00:42:03,988
Actually the reviving
pill can only keep him alive

674
00:42:03,988 --> 00:42:05,114
If we want to save him

675
00:42:05,189 --> 00:42:07,453
We need to transfer our energy
to push the poison out from him

676
00:42:08,158 --> 00:42:10,058
Ok£¬ we should finish it off

677
00:42:10,461 --> 00:42:11,428
Let the five of us do it together

678
00:42:11,729 --> 00:42:13,321
Transfer the energy to him
and push the poison out

679
00:42:13,664 --> 00:42:14,688
OK        Come on

680
00:42:15,566 --> 00:42:16,692
Why all of you go behind him£¿

681
00:42:17,067 --> 00:42:18,168
We all small potato

682
00:42:18,168 --> 00:42:20,068
You are the best among us£¬
Of course you do it first

683
00:42:20,337 --> 00:42:21,668
Alright! Fine!

684
00:42:39,523 --> 00:42:42,083
It's already 1 hour and he still not up£¿

685
00:42:42,393 --> 00:42:44,662
Maybe I am not feeling quite well these days£¬
Cannot concentrate at all

686
00:42:44,662 --> 00:42:45,696
How about finding someone to replace me£¿

687
00:42:45,696 --> 00:42:47,254
Chanting Bing and Little Trumpet£¬
Come and replace me

688
00:42:47,631 --> 00:42:49,428
You are a trouble maker

689
00:42:49,633 --> 00:42:51,601
I already really hurt!      That's for you

690
00:43:11,021 --> 00:43:14,013
It's already two hours£¬
did you guys do your best£¿

691
00:43:14,224 --> 00:43:15,326
I should use my left hand

692
00:43:15,326 --> 00:43:15,724
I am right handed

693
00:43:16,126 --> 00:43:17,093
Let me do it

694
00:43:17,795 --> 00:43:18,696
How about me£¿

695
00:43:18,696 --> 00:43:20,596
You come here then     Alright

696
00:43:21,231 --> 00:43:22,391
Let me do it

697
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:32,071
You bastard

698
00:43:35,379 --> 00:43:36,209
What's going on£¿

699
00:43:36,413 --> 00:43:37,710
Concentrate!

700
00:43:43,053 --> 00:43:45,419
Mannie£¬ actually I like you a lot

701
00:43:45,656 --> 00:43:47,521
But I am a very shy person

702
00:43:47,725 --> 00:43:49,352
I don't know how to confess my love to you

703
00:43:49,727 --> 00:43:52,093
I am old and I don't have much money

704
00:43:52,429 --> 00:43:54,192
I could only treat you nicely from my heart

705
00:43:54,598 --> 00:43:57,260
I don't mind that
you are the lady boss of a brothel

706
00:43:57,568 --> 00:44:00,435
I hope you also don't mind that I am old

707
00:44:01,105 --> 00:44:02,470
After you finish reading this letter

708
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:04,808
If you don't like it just throw it away

709
00:44:04,808 --> 00:44:07,504
If you like it£¬ you may show me some signs

710
00:44:08,178 --> 00:44:11,079
Always love you£¬ Chanting Bing

711
00:44:20,457 --> 00:44:22,823
Do they know that
I am writing a letter to Miss Manuelle£¿

712
00:44:24,762 --> 00:44:26,730
Chanting Bing£¬ I have something to tell you

713
00:44:28,599 --> 00:44:30,157
Acting strangely

714
00:44:33,103 --> 00:44:34,434
Why are you crying£¿

715
00:44:34,805 --> 00:44:38,104
I noticed how Cheryl looked at Tony Luo

716
00:44:38,342 --> 00:44:41,675
I know I don't have any hope

717
00:44:43,180 --> 00:44:44,481
When you like a girl

718
00:44:44,481 --> 00:44:46,779
Do you want her to be happy
Or do you want yourself to be happy£¿

719
00:44:47,618 --> 00:44:48,607
Her

720
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:50,544
You've saved the life of that handsome

721
00:44:50,654 --> 00:44:52,519
Cheryl must be very happy

722
00:44:53,290 --> 00:44:53,722
Really£¿

723
00:44:54,158 --> 00:44:56,353
But what about me£¿

724
00:44:58,829 --> 00:45:00,854
Stop crying£¬ would you£¿

725
00:45:01,331 --> 00:45:03,822
Cry...you make me wanna cry£¬ too

726
00:45:05,135 --> 00:45:06,770
I need to face Mademoiselle Hong and Madonna

727
00:45:06,770 --> 00:45:08,863
I don't know what to do

728
00:45:19,683 --> 00:45:22,584
I wanna ask the world what love is

729
00:45:31,528 --> 00:45:32,290
Miss

730
00:45:32,429 --> 00:45:33,896
You haven't returned home for the whole night.
Where were you£¿

731
00:45:34,498 --> 00:45:35,833
We all are so worried

732
00:45:35,833 --> 00:45:36,527
Where is dad£¿

733
00:45:37,267 --> 00:45:38,393
He is meeting a guest in the study room

734
00:45:47,544 --> 00:45:48,238
Dad

735
00:45:48,712 --> 00:45:49,838
How come you didn't...          This is£¿

736
00:45:50,581 --> 00:45:52,310
She is my daughter. She's called Cheryl

737
00:45:56,820 --> 00:45:58,913
You are as pretty as your mother

738
00:45:59,556 --> 00:46:00,224
And this is£¿

739
00:46:00,224 --> 00:46:01,816
I am the daughter of Nie Town mayor

740
00:46:02,459 --> 00:46:03,721
There are a lot of bandits There

741
00:46:04,495 --> 00:46:06,725
I specially come here
To ask your dad to assist us

742
00:46:06,964 --> 00:46:08,158
You go to the kitchen first

743
00:46:08,465 --> 00:46:09,864
I will come and cook with you later

744
00:46:10,667 --> 00:46:11,361
Ok

745
00:46:14,838 --> 00:46:17,170
You have a good relationship with your daughter

746
00:46:17,975 --> 00:46:21,308
Little Trumpet said£¬
Cheryl will be happy if I save that guy

747
00:46:21,612 --> 00:46:23,477
If Cheryl is happy£¬ I am happy

748
00:46:24,448 --> 00:46:26,609
But why am I so sad now£¿

749
00:46:28,485 --> 00:46:32,285
Losing someone whom I love is so painful

750
00:46:34,892 --> 00:46:37,292
Do you think you are the only one suffering£¿

751
00:46:38,395 --> 00:46:40,420
You are the only one that lost your love£¿

752
00:46:41,632 --> 00:46:43,725
What do you know£¿ Have you ever been In love£¿

753
00:46:44,334 --> 00:46:47,201
I've lost my love so many times

754
00:46:47,871 --> 00:46:48,895
I can tell

755
00:46:49,406 --> 00:46:50,407
When I was young

756
00:46:50,407 --> 00:46:52,773
There were endless beauties who were so Into me

757
00:46:53,277 --> 00:46:56,440
They also gave me a nickname£¬ Handsome Tsoi

758
00:46:56,647 --> 00:46:58,547
How can they tell such a lie£¿

759
00:46:59,216 --> 00:47:01,912
Then I retired from the Jianghu and came here

760
00:47:02,286 --> 00:47:04,777
I found the love of my life

761
00:47:05,656 --> 00:47:06,884
Who£¿

762
00:47:07,424 --> 00:47:08,659
Tell me

763
00:47:08,659 --> 00:47:10,727
It is..

764
00:47:10,727 --> 00:47:11,921
My Mannie

765
00:47:13,330 --> 00:47:14,888
Miss Manuelle£¿

766
00:47:15,365 --> 00:47:16,696
But I am poor

767
00:47:16,934 --> 00:47:18,367
I'm not good enough for her

768
00:47:19,336 --> 00:47:20,894
Have you confessed your love to her£¿

769
00:47:22,005 --> 00:47:24,735
I'm so afraid that
She will turn me down once again

770
00:47:25,909 --> 00:47:27,845
No courage at all

771
00:47:27,845 --> 00:47:28,573
How about you£¿

772
00:47:28,645 --> 00:47:31,375
Why don't you go to tell Cheryl
That you love her£¿

773
00:47:31,849 --> 00:47:34,283
I'm so afraid that
she'll turn me down on the site

774
00:47:35,552 --> 00:47:38,851
Both of us had lost our love

775
00:47:41,391 --> 00:47:42,915
Losing someone's love is so painful

776
00:47:43,460 --> 00:47:44,484
You better kill me

777
00:47:44,561 --> 00:47:46,358
You kill me first and I'll then kill you

778
00:47:46,563 --> 00:47:47,894
If I've killed you£¬ how could you kill me

779
00:47:48,665 --> 00:47:50,656
Let's think of away to die together

780
00:47:50,868 --> 00:47:52,536
Good. Let's go to your home for a meeting

781
00:47:52,536 --> 00:47:53,002
Good

782
00:47:55,005 --> 00:47:58,998
Tony Luo..

783
00:48:07,851 --> 00:48:08,749
Handsome

784
00:48:09,386 --> 00:48:10,478
It's dark already

785
00:48:10,721 --> 00:48:13,423
We have nice wine and nice cuisine£¬
We also have pretties to visit your room

786
00:48:13,423 --> 00:48:14,447
Are you coming up£¿

787
00:48:14,625 --> 00:48:16,426
No thanks. But I want to get some Information

788
00:48:16,426 --> 00:48:18,328
Did four men walk pass here3 days ago

789
00:48:18,328 --> 00:48:19,022
Saying that they are going to Tiger Den£¿

790
00:48:19,363 --> 00:48:20,497
We don't know

791
00:48:20,497 --> 00:48:22,488
But we can ask for you

792
00:48:22,699 --> 00:48:24,801
Mannie...There is a man down There

793
00:48:24,801 --> 00:48:27,429
asking aboutthe4 men
who were going to Tiger Den 3 days ago

794
00:48:27,537 --> 00:48:28,504
Could they be his friend£¿

795
00:48:29,006 --> 00:48:29,973
Be careful

796
00:48:30,440 --> 00:48:31,842
If they are people from Tiger Den

797
00:48:31,842 --> 00:48:33,639
They would pretend that they are his friend

798
00:48:33,777 --> 00:48:35,472
But he is so handsome.
He doesn't look like a bad guy

799
00:48:35,913 --> 00:48:38,541
Have you had enough
that men keep taking advantage of you£¿

800
00:48:43,754 --> 00:48:47,053
Where does this handsome come from£¿

801
00:48:47,357 --> 00:48:48,688
I just want to lookfor4friends of mine

802
00:48:49,092 --> 00:48:51,128
I haven't seen 4 friends

803
00:48:51,128 --> 00:48:53,096
But we have4 pretties here

804
00:48:53,697 --> 00:48:56,530
I would suggest you to stay here
and get the Information

805
00:48:56,733 --> 00:48:58,568
Maybe you'll get some Information

806
00:48:58,568 --> 00:49:00,593
Don't worry.
I will seek for the Information myself

807
00:49:01,805 --> 00:49:02,533
Let's go

808
00:49:06,009 --> 00:49:08,946
I'll use this one. This one it is.
To pierce through your lung

809
00:49:08,946 --> 00:49:10,847
I'll use this one to pierce
through your bladder

810
00:49:10,847 --> 00:49:13,550
I'll use this one to cut your aorta

811
00:49:13,550 --> 00:49:15,519
I'll use this one to cut your Intestines

812
00:49:15,519 --> 00:49:16,383
We'll die for sure

813
00:49:16,820 --> 00:49:18,412
Yes£¬ we must be able to die
Able to die

814
00:49:21,024 --> 00:49:22,651
Step back

815
00:49:56,159 --> 00:49:57,387
Even the ants will manage to survive

816
00:49:57,761 --> 00:49:59,490
Why are the two of you committing suicide£¿

817
00:50:01,732 --> 00:50:03,033
It's none of your business

818
00:50:03,033 --> 00:50:04,201
Did we say that we are committing suicide£¿

819
00:50:04,201 --> 00:50:05,035
No

820
00:50:05,035 --> 00:50:05,524
That's it

821
00:50:05,736 --> 00:50:06,837
But your bodies are equipped with..

822
00:50:06,837 --> 00:50:07,604
Can we just play£¿

823
00:50:07,604 --> 00:50:08,472
Sharp weapons..

824
00:50:08,472 --> 00:50:08,905
Have you ever had Western£¿

825
00:50:08,905 --> 00:50:10,574
Are you from the rural areas£¿
Have you tried steak before£¿

826
00:50:10,574 --> 00:50:11,063
Move!

827
00:50:18,181 --> 00:50:19,773
Are you here to help out again£¿

828
00:50:19,916 --> 00:50:20,884
Yes

829
00:50:20,884 --> 00:50:22,943
But you need to pay me

830
00:50:24,121 --> 00:50:24,815
What is this kid doing here£¿

831
00:50:27,057 --> 00:50:28,786
He was peeping when we were in the shower

832
00:50:28,925 --> 00:50:29,949
Don't misunderstand me£¬ seniors

833
00:50:30,460 --> 00:50:31,950
I am just looking for my friends
Who are missing

834
00:50:32,162 --> 00:50:33,493
If I made you mad

835
00:50:33,730 --> 00:50:34,822
Please accept my apology

836
00:50:34,998 --> 00:50:35,794
Young guy

837
00:50:36,566 --> 00:50:38,727
Lucky Star Town won't be bullied

838
00:50:38,969 --> 00:50:40,459
Yet they don't bully others

839
00:50:40,804 --> 00:50:41,463
Just go

840
00:50:43,073 --> 00:50:43,937
See you later

841
00:50:45,075 --> 00:50:47,244
Manysons£¬ why did you let him go£¿

842
00:50:47,244 --> 00:50:48,541
I haven't fought enough yet

843
00:50:48,812 --> 00:50:49,836
Did he really peep when you were showing£¿

844
00:50:51,014 --> 00:50:51,673
Yes!

845
00:50:51,982 --> 00:50:53,916
I am asking why the two of you
were having a shower together

846
00:50:54,084 --> 00:50:55,517
We save water

847
00:50:55,819 --> 00:50:57,480
Save water£¿

848
00:50:59,222 --> 00:51:00,655
Disgusting

849
00:51:00,891 --> 00:51:03,126
Miss Manuelle...you've misunderstood..

850
00:51:03,126 --> 00:51:03,820
Miss Manuelle!

851
00:51:05,195 --> 00:51:07,459
Why can't we die£¿

852
00:51:10,667 --> 00:51:14,068
Xing's wife.
How come dad hasn't come down for meal£¿

853
00:51:14,604 --> 00:51:15,571
Just wait for some awhile

854
00:51:15,839 --> 00:51:18,205
He is chatting with Miss Nie upstairs

855
00:51:19,109 --> 00:51:20,811
That much food that I've made

856
00:51:20,811 --> 00:51:21,971
Do I have to eat by myself£¿

857
00:51:26,183 --> 00:51:27,775
I can't drink anymore

858
00:51:28,985 --> 00:51:29,815
That soon£¿

859
00:51:30,520 --> 00:51:31,885
General£¬ you are good at drinking

860
00:51:32,689 --> 00:51:33,986
What is this£¿

861
00:51:41,231 --> 00:51:42,255
Shall we dance

862
00:51:43,700 --> 00:51:44,826
I don't know how to dance

863
00:51:45,102 --> 00:51:47,502
Let me teach you. Give me your hand

864
00:52:05,889 --> 00:52:06,289
You..

865
00:52:06,289 --> 00:52:08,018
This is the poison Injection
That anesthetizes your nerves

866
00:52:08,291 --> 00:52:09,781
The effects will be apparent very soon

867
00:52:12,596 --> 00:52:13,927
It's useless even you've picked it out

868
00:52:15,665 --> 00:52:18,031
You'll listen to me very soon

869
00:52:31,681 --> 00:52:31,976
General!

870
00:52:35,952 --> 00:52:37,214
Team Leader Zhu£¬ you want to revolt£¿

871
00:52:38,755 --> 00:52:39,779
You are right

872
00:52:40,157 --> 00:52:42,182
Team Leader Zhu is on my side long time ago

873
00:52:44,161 --> 00:52:44,684
Dad!

874
00:52:56,006 --> 00:52:56,665
Push the cabinet away

875
00:53:06,983 --> 00:53:07,584
Dad

876
00:53:07,584 --> 00:53:08,073
Go quickly!

877
00:53:23,633 --> 00:53:24,156
Give way!

878
00:53:33,977 --> 00:53:34,875
Xing's wife. Go after her!

879
00:53:35,078 --> 00:53:36,170
Yes£¬ Miss Kurosawa Kiyoko

880
00:53:50,794 --> 00:53:53,729
Those people In the Lucky Star Town
are all KungFu experts

881
00:53:54,197 --> 00:53:56,165
How come all of them take things lightly£¿

882
00:53:56,967 --> 00:53:58,127
As they have good kungfu

883
00:53:58,368 --> 00:54:00,996
How come they are willing
To stay In a small town like this

884
00:54:01,905 --> 00:54:03,395
Are they lackeys of the Japanese£¿

885
00:54:15,418 --> 00:54:16,180
Be careful!

886
00:54:36,106 --> 00:54:37,437
Let me go...       Don't move!

887
00:55:22,519 --> 00:55:23,315
Miss

888
00:55:24,220 --> 00:55:26,017
Miss..

889
00:55:32,629 --> 00:55:33,527
Are you ok£¿

890
00:55:36,299 --> 00:55:37,027
Thank you

891
00:55:37,467 --> 00:55:38,335
What is your name£¿

892
00:55:38,335 --> 00:55:39,029
My name is Tony Luo

893
00:55:39,402 --> 00:55:40,391
Your name is Tony Luo£¿

894
00:55:41,037 --> 00:55:42,402
I know Tony Luo

Have you met them£¿

896
00:55:45,008 --> 00:55:47,568
He was hurt. I've sent him
to Luck Star Town to be healed

897
00:55:48,211 --> 00:55:49,312
Lucky Star Town£¿

898
00:55:49,312 --> 00:55:51,177
You would know if we go
to Lucky Star Town and check it out

899
00:55:53,083 --> 00:55:53,481
Ok

900
00:55:54,517 --> 00:55:58,088
Honey..

901
00:55:58,088 --> 00:55:59,522
You said you were going to date me

902
00:55:59,522 --> 00:56:01,114
I couldn't find you all over the town

903
00:56:01,491 --> 00:56:05,552
Honey..

904
00:56:09,099 --> 00:56:10,589
Shit£¬ I can't continue on like this

905
00:56:32,055 --> 00:56:32,384
Mademoiselle Hong

906
00:56:32,489 --> 00:56:33,387
We've already closed

907
00:56:33,490 --> 00:56:34,149
Mademoiselle Hong

908
00:56:35,992 --> 00:56:36,424
You..

909
00:56:37,927 --> 00:56:38,325
It's me

910
00:56:39,963 --> 00:56:40,657
Turn around

911
00:56:42,065 --> 00:56:44,499
Little Tailor£¬ my cousin is here to visit me

912

Go!

913

Why are you dressed like this£¿

914

Your sister has been looking for me£¬
Saying we..

915
00:56:58,081 --> 00:56:59,912
I don't care. I have to tell my sister

916
00:57:00,049 --> 00:57:00,538
I have to marry you

917
00:57:02,352 --> 00:57:03,148
What is it£¿Why it so hard£¿

918
00:57:03,620 --> 00:57:04,245
A bowl

00:57:11,528 --> 00:57:12,324
Quick

923
00:57:13,229 --> 00:57:13,991
Hide In the jar

924
00:57:14,597 --> 00:57:15,461
Don't throw away your shoes

925
00:57:17,467 --> 00:57:18,297
I'm so angry

926
00:57:21,237 --> 00:57:22,261
That bastard..

927
00:57:24,040 --> 00:57:24,438
Sister

928
00:57:25,241 --> 00:57:26,606
Why are you still up at this time of the night£¿

929
00:57:26,743 --> 00:57:27,573
What are you doing£¿

930
00:57:27,677 --> 00:57:29,304
I...am playing hide and seek

931
00:57:29,379 --> 00:57:30,038
With who£¿

932
00:57:30,413 --> 00:57:31,004
Little Trumpet

933
00:57:31,114 --> 00:57:32,012
Little Trumpet£¿

934
00:57:32,215 --> 00:57:32,681
Is he here£¿

935
00:57:33,116 --> 00:57:34,083
No           Where is he£¿

Sister...I'm not sure where he is

938
00:57:36,719 --> 00:57:38,354
Has he gone out already£¿

939
00:57:38,354 --> 00:57:39,013
Don't worry about him

940
00:57:41,858 --> 00:57:43,018
Why£¿

941
00:57:43,393 --> 00:57:46,658
Why don't you let me die when I want to£¿

942
00:57:54,037 --> 00:57:55,231
Little Trumpet£¬ you may come out

Mademoiselle Hong£¿

What's up£¿

947
00:58:05,849 --> 00:58:07,146
As I treat you as sister

948
00:58:07,717 --> 00:58:08,775
I have a secret to tell you

949
00:58:08,952 --> 00:58:09,782
You have to keep this secret for me

950
00:58:10,153 --> 00:58:11,177
I am good at keeping secrets

951
00:58:11,387 --> 00:58:13,022
Chanting Bing peeped when you were showering
and Miss Manuelle stole your abalone

952
00:58:13,022 --> 00:58:14,250
Little Tailor said your figure is poor
when he made your clothes

953
00:58:14,390 --> 00:58:15,220
Did I tell you all this£¿

954
00:58:15,391 --> 00:58:16,259
You are really good at keeping secrets

00:58:21,664 --> 00:58:22,153
but I haven't..

958
00:58:22,732 --> 00:58:23,357
been kissed

959
00:58:25,168 --> 00:58:26,294
I want you to teach me

960
00:58:28,438 --> 00:58:29,166
Now£¿

961
00:58:29,772 --> 00:58:30,170
Buddy!

962
00:58:30,440 --> 00:58:31,998
I have never thought of trying it with you

963
00:58:32,442 --> 00:58:33,409
So what do you really want£¿

964
00:58:34,177 --> 00:58:37,112
To tell the truth£¬

00:58:40,717 --> 00:58:41,342
So what is it£¿

968
00:58:41,918 --> 00:58:44,648
I don't want Little Trumpet to know that
I don't have this kind of experience

969
00:58:44,821 --> 00:58:45,655
Teach me

970
00:58:45,655 --> 00:58:46,349
Obviously you don't read books

971
00:58:46,756 --> 00:58:47,814
The Dream of the Red Chamber had Taught

972
00:58:47,991 --> 00:58:49,117
The best thing it described is...what is it£¿

973
00:58:49,192 --> 00:58:51,854
Don't move if it's immoral£¬ don't look
if it's immoral£¬ don't say if it's immoral

974
00:58:52,328 --> 00:58:52,919
I don't get it

975
00:58:53,229 --> 00:58:53,930
Move your lips here. Let mete ach you

976
00:58:53,930 --> 00:58:55,164
Wow£¬ you are taking advantage then

977
00:58:55,164 --> 00:58:56,654
You'll take my first kiss. No way

978
00:58:56,933 --> 00:58:58,867
Sodo you have paper£¿We can put a piece
of paper In between so it doesn't count

979
00:58:59,302 --> 00:59:00,103
Do you have paper£¿

980
00:59:00,103 --> 00:59:00,762
Yes

981
00:59:04,307 --> 00:59:06,798
Don't move if it's immoral means
when he wants to kiss you

982
00:59:06,943 --> 00:59:08,205
You pout and stop moving

983
00:59:08,778 --> 00:59:10,079
Don't look if it's immoral means..

984
00:59:10,079 --> 00:59:11,910
You close your eyes and enjoy the process

985
00:59:12,115 --> 00:59:12,979
Then£¬ don't say when it's immoral..

986
00:59:13,149 --> 00:59:15,242
doesn't mean not to speak.
It means you speak while you pout

987
00:59:17,020 --> 00:59:19,011
The happiest moment is to write with him

988
00:59:19,188 --> 00:59:20,985
Not with your hand but by your tongue

989
00:59:21,090 --> 00:59:22,785
You write to him and he writes to you

990
00:59:27,897 --> 00:59:28,727
Like that£¿

991
00:59:29,165 --> 00:59:31,000
You can write like that. Are you human£¿

992
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:33,025
I love you so much

993
00:59:37,106 --> 00:59:37,868
Mademoiselle Hong

994

Mademoiselle Hong..

995
00:59:49,352 --> 00:59:50,341
To be a bad guy£¿

996
00:59:55,325 --> 00:59:57,427
Mademoiselle Hong£¬ I'm hungry

997
00:59:57,427 --> 00:59:58,223
Auntie£¬ what are you doing here£¿

998
00:59:58,828 --> 01:00:00,318
It's me£¬ Little Trumpet

999
01:00:01,130 --> 01:00:02,119
Little Trumpet£¿

1000
01:00:02,432 --> 01:00:03,023
Keep quiet!

1001
01:00:03,433 --> 01:00:04,161
Look at this

1002
01:00:05,234 --> 01:00:08,294
I want to be a bad guy She is dead

1003
01:00:09,238 --> 01:00:10,306
Something big is happening!

1004
01:00:10,306 --> 01:00:11,000
What£¿

1005
01:00:14,310 --> 01:00:15,174
And

1006
01:00:17,814 --> 01:00:19,975
I removed her first piece of clothing In here

1007
01:00:20,783 --> 01:00:21,215
Go!

1008
01:00:22,986 --> 01:00:24,010
And then            and

1009
01:00:26,756 --> 01:00:28,280
She has no clothes left on any more

1010
01:00:28,891 --> 01:00:30,290
She has nothing left on!

1011
01:00:32,428 --> 01:00:34,896
She has put her clothes back on

1012
01:00:35,231 --> 01:00:36,129
So..

1013
01:00:38,001 --> 01:00:39,195
And then..

1014
01:00:40,536 --> 01:00:42,338
Mademoiselle Hong..

1015
01:00:42,338 --> 01:00:44,101
Is everything ok£¿ If so£¬ get up

1016
01:00:44,207 --> 01:00:45,799
It's fine. Let's go home

1017
01:00:45,875 --> 01:00:46,466
Let's go home

1018
01:00:47,143 --> 01:00:47,877
What had happened£¿

1019
01:00:47,877 --> 01:00:50,072
I'll organize a wedding banquet
For you two tomorrow

1020
01:00:50,346 --> 01:00:52,109
Grown up men and women should get married

1021
01:00:52,415 --> 01:00:54,178
You just need to complete the registration

1022
01:00:54,550 --> 01:00:56,780
Sister£¬ why are you acting so strangely£¿

1023
01:00:57,020 --> 01:00:59,352
Nothing. She had promised our marriage

1024
01:00:59,789 --> 01:01:00,255
Really£¿

1025
01:01:00,490 --> 01:01:02,185
We should be happy as she promised our marriage

1026
01:01:02,458 --> 01:01:03,292
Why are you so Intense

1027
01:01:03,292 --> 01:01:05,089
I'm very excited

1028
01:01:07,397 --> 01:01:08,227
You two..

1029
01:01:08,931 --> 01:01:09,522
Little Tailor..

1030
01:01:10,166 --> 01:01:10,996
This alley..

1031
01:01:11,434 --> 01:01:12,025
I..

1032
01:01:54,377 --> 01:01:55,241
Good bye

1033
01:01:55,411 --> 01:01:58,141
Poor guy that can't get a girl

1034
01:02:06,923 --> 01:02:08,049
Wait

1035
01:02:08,224 --> 01:02:09,589
Glad that I could stop

1036
01:02:10,226 --> 01:02:11,318
But I couldn't

1037
01:02:11,527 --> 01:02:12,357
Me neither

1038
01:02:16,499 --> 01:02:17,989
Sister£¬ are you ok£¿

1039
01:02:18,067 --> 01:02:18,634
My butt hurts!

1040
01:02:18,634 --> 01:02:19,569
Are you ok£¿

1041
01:02:19,569 --> 01:02:20,399
Sister!

1042
01:02:23,506 --> 01:02:26,202
Why don't you let me die£¿

1043
01:02:26,876 --> 01:02:27,900
You shouldn't die like this

1044
01:02:28,044 --> 01:02:29,477
Yes£¬ you are such an idiot

1045
01:02:30,847 --> 01:02:33,042
Little Tailor£¬ why are you hanging There£¿

1046
01:02:33,182 --> 01:02:33,876
To grow taller

1047
01:02:34,150 --> 01:02:35,242
Don't you think I've become taller

1048
01:02:36,419 --> 01:02:37,477
You bastard

1049
01:02:37,854 --> 01:02:39,378
Why are you back after
you have peeped us showering£¿

1050
01:02:40,056 --> 01:02:41,546
Senior£¬ no more joke£¬ please

1051
01:02:42,024 --> 01:02:42,854
I am Tony Luo

1052
01:02:43,059 --> 01:02:44,390
I just want to look for my lost friends

1053
01:02:45,061 --> 01:02:46,961
I mean no harm. You can rest as sure of that

1054
01:02:47,163 --> 01:02:49,365
He is a good guy. He just saved me

1055
01:02:49,365 --> 01:02:50,525
Who dares to harm you£¿

1056
01:02:50,633 --> 01:02:51,429
Japan Ninjas

1057
01:02:51,667 --> 01:02:53,032
and people from Tiger Den

1058
01:02:53,469 --> 01:02:54,595
They had grabbed my dad

1059
01:03:02,478 --> 01:03:03,968
Where am I£¿

1060
01:03:04,380 --> 01:03:05,244
You are beside me

1061
01:03:08,050 --> 01:03:08,948
Tony Luo£¿

1062
01:03:10,553 --> 01:03:12,180
Am I dreaming£¿

1063
01:03:21,364 --> 01:03:22,092
You've hugged the wrong person

1064
01:03:23,065 --> 01:03:24,032
She is here

1065
01:03:30,106 --> 01:03:31,630
What did I do wrong£¿

1066
01:03:33,309 --> 01:03:34,037
Tony

1067
01:03:36,646 --> 01:03:39,342
Howard Luo and them£¬
they...sacrificed themselves

1068
01:03:41,050 --> 01:03:43,541
However£¬ we've looted a list of Japanese spies

1069
01:03:46,389 --> 01:03:47,583
The Tiger Den became traitors

1070
01:03:48,057 --> 01:03:49,991
Even Warlord Lin is In the Japanese's hand

1071
01:03:50,159 --> 01:03:50,921
How do you know£¿

1072
01:03:51,194 --> 01:03:53,128
The Japanese Ninjas were after Cheryl
And wanted to kill her just now

1073
01:03:53,396 --> 01:03:54,158
Fortunately she ran Into me

1074
01:03:54,497 --> 01:03:56,965
But why did she cry and leave the moment

1075
01:03:57,033 --> 01:03:58,523
She saw us£¿

1076
01:03:59,202 --> 01:04:00,100
She likes you

1077
01:04:00,236 --> 01:04:01,134
She likes me£¿

1078
01:04:01,437 --> 01:04:02,631
She thought you were a man

1079
01:04:09,612 --> 01:04:10,544
Miss Cheryl

1080
01:04:12,982 --> 01:04:14,540
I actually thought she is a man

1081
01:04:18,020 --> 01:04:19,385
Am I as stupid as a pig£¿

1082
01:04:19,622 --> 01:04:20,611
Do you want to hear the truth£¿

1083
01:04:21,290 --> 01:04:22,257
Not now

1084
01:04:22,391 --> 01:04:24,689
Actually you are the smartest girl
I've ever met

1085
01:04:31,734 --> 01:04:33,531
It doesn't matter if I am a man or a woman

1086
01:04:34,270 --> 01:04:36,397
You should worry about your dad's safety first

1087
01:04:37,006 --> 01:04:37,495
You are right

1088
01:04:37,707 --> 01:04:39,299
Dad was grabbed by that evil woman

1089
01:04:39,609 --> 01:04:40,667
We gotta save him

1090
01:04:42,078 --> 01:04:44,444
It hurts...my shoulder..

1091
01:04:44,647 --> 01:04:47,309
It really hurts...Help
Are you feeling better£¿

1092
01:04:48,451 --> 01:04:49,247
Gently

1093
01:04:49,318 --> 01:04:50,386
All seniors       It really hurts

1094
01:04:50,386 --> 01:04:51,717
You all have good kungfu

1095
01:04:52,521 --> 01:04:53,351
If we could work together

1096
01:04:53,756 --> 01:04:54,950
We need not be afraid of them

1097
01:04:55,057 --> 01:04:56,319
It's not that we don't want to help you

1098
01:04:57,059 --> 01:04:59,425
The problem is that everyone
of us had our own sorrow history

1099
01:04:59,662 --> 01:05:01,357
We want to have a peaceful life now

1100
01:05:01,631 --> 01:05:03,326
Therefore we retire In Lucky Star Town

1101
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:05,524
If we help you

1102
01:05:06,102 --> 01:05:07,091
It will become restless

1103
01:05:07,603 --> 01:05:09,730
Lucky Star Town will no longer be a fairyland

1104
01:05:11,707 --> 01:05:13,538
Yes£¬ just go

1105
01:05:16,078 --> 01:05:16,669
Miss Kurosawa

1106
01:05:17,346 --> 01:05:19,143
What happens Inside the military camp

1107
01:05:19,515 --> 01:05:21,176
General hasn't come out for few days

1108
01:05:21,284 --> 01:05:23,980
They have started to suspect us down There.
I can't hold any longer

1109
01:05:24,287 --> 01:05:26,448
Help me and General arrange a wedding

1110
01:05:27,256 --> 01:05:27,722
Wedding£¿

1111
01:05:28,391 --> 01:05:30,689
My soul transfer magic
had already controlled his behavior

1112
01:05:31,661 --> 01:05:33,458
However this guy has a strong will

1113
01:05:34,130 --> 01:05:35,597
I can't make him surrender

1114
01:05:36,065 --> 01:05:38,033
Just wait and see what I would do

1115
01:05:38,234 --> 01:05:38,723
But

1116
01:05:39,302 --> 01:05:41,270
We haven't found his daughter£¬ Cheryl Lin£¬ yet

1117
01:05:41,671 --> 01:05:42,433
What if she..

1118
01:05:42,605 --> 01:05:44,072
She is In Lucky Star Town

1119
01:05:56,752 --> 01:05:58,413
You guys£¬ we're really sorry

1120
01:05:58,721 --> 01:06:00,484
In order to keep
our Lucky Star Town safe and well

1121
01:06:01,190 --> 01:06:02,487
We really can't be Involved in this

1122
01:06:02,758 --> 01:06:03,417
I hope you understand

1123
01:06:03,592 --> 01:06:04,354
No problem

1124
01:06:04,827 --> 01:06:06,294
I know everyone treats me nicely

1125
01:06:06,662 --> 01:06:08,254
I can't force you£¬ right

1126
01:06:08,431 --> 01:06:09,125
Cheryl

1127
01:06:09,732 --> 01:06:12,098
You father will have a wedding party
with Nie WuShuang this afternoon

1128
01:06:12,435 --> 01:06:13,129
We should go first

1129
01:06:14,270 --> 01:06:15,794
Everyone£¬ see you later

1130
01:06:16,305 --> 01:06:17,169
See you later

1131
01:06:17,473 --> 01:06:18,371
No!

1132
01:06:19,442 --> 01:06:20,602
I can't stand by and watch

1133
01:06:21,243 --> 01:06:22,232
I have to go with you

1134
01:06:23,112 --> 01:06:25,281
If you go£¬ it means that we are all Involved

1135
01:06:25,281 --> 01:06:26,282
You can't be that selfish

1136
01:06:26,282 --> 01:06:26,748
You can't

1137
01:06:29,051 --> 01:06:30,211
Am I that useless£¿

1138
01:06:30,786 --> 01:06:32,253
Do you want to hear the truth£¿

1139
01:06:33,055 --> 01:06:33,783
Not too true

1140
01:06:36,325 --> 01:06:38,418
In my heart£¬ you are really a good guy

1141
01:06:47,770 --> 01:06:49,101
You don't have to leave

1142
01:06:50,106 --> 01:06:50,765
They are£¿

1143
01:06:54,443 --> 01:06:55,705
18 Silver Evils of Black Storm Fenced Hamlet

1144
01:06:56,112 --> 01:06:56,601
Who are they£¿

1145
01:06:56,746 --> 01:06:58,407
They are the most expensive killing machines

1146
01:06:59,081 --> 01:07:01,106
They had a special offer recently
To celebrate their20th anniversary

1147
01:07:01,517 --> 01:07:03,747
They can kill the whole family
If you hire them to kill one of them

1148
01:07:03,819 --> 01:07:06,344
If you payfor3£¬
They can kill all the people In the village

1149
01:07:06,522 --> 01:07:09,184
By Instance they have a special offer this week£¬
So they are especially harsh on killing

1150
01:07:09,358 --> 01:07:10,347
Everyone be careful

1151
01:07:11,360 --> 01:07:11,792
Little Tailor..

1152
01:07:12,428 --> 01:07:12,757
Go!

1153
01:07:22,438 --> 01:07:23,302
We rush out together

1154
01:07:23,406 --> 01:07:24,566
I'll block them here

1155
01:07:25,274 --> 01:07:26,172
You bring Cheryl with you

1156
01:07:26,242 --> 01:07:27,368
As well as the spy list

1157
01:07:28,277 --> 01:07:28,800
No way..

1158
01:07:29,245 --> 01:07:29,802
We have to go together

1159
01:07:29,879 --> 01:07:31,744
I am not your fianc¨¦  now£¬ I am your senior

1160
01:07:32,214 --> 01:07:33,078
This is an order!

1161
01:07:37,520 --> 01:07:38,350
Go!

1162
01:07:43,392 --> 01:07:43,756
Come with me

1163
01:07:53,803 --> 01:07:54,735
So great

1164
01:07:55,171 --> 01:07:56,229
Who are they£¿

1165
01:07:56,439 --> 01:07:57,906
The 18 Horny Evils of Black Storm Fence Hamlet

1166
01:07:58,441 --> 01:08:00,636
No£¬ 18 Silver Evils

1167
01:08:00,743 --> 01:08:02,802
They are the broadsword team
that had killed more than 200 people

1168
01:08:03,879 --> 01:08:05,403
18 Silver Evils

1169
01:08:06,148 --> 01:08:07,547
How can we beat them£¿

1170
01:08:09,518 --> 01:08:10,450
Don't be silly

1171
01:08:11,187 --> 01:08:12,552
Do you know if you go out like that

1172
01:08:12,822 --> 01:08:15,154
you'll embroil those Innocent common people

1173
01:08:15,357 --> 01:08:17,188
Let me go out

1174
01:08:49,258 --> 01:08:50,247
We've thought it through

1175
01:08:50,392 --> 01:08:52,417
Jianghu is actually not the place around£¬
it's Inside our heart

1176
01:08:52,795 --> 01:08:53,853
So we cannot retire

1177
01:09:38,574 --> 01:09:39,541
Hey! Come back!

1178
01:09:44,580 --> 01:09:46,878
It's so tough that we can't beat through

1179
01:09:47,349 --> 01:09:48,976
They are too sneaky. Let me use the needle

1180
01:10:03,299 --> 01:10:04,561
I hate people who are taller than me

1181
01:10:43,672 --> 01:10:44,661
Invincible£¿

1182
01:10:45,674 --> 01:10:47,733
They need to breathe after all

1183
01:10:52,748 --> 01:10:54,807
Although the 18 Silver Evils are Invincible

1184
01:10:55,017 --> 01:10:57,542
they may not be
able to bear the sonic boom move

1185
01:10:58,320 --> 01:10:58,911
Start the drum!

1186
01:11:25,748 --> 01:11:26,476
Chanting Bing£¬ you..

1187
01:11:50,806 --> 01:11:52,034
Eat this apple

1188
01:11:52,708 --> 01:11:54,039
and you'll act like your dad

1189
01:11:54,677 --> 01:11:55,575
Listen to what I say

1190
01:12:00,816 --> 01:12:01,578
Chanting Bing

1191
01:12:02,685 --> 01:12:03,743
What are you doing£¿

1192
01:12:04,353 --> 01:12:05,342
Why are you here for me£¿

1193
01:12:06,388 --> 01:12:07,082
Why is it£¿

1194
01:12:08,691 --> 01:12:09,487
I am the real Chanting Bing

1195
01:12:10,826 --> 01:12:11,758
I got to beat you!

1196
01:12:28,577 --> 01:12:29,669
Abracadabra        Abracadabra

1197
01:12:29,745 --> 01:12:30,370
Most Exalted Lord Lao

1198
01:12:30,579 --> 01:12:31,068
Most Exalted Lord Lao

1199
01:12:31,146 --> 01:12:31,703
Give me your life!

1200
01:12:31,780 --> 01:12:32,712
Give me your life

1201
01:12:40,556 --> 01:12:41,887
Which one is real£¬ which one is fake£¿

1202
01:12:42,124 --> 01:12:43,455
Even I can't tell

1203
01:12:44,626 --> 01:12:45,593
Ok£¬ don't worry

1204
01:12:45,794 --> 01:12:46,556
I can

1205
01:12:47,396 --> 01:12:49,762
Whoever knows how to sing
the¡°The Fore stand The Field¡±

1206
01:12:49,898 --> 01:12:50,865
That one is real

1207
01:12:51,800 --> 01:12:52,892
Let's sing together

1208
01:12:54,002 --> 01:12:59,440
How I like to wander In the forest and plain

1209
01:12:59,575 --> 01:13:04,376
My dear friend£¬ what are you thinking£¿

1210
01:13:09,151 --> 01:13:10,641
Why don't you sing£¿

1211
01:13:11,053 --> 01:13:12,520
We don't know this song at all

1212
01:13:12,888 --> 01:13:14,116
Our theme song is ¡°Kiss Goodbye¡±

1213
01:13:23,031 --> 01:13:23,963
She knows how to become Invisible

1214
01:13:34,676 --> 01:13:35,472
You bitch!

1215
01:13:35,811 --> 01:13:36,835
Why do you mimicking me£¿

1216
01:13:37,079 --> 01:13:38,478
Outrageous

1217
01:13:38,614 --> 01:13:39,672
You are such a bitch!       Beat you

1218
01:13:45,454 --> 01:13:46,011
Two sisters..

1219
01:13:56,665 --> 01:13:57,563
I know which one is real

1220
01:13:57,733 --> 01:13:59,496
The real one had kissed me.
I remember the taste

1221
01:14:00,068 --> 01:14:01,000
Let me do it

1222
01:14:01,603 --> 01:14:02,592
Let me do it£¬ too

1223
01:14:03,539 --> 01:14:05,097
Write something

1224
01:14:33,735 --> 01:14:36,067
He was poisoned by me. He'll die once he smiles

1225
01:14:41,844 --> 01:14:44,779
Many sons.
Why did you block this palm move for me

1226
01:14:45,514 --> 01:14:46,503
Because..

1227
01:14:46,782 --> 01:14:48,807
Actually I like you a lot£¬ Madonna

1228
01:14:49,718 --> 01:14:50,480
Don't smile!

1229
01:14:50,819 --> 01:14:52,844
This palm move is so cruel.
You'll die if you smile

1230
01:14:52,988 --> 01:14:54,455
Men have to seek for happiness

1231
01:14:54,823 --> 01:14:56,222
I would rather die if I'm unhappy

1232
01:14:57,025 --> 01:14:58,126
Don't smile

1233
01:14:58,126 --> 01:14:59,787
I have something that have to tell you

1234
01:14:59,862 --> 01:15:01,625
Don't say too much

1235
01:15:02,030 --> 01:15:03,964
I have several hundreds of gold..

1236
01:15:04,766 --> 01:15:05,528
Fish for you

1237
01:15:06,835 --> 01:15:07,767
Then say it

1238
01:15:08,871 --> 01:15:10,202
Don't say it too loud for others to hear

1239
01:15:15,611 --> 01:15:17,670
But your voice is so soft that I can't hear

1240
01:15:17,813 --> 01:15:18,609
I've put it In..

1241
01:15:20,616 --> 01:15:21,810
Manysons

1242
01:15:22,150 --> 01:15:23,583
Don't die

1243
01:15:23,886 --> 01:15:24,750
The gold blocks£¬£¬

1244
01:15:24,887 --> 01:15:26,081
I don't want them anymore

1245
01:15:26,822 --> 01:15:28,551
No£¬ don't die..

1246
01:15:31,159 --> 01:15:32,524
Manysons..

1247
01:15:35,264 --> 01:15:36,663
Manysons..

1248
01:15:38,834 --> 01:15:44,704
Tiger Den

1249
01:15:57,986 --> 01:15:59,886
Today is our big day

1250
01:16:01,256 --> 01:16:02,553
Act happier

1251
01:16:05,193 --> 01:16:06,524
Smile

1252
01:16:10,732 --> 01:16:12,597
The speech I Taught you last night

1253
01:16:13,368 --> 01:16:15,131
say it to me

1254
01:16:30,152 --> 01:16:32,916
After...we are married..

1255
01:16:34,056 --> 01:16:36,251
We will go to Europe for honeymoon

1256
01:16:37,726 --> 01:16:39,216
Things in the troop..

1257
01:16:39,761 --> 01:16:41,888
will all be taken care by Team Leader Zhu

1258
01:16:43,098 --> 01:16:45,862
He will take full control over you

1259
01:16:47,803 --> 01:16:48,770
Nice

1260
01:16:51,273 --> 01:16:53,070
Miss Kurosawa. Everything is ready

1261
01:16:53,775 --> 01:16:54,901
Let's start then

1262
01:16:55,143 --> 01:16:55,871
Ok

1263
01:16:59,214 --> 01:17:02,184
The wedding of General Lin and Nie Wu Shuang

1264
01:17:02,184 --> 01:17:04,084
Will now begin

1265
01:17:29,678 --> 01:17:30,269
General Lin

1266
01:17:30,946 --> 01:17:32,880
Are you willing to marry
Nie Wu Shuang as your wife

1267
01:17:33,348 --> 01:17:36,112
For better for worse£¬ for richer for poorer£¬
In sickness and in health

1268
01:17:36,385 --> 01:17:38,376
to love and to cherish£¬
till death do you apart£¿

1269
01:17:39,221 --> 01:17:40,188
I..

1270
01:17:40,989 --> 01:17:41,648
I..

1271
01:17:43,725 --> 01:17:44,893
I am General Lin's daughter

1272
01:17:44,893 --> 01:17:45,723
Let me in

1273
01:17:50,666 --> 01:17:53,760
I...I..

1274
01:17:53,969 --> 01:17:54,765

01:17:55,237 --> 01:17:57,398
am...willing..

1276
01:18:02,844 --> 01:18:03,640
Forge ahead!

1277
01:18:09,685 --> 01:18:10,709
General Lin

1278
01:18:10,919 --> 01:18:13,046
Do you have anything to say to your juniors£¿

1279
01:18:15,323 --> 01:18:17,052
After we are married

1280
01:18:18,360 --> 01:18:20,760
We will go to Europe for honeymoon together

1281
01:18:21,430 --> 01:18:24,399
The things of the troop
will be handed over to..

1282
01:18:24,800 --> 01:18:25,892
to..

1283
01:18:30,872 --> 01:18:31,736
Come catch them!

1284
01:18:32,974 --> 01:18:34,703
I hate people pointing their guns on me

1285
01:18:35,877 --> 01:18:37,174
Freeze...all of you!

1286
01:18:37,679 --> 01:18:39,874
You bitch£¬ don't lure our Chinese men!

1287
01:19:07,509 --> 01:19:09,170
You've been doing it for so long yet
you could just push a little out of it

1288
01:19:09,344 --> 01:19:10,746
Take it slow

1289
01:19:10,746 --> 01:19:12,481
It will hurt...if you rush

1290
01:19:12,481 --> 01:19:13,072
Yes

1291
01:20:12,808 --> 01:20:15,276
Don't be so disgraceful. Go

1292
01:20:15,477 --> 01:20:17,274
You tom boy£¬ I have to kill you

1293
01:20:44,272 --> 01:20:44,897
Hi£¬ uncle

1294
01:20:45,273 --> 01:20:46,501
Dad£¬ are you ok£¿

1295
01:20:46,875 --> 01:20:47,569
I'm fine

1296
01:20:48,376 --> 01:20:49,110
He

1297
01:20:49,110 --> 01:20:49,906
They are my friends

1298
01:20:50,145 --> 01:20:51,169
They are here to save us

1299
01:20:55,517 --> 01:20:56,313
Not fooling with you

1300
01:21:01,556 --> 01:21:02,457
You are here at just about the right time

1301
01:21:02,457 --> 01:21:04,357
This one is too tough. You take care of it

1302
01:21:10,932 --> 01:21:11,296
Dad!

1303
01:21:42,430 --> 01:21:43,294
It's my fault

1304
01:21:43,431 --> 01:21:45,023
Would you let me go£¿

1305
01:21:57,112 --> 01:21:59,171
You idiot

1306
01:22:08,189 --> 01:22:09,622
If I can't fix you. I'll go and eat shit

1307
01:22:15,130 --> 01:22:15,892
Are you ok£¿

1308
01:22:16,097 --> 01:22:16,529
It's your turn..

1309
01:22:17,565 --> 01:22:17,929
Go

1310
01:22:41,523 --> 01:22:43,423
And you're still beating...
If you keep on beating

1311
01:22:50,465 --> 01:22:52,057
I'll hang you high

1312
01:22:56,271 --> 01:22:56,671
Great

1313
01:22:56,671 --> 01:22:57,228
Thanks

1314
01:24:13,448 --> 01:24:14,142
Young Man

1315
01:24:14,482 --> 01:24:16,575
I think your hatred towards him is stronger

1316
01:24:17,118 --> 01:24:17,982
So I'll hand this bastard over to you

1317
01:24:19,654 --> 01:24:21,485
Dad£¬ you are so awesome

1318
01:24:21,756 --> 01:24:23,246
Tony Luo£¬ it's him that had killed Howard Luo

1319
01:25:31,159 --> 01:25:32,217
Where do you still want to go£¿

1320
01:25:53,648 --> 01:25:54,080
That way

1321
01:26:04,692 --> 01:26:05,351
Be careful!

1322
01:26:19,641 --> 01:26:22,337
She has been here all the time
