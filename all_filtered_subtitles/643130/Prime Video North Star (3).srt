00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:11,320
Hudson,

2
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,400
Cheelik is wrong
about you. All wrong.

3
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:21,720
I helped raise you. I know.

4
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:27,080
Where are you going?

5
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:31,160
Unless I find out who tried to
kill me for the claim,

6
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,760
they will come back.

7
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:36,280
I'm going to Nome.

8
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,400
They will kill you.

9
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:42,280
If you fight for the cave,
and I know you will,

10
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:44,360
they will kill you.

11
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:01,800
Goodbye and good luck.

12
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,760
Take care of the dogs.

13
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:12,360
-CHEELIK: White man's trouble!
-Come.

14
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:40,200
Haina, take care of her.

15
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:02,240
NAKKI:
So you stole this woman?

16
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:18,880
Only to get away.

17
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:22,840
Let us stay until
the storm passes.

18
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:25,840
HUDSON: I'll take her back
when it's dark.

19
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:29,160
NAKKI: It is
too dangerous for us!

20
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:34,880
HUDSON: She's freezing.

21
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:37,800
If she stays out
she'll die.

22
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:01,720
Thank you.

23
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:05,960
The white man cannot
track you in this weather.

24
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:09,520
You may stay as long as
the storm continues.

25
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:14,400
Thank you, Nakki.

26
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:43,280
We're looking for
the white woman.

27
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:54,120
The half-breed brought her
here. We know that.

28
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:57,320
We haven't seen anyone...
