00:01:39,491 --> 00:01:45,163
有些人說聖經是最偉大的故事
Some people say the Bible
is the greatest story ever told.

3
00:01:49,167 --> 00:01:51,618
最好的故事是
The best story is:

4
00:01:51,628 --> 00:01:58,301
男孩遇見女孩  男孩失去女孩  男孩得到女孩
Boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy gets girl.

00:02:07,268 --> 00:02:11,718
你老二裡的每顆紅血球都在滲漏
when every corpuscle in your dick is percolating.

9
00:02:11,856 --> 00:02:16,066
當然 不是所有人都有相同的衝動
Of course, not everybody has the same impulse.

10
00:02:19,071 --> 00:02:20,521
你們在我房裡做什麼?
What are you doing in my room?

11
00:02:20,531 --> 00:02:23,733
瑞奇小子 你一整天都躲哪裡去了 啊?

00:02:23,743 --> 00:02:26,243
從我的床上滾下來
Get off my bunk.

13
00:02:26,329 --> 00:02:29,655
- 我想要你吸我的老二  - 滾開
- I want you to suck my dick. - Get lost.

14
00:02:29,665 --> 00:02:33,034

You're a fag. You suck dick. So what's the problem?

15
00:02:33,044 --> 00:02:36,287
我吸我想吸的老二  操你的

你不應該那樣和我說話
You shouldn't be talking that way to me.

18
00:02:49,018 --> 00:02:51,177
- 有問題嗎? 紳士們   - 沒有
- Is there a problem, gentlemen? - No.

19
00:02:51,187 --> 00:02:56,347

你最好小心點 瑞奇
You better watch it, Richie.

21
00:03:04,533 --> 00:03:09,236
發生在亞歷山大 沃格身上的事 也會發生在你身上
What happened to Alexander Vogel

22
00:03:09,246 --> 00:03:13,240
你明天會倒吊著醒來
You're gonna wake up tomorrow hanging by your ankles,

23
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:16,003
- 死透了  - 你殺了沃格?

我把他推開
I shoved him away.

41
00:04:44,299 --> 00:04:47,167
你會被控訴謀殺
You're gonna be charged with murder.

42
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:48,500
- 幹  - 警官

43
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,900
靠 等等!
Shit, shit. Wait!

44
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:56,940
如果我給你一點情報
If I give you some information,

45
00:04:58,396 --> 00:05:00,054
我能得到什麼作為交換?
what kind of deal can I get in return?

46
00:05:00,064 --> 00:05:03,614
那要看你的情報是什麼
Well, that depends on your information.

47
00:05:03,985 --> 00:05:07,235
是關於謀殺 一件真正的謀殺案
It's about a murder. A real murder.

48
00:05:08,906 --> 00:05:12,666
- 在奧茲裡發生的?  - 亞歷山大 沃格
- A murder here in Oz? - Alexander Vogel.

49
00:05:12,702 --> 00:05:14,694
- 沃格?  - 對
- Vogel?  - Yeah.

50
00:05:14,704 --> 00:05:17,530
如果我告訴你是誰殺了沃格
If I tell you who killed Vogel,

51
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:20,040
我可以得到輕一點的罪行嗎?
can I get a lesser charge?

52
00:05:20,877 --> 00:05:24,871
那要看你的情報可不可靠
Well, that depends on if your information sticks.

53
00:05:24,881 --> 00:05:26,873
我們又見面了 席林格
Here we are again, Schillinger.

54
00:05:26,883 --> 00:05:30,251
只是這次 我有你殺了沃格的證據
Only this time, I got proof that you killed Vogel.

55
00:05:30,261 --> 00:05:34,390
- 證據?  - 你的朋友麥克自白了
- Proof? - Your friend Mack confessed.

56
00:05:34,557 --> 00:05:36,549
放屁
Horseshit.

57
00:05:36,559 --> 00:05:40,928
他和另一個犯人說 是你和他一起做的
He told another prisoner
that you and he did the deed together.

58
00:05:40,938 --> 00:05:43,816
喔 監獄裡的自白?
Oh, a jailhouse confession?

59
00:05:43,983 --> 00:05:47,194
拜託 麥克不會承認的
Please. Mack will deny it.

60
00:05:47,361 --> 00:05:52,815
而且我們有兩個人 我們兩個的說法對上那個多嘴的傢伙
And it's the two of us, our word
against whoever the jabber is.

61
00:05:52,825 --> 00:05:57,403
麥克正在另一間房間吐露他的心聲呢
Mack's in the other room right now spilling his guts out.

62
00:05:57,413 --> 00:05:59,913
我說了 放屁
Like I said, horseshit.

63
00:06:00,499 --> 00:06:02,999
就算他是
And even if he was,

64
00:06:03,669 --> 00:06:08,239
你覺得我會和你承認是我做的嗎?
do you think I would admit to you that I did it?

65
00:06:08,257 --> 00:06:13,752
你是他媽作了什麼瘋狂的夢 才覺得我會讓你感到滿意?
In your wildest fucking dreams,
would I ever give you that satisfaction?

66
00:06:13,762 --> 00:06:16,088
不
No.

67
00:06:16,098 --> 00:06:18,598
帶他出去
Take him out.

68
00:06:27,568 --> 00:06:30,602
- 怎麼了  - 好好聽清楚了
- Yeah? - Listen up and listen good.

69
00:06:30,612 --> 00:06:32,771
我的一些朋友非常的生氣
Some friends of mine are very upset

70
00:06:32,781 --> 00:06:35,983
你試著把一件謀殺案冠在他們身上
that you tried to pin a certain murder on them.

71
00:06:35,993 --> 00:06:39,611
- 因為那件事 你死定了  - 喔 天啊
- For that, you're a dead man. - Oh, Christ.

72
00:06:39,621 --> 00:06:42,781
但是 他們願意給你另一個選擇
However, they're offering you an alternative.

73
00:06:42,791 --> 00:06:45,325
既然你已經因為殺了一個人待在這裡了
Since you're already in here for one killing,

74
00:06:45,335 --> 00:06:49,204
他們建議你也扛下亞歷山大 沃格的謀殺案
they suggest you also confess
to Alexander Vogel's murder.

75
00:06:49,214 --> 00:06:50,789
上法院一搏
Take your chances with the court.

76
00:06:50,799 --> 00:06:56,211
最好 你被判終生監禁  最壞 你被判死刑
At best, you get life. At worst, you get the death penalty.

77
00:06:56,221 --> 00:07:00,382
如果你被判終生 我的朋友會讓你活下來
If you get life, my friends will let you live.

78
00:07:00,392 --> 00:07:03,812
如果不是 那樣 你本來也該死了
If not, you're a dead man anyway.

79
00:07:09,317 --> 00:07:11,817
所以 選吧
So choose.

80
00:07:18,994 --> 00:07:21,504
告訴葛林我想見他
Tell Glynn I wanna see him.

81
00:07:22,163 --> 00:07:24,753
我要坦承一件事情
I have a confession to make.

82
00:07:25,208 --> 00:07:27,708
乖孩子
Good boy.

83
00:07:59,659 --> 00:08:02,159
奧古斯塔斯
Augustus.

84
00:08:06,499 --> 00:08:11,452
- 審訊的時候到了  - 我有點頭暈了 老兄
- It's almost time for the hearing.
- I got lost in my head, man.

85
00:08:11,462 --> 00:08:13,871
你在想什麼?
What were you thinking?

86
00:08:13,881 --> 00:08:16,381
我在想
I was thinking that

87
00:08:16,426 --> 00:08:18,926
如果一切順利的話
if all goes well,

88
00:08:19,554 --> 00:08:23,044
我可能真的有機會從奧茲裡出去
I might actually be rolling out of Oz.

89
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:29,897
太陽下山的時候 我就能在家裡陪伴我老婆
That by sundown, I could be home with my wife.

90
00:08:30,064 --> 00:08:32,557
我會在我的房裡 喝著冰啤酒
I could be in my house drinking a cold beer,

91
00:08:32,567 --> 00:08:35,560
看揚基和金鶯的比賽 你懂我說的嗎?
watching the Yankees and the Orioles.
You know what I'm saying?

92
00:08:35,570 --> 00:08:38,070
太陽下山的時候
You know, by sundown...

93
00:08:39,073 --> 00:08:41,607
我可能真的就自由了 老兄
...l could actually be free, man.

94
00:08:41,617 --> 00:08:44,117
嘿
Hey.

95
00:08:48,124 --> 00:08:50,624
嘿
Hey.

96
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:56,924
案件編號966133的正式審訊
Formal hearing of case number 966133,

97
00:08:57,091 --> 00:08:59,591
希爾 對上州政府
Hill v. the State.

98
00:09:04,056 --> 00:09:06,556
薩伊德先生
Mr. Said.

99
00:09:10,563 --> 00:09:13,063
法官大人
Your Honour.

100
00:09:13,107 --> 00:09:17,768
理查 奇伯勒在州立刑事法庭任職法官時
It is already a matter of public record that Richard Kibler,

101
00:09:17,778 --> 00:09:21,772
收賄並判處三個殺人犯較輕的刑罰
while serving as a judge on the state criminal court,

102
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:28,020
已是公眾認定的事實
took money in exchange for giving out more
lenient sentences to three convicted murderers.

103
00:09:28,664 --> 00:09:33,127
薩伊德先生聲稱他的客戶遭到不平待遇
Mr. Said claims bias against his client

104
00:09:33,293 --> 00:09:37,204
因為他沒有給予賄金 也不知道有那種可能性
because he neither gave bribes nor knew of that possibility.

105
00:09:37,214 --> 00:09:40,676
但那並不是不公平待遇
But that in itself is not bias.

106
00:09:40,843 --> 00:09:44,211
辯護方必須呈現出實際的證據
The defendant has got to show the actuality,

107
00:09:44,221 --> 00:09:46,721
而不是光憑表象
not the appearance of bias.

108
00:09:46,849 --> 00:09:49,299
在奇伯勒收賄的同一段時間
Well, at the same time that Kibler was accepting bribes,

109
00:09:49,309 --> 00:09:51,510
我的客戶來到他面前
my client came before him.

110
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:53,470
我的客戶被判有罪
Now, my client was found guilty

111
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:57,099
並被奇伯勒判刑終生監禁
and sentenced by Kibler to life imprisonment

112
00:09:57,109 --> 00:10:00,143
20年後才可得到假釋
with the possibility of parole in 20 years.

113
00:10:00,153 --> 00:10:03,480
法官大人 奧古斯塔斯 希爾冷血地謀殺了一名警官
Your Honour, Augustus Hill
murdered a police officer in cold blood.

114
00:10:03,490 --> 00:10:04,773
反對
Objection.

115
00:10:04,783 --> 00:10:07,484
他犯下的罪對他得到的刑期有著直接的關聯
The nature of his crime has direct bearing on his sentence.

116
00:10:07,494 --> 00:10:09,994
反對無效
Overruled.

117
00:10:10,330 --> 00:10:13,333
薩伊德先生要求法庭
Mr. Said has asked the court

118
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:16,576
因為奇伯勒法官被判刑
for an automatic reversal of Hill's conviction

119
00:10:16,586 --> 00:10:20,330
來推翻希爾之前的判刑
due to the circumstance of Judge Kibler's conviction.

120
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:22,415
因為那種腐敗貪污的情況
Due to the circumstances of corruption,

121
00:10:22,425 --> 00:10:26,545
由於一個不公正的法官
that my client was denied
his fundamental right to a fair trial,

122
00:10:26,555 --> 00:10:28,755
我的客戶被拒絕了他得到公正審判的基本權利
presided over by an impartial judge.

123
00:10:28,765 --> 00:10:31,216
因為這樣 奧古斯塔斯 希爾
And that therefore, Augustus Hill

124
00:10:31,226 --> 00:10:34,594
有理由得到推翻前次定罪的判決
is entitled to an automatic reversal of his conviction.

125
00:10:34,604 --> 00:10:39,891
但並沒有法庭作出這種判決的先例
But there is no precedent
for the court to make such a ruling.

126
00:10:39,901 --> 00:10:44,688
事實上 這樣做的話 是創造一條法規
In fact, to do so would, in effect, create a rule of law

127
00:10:44,698 --> 00:10:48,702
那已經超過了法庭的權限
that is beyond the court's jurisdiction.

128
00:10:48,868 --> 00:10:51,938
薩伊德先生 請找來你的第一個證人
Mr. Said, call your first witness.

129
00:10:52,288 --> 00:10:54,739
奧古斯塔斯 希爾
Augustus Hill.

130
00:10:54,749 --> 00:10:56,991
你願意向神發誓 一切據實以報
Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth,

131
00:10:57,001 --> 00:10:59,702
實話實說 絕無欺瞞?
and nothing but the truth, so help you God?

132
00:10:59,712 --> 00:11:02,212
我願意
I do.

133
00:11:07,679 --> 00:11:09,796
怎麼樣了?
How's it going?

134
00:11:09,806 --> 00:11:12,306
我也說不清楚
I can't tell yet.

135
00:11:12,517 --> 00:11:15,885
這傢伙 佛圖納托 他很強硬 很會說
This guy, Fortunato, he's tough, he's good.

136
00:11:15,895 --> 00:11:19,415
- 薩伊德呢?  - 他被駁回了很多次
- And Said? - He gets overruled a lot.

137
00:11:20,483 --> 00:11:21,974
我不知道 很奇怪啊 老兄
I don't know. It's funny, man.

138
00:11:21,984 --> 00:11:24,227
我比第一次審判的時候還要緊張
I'm more nervous now than I was at my first trial.

139
00:11:24,237 --> 00:11:25,937
你有理由啊
Makes sense.

140
00:11:25,947 --> 00:11:28,147
你有可能再也不會見到監獄內部
Then you'd never seen the inside of a prison.

141
00:11:28,157 --> 00:11:30,900
被監禁也就變成個念頭罷了
Incarceration was merely a concept.

142
00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:32,110
現在你知道事實了
Now you know the reality.

143
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:34,445
你知道判決於你不利的後果
You know the price if the verdict goes against you.

144
00:11:34,455 --> 00:11:36,572
奧古斯塔斯
Augustus,

145
00:11:36,582 --> 00:11:38,908
我們需要切確的證據
we need a smoking gun.

146
00:11:38,918 --> 00:11:42,745
我們需要找到一個沒有行賄
We need to find a convicted felon
who was asked to give a bribe, didn't,

147
00:11:42,755 --> 00:11:44,956
最後得到不公平刑期的犯人
and then was sentenced unfairly.

148
00:11:44,966 --> 00:11:50,044
- 你怎麼知道有那種人存在? - 就算有 你又要怎麼找到他?
- How do you know that one exists?
- And if he does, how do you find him?

149
00:11:50,054 --> 00:11:51,754
這是在草堆裡找一根針嘛
It's a needle in a haystack.

150
00:11:51,764 --> 00:11:54,256
最快找到那根針的方法
Quickest way to find the needle,

151
00:11:54,266 --> 00:11:56,766
就是把草堆給燒掉
burn the haystack.

152
00:12:00,064 --> 00:12:02,734
那他媽是什麼意思?
What the fuck does that mean?

153
00:12:26,966 --> 00:12:29,466
你看 我的兄弟
Here you go, my brother.

154
00:12:29,969 --> 00:12:34,672
一份被奇伯勒審判的殺人犯名單
A list of names of all the murderers convicted by Kibler.

155
00:12:34,682 --> 00:12:37,800
如果他們其中一個人願意作證他們沒有付錢
Now, if one of them testifies
that they didn't offer a bribe

156
00:12:37,810 --> 00:12:41,387
我們證明他們被判得不公正
and we show that they were sentenced unfairly,

157
00:12:41,397 --> 00:12:43,897
我們就能證實偏見確實存在
we prove bias.

158
00:12:46,193 --> 00:12:48,435
我們沒有時間去聯絡所有的人 老兄
We ain't got time to contact all these people, man.

159
00:12:48,445 --> 00:12:51,245
我們正在開庭中啊
We in the middle of the trial.

160
00:12:51,657 --> 00:12:55,887
我們一個星期前就該想到了
We should've thought of this a week ago, man.

161
00:12:56,995 --> 00:13:00,322
我們已經說過了 不會有使用電話的特權
We've already told you,
no special phone privileges.

162
00:13:00,332 --> 00:13:02,616
讓我用傳真來聯絡清單上的人
Let me use the fax to contact the men on the list.

163
00:13:02,626 --> 00:13:03,825
不行
No.

164
00:13:03,835 --> 00:13:07,454
你以為我會幫你把這間監獄變成人民法院?
You think I'm gonna help you turn
this prison into The People's Court?

165
00:13:07,464 --> 00:13:11,083
你贏了 你會替所有的犯人重新翻案
You win this one, you'll be reopening
the case of every prisoner in here.

166
00:13:11,093 --> 00:13:14,378
那錯了嗎? 為正義抗爭?
And is that wrong? To strive for justice?

167
00:13:14,388 --> 00:13:16,797
- 正義?  - 對
- Justice? - Yeah.

168
00:13:16,807 --> 00:13:20,727
貪汙? 不管是不是那個法官 希爾殺了一個警察
Crooked? judge or not, Hill shot a cop.

169
00:13:23,313 --> 00:13:25,813
警官
Officer.

170
00:13:26,149 --> 00:13:28,975
不管我有沒有贏這件案子 獄長
Whether I win or lose this case, warden,

171
00:13:28,985 --> 00:13:34,465
我永遠不會停止幫助我的兄弟們得到自由
I am never gonna stop
helping my brothers fight for freedom.

172
00:13:45,251 --> 00:13:48,380
他說不行 又一次
He said no. Again.

173
00:13:49,047 --> 00:13:50,455
所以我會打電話給我的出版商
So I'm gonna call my publisher,

174
00:13:50,465 --> 00:13:53,166
讓他聯絡那些人的律師
get him to contact the lawyers of all the men convicted.

175
00:13:53,176 --> 00:13:56,878
那還是需要我們沒有的東西  時間
Still gonna take the one thing we ain't got: time.

176
00:13:56,888 --> 00:13:59,390
那我們就製造時間
Then we create time.

177
00:14:01,059 --> 00:14:03,593
如果判決對我們不利 我會上訴
If the decision goes against us, I'll appeal.

178
00:14:03,603 --> 00:14:05,011
基於什麼理由?
On what grounds?

179
00:14:05,021 --> 00:14:09,766
萊瑪法官駁回我所有的反對是因為種族歧視
The only reason Judge Lema is
overruling all my objections is racism.

180
00:14:09,776 --> 00:14:13,061
就不是因為你的反對都很白癡 是吧?
It couldn't be because most
of your objections are stupid, right?

181
00:14:13,071 --> 00:14:14,938
不 也不會是因為 你知道嘛
No. It couldn't be because maybe, you know,

182
00:14:14,948 --> 00:14:17,941
你沒有你自己想像中那麼好
you're not as good a lawyer as you think you are.

183
00:14:17,951 --> 00:14:19,901
你想換掉我嗎?
You wanna replace me?

184
00:14:19,911 --> 00:14:22,028
你想要讓比雀處理我們的訴訟?
You wanna get Beecher to take up our cause?

185
00:14:22,038 --> 00:14:23,738
我們的訴訟?
Our cause?

186
00:14:23,748 --> 00:14:27,075
這不是我們的訴訟 這他媽是我的人生
This is not our cause, this is my fucking life.

187
00:14:27,085 --> 00:14:28,326
我不是你 老兄
I am not you, man.

188
00:14:28,336 --> 00:14:30,620
我不想當個烈士 或是該死的聖人
I don't wanna be a martyr or a fucking saint.

189
00:14:30,630 --> 00:14:32,705
我只想要離開這裡 得到自由
All I wanna do is get out of here and be free.

190
00:14:32,715 --> 00:14:37,765
你要是辦不到 他媽就離我遠一點
Either you can do that or you leave me the fuck alone.

191
00:14:38,262 --> 00:14:40,762
操他媽的!
Goddamn it!

192
00:14:44,519 --> 00:14:48,763
在我下判決前有人有任何話要說嗎?
Does anyone else have anything to say before I give my ruling?

193
00:14:48,773 --> 00:14:50,973
是的 法官大人 我有話要說
Yes, Your Honour, I do.

194
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:54,860
簡潔一點 薩伊德先生 我開車回去很遠 尖峰時段
Make it snappy, Mr. Said.
I've got a long ride home. Rush hour.

195
00:14:57,406 --> 00:14:59,982
因為我和我的客戶是犯人
Because my client and I are prisoners

196
00:14:59,992 --> 00:15:03,944
我們的時間和資源都受到了一定的限制
and certain restrictions are placed
upon our time and our resources,

197
00:15:03,954 --> 00:15:08,032
我們沒有機會去取得更進一步的證據
we do not have the opportunity to obtain further evidence.

198
00:15:08,042 --> 00:15:12,042
- 收到了  - 還有一件事 法官大人
- Duly noted. - One more thing, Your Honour.

199
00:15:12,296 --> 00:15:13,537
我們或許永遠不會知道
We'll probably never know

200
00:15:13,547 --> 00:15:17,707
奇伯勒法官是怎麼看待奧古斯塔斯 希爾
what Judge Kibler thought about Augustus Hill.

201
00:15:18,803 --> 00:15:23,047
但我們很清楚他如何看待正義
But we have a pretty clear picture
about what he thinks about justice.

202
00:15:23,057 --> 00:15:25,557
謝謝你
Thank you.

203
00:15:29,313 --> 00:15:30,721
州政府的立場是
To the State's argument

204
00:15:30,731 --> 00:15:35,809
因為沒有推翻定罪的前例
that because there is no precedent
for reversing the conviction,

205
00:15:35,819 --> 00:15:40,606
作出這樣的裁決將會超越這個法庭的權限
that this court would be ruling
beyond its jurisdiction,

206
00:15:40,616 --> 00:15:43,116
我來說的話 鬼扯
I say, "Bunk."

207
00:15:43,327 --> 00:15:46,580
前例之所以變成前例
How do precedents become precedents

208
00:15:46,747 --> 00:15:50,626
不就是法官判決的嗎?
unless some judge sets one?

209
00:15:50,793 --> 00:15:55,380
然而  以州政府的觀點來說
However, the State's view

210
00:15:55,547 --> 00:15:59,708
辯護方必須拿出比偏見表象更多的證據
that the defendant must show more
than the appearance of bias

211
00:15:59,718 --> 00:16:01,793
才能證實
rings true.

212
00:16:01,803 --> 00:16:08,101
我已經仔細看過希爾先生在庭審上的紀錄
I have reviewed the transcript of Mr. Hill's trial thoroughly.

213
00:16:08,268 --> 00:16:14,024
奇伯勒法官在言行上
At no point did Judge Kibler, in word or deed,

214
00:16:14,191 --> 00:16:19,821
並沒有超出司法程序規範的限制
act beyond the limits
of the rules of judicial procedure.

215
00:16:20,030 --> 00:16:25,192
根據罪行嚴重程度所判下的刑期
And the sentencing, given the severity of the convictions,

216
00:16:25,202 --> 00:16:29,331
並未顯示過度嚴厲
does not appear to be unduly cruel...

217
00:16:30,707 --> 00:16:32,491
或是不尋常的跡象
...or unusual.

218
00:16:32,501 --> 00:16:36,203
因此  我的裁決站在州政府這一邊
Therefore, I rule in favour of the State

219
00:16:36,213 --> 00:16:42,219
否決推翻奧古斯塔斯 希爾定罪的請願
and deny Augustus Hill's motion for a reversal of his conviction.

220
00:16:44,429 --> 00:16:47,547
不要失去信心 兄弟  這只是剛開始而已
Do not lose faith, my brother. This is just the beginning.

221
00:16:47,557 --> 00:16:50,185
不 結束了
No. It's over.

222
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,761
- 奧古斯塔斯...   - 不
- Augustus...  - No.

223
00:16:52,771 --> 00:16:54,804
我不能再忍受這些鳥事了
I can't handle this shit any more.

224
00:16:54,814 --> 00:16:57,057
我告訴過你了 這需要時間
I told you before, these things take time.

225
00:16:57,067 --> 00:16:59,225
- 法律是...  - 不是法律  老兄
- The law is very...  - it's not the law, man.

226
00:16:59,235 --> 00:17:04,225
我不是不能忍受法律程序  而是希望
It's not the law that I can't handle. It's the hope.

227
00:17:04,866 --> 00:17:09,078
希望正在把我壓垮啊 老兄
The hope is crushing me, man.

228
00:17:11,581 --> 00:17:15,168
希望?  我們只有希望啊
Hope? Hope is all we have.

229
00:17:15,752 --> 00:17:20,840
不  我只有奧茲
No. All I have is Oz.

230
00:17:28,806 --> 00:17:30,798
好了  誰想下一個來?
All right, who wants to go next?

231
00:17:30,808 --> 00:17:33,551
- 嘿  我能讀一首詩嗎?  - 好啊
- Hey, can I read a poem?  - Yeah.

232
00:17:33,561 --> 00:17:35,762
我寫的
Something I wrote.

233
00:17:35,772 --> 00:17:37,764
我牢房的裡側
The inside of my cell

234
00:17:37,774 --> 00:17:42,769
在我尋找清靜之時  看我被它的平靜所引誘
See me be seduced by its serenity
In my search for privacy

235
00:17:42,779 --> 00:17:44,937
在緊閉的牢籠之後
Behind the locked cages

236
00:17:44,947 --> 00:17:48,149
立法者們升起 但平靜死去
The makers of the rules rise
But peace dies

237
00:17:48,159 --> 00:17:51,486
詛咒是親吻  愛意是不敬
Curses is kisses
And adoration is disses

238
00:17:51,496 --> 00:17:55,364
在這美麗地醜惡的地方  我看到了我的永遠
In this beautifully disgusting place
Where I see my forever

239
00:17:55,374 --> 00:17:57,874
稱它作翡翠城...
Call it Emerald City Ex...

240
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:00,745
- 死玻璃 你講完你的玻璃話了嗎?  - 你叫誰玻璃?
- Faggot, you done with your faggotry?
- Who you calling a faggot?

241
00:18:00,755 --> 00:18:02,872
我他媽就叫你玻璃  死玻璃
I'm calling you a fucking faggot, you faggot.

242
00:18:02,882 --> 00:18:05,582
- 嘿 大夥  - 嘿 嘿 嘿
- Hey, guys.  - Hey, hey, hey.

243
00:18:06,802 --> 00:18:08,794
你已經在這裡惹事過一次了
Now, you already started one fight in here.

244
00:18:08,804 --> 00:18:12,794
下一次就是在普通牢房裡  回去
Next one's gonna be in gen pop. Step back.

245
00:18:13,684 --> 00:18:16,184
繼續走 滾出去
Go on, get out of here.

246
00:18:19,815 --> 00:18:22,224
汪格勒需要調整態度 你懂嗎?
Wangler needs attitude realignment, you know?

247
00:18:22,234 --> 00:18:25,102
因為我逼他來上課 所以他很火大
Well, he's pissed off because
I'm forcing him to come to class.

248
00:18:25,112 --> 00:18:27,480
我不懂  他原本學習的進度很好
I don't get it. He was doing well learning how to read.

249
00:18:27,490 --> 00:18:30,065
- 現在他完全不想學了  - 阿德比希在找他麻煩
- Now he's shut off completely.
- Adebisi's giving him heat.

250
00:18:30,075 --> 00:18:31,984
我在試著給他一些空間
So I'm trying to give him room to move.

251
00:18:31,994 --> 00:18:33,861
詩人作得怎麼樣了?
What about Poet?

252
00:18:33,871 --> 00:18:36,571
- 那小子很有天分  - 聽著
- Kid's got talent.  - Listen.

253
00:18:37,499 --> 00:18:38,991
這裡有個錄音機
Here's a tape recorder.

254
00:18:39,001 --> 00:18:42,328
你錄下五、六首他的詩  再拿給我
You record five or six of his poems, give this back to me.

255
00:18:42,338 --> 00:18:44,838
- 為什麼?  - 我有個計劃
- Why?  - I got a plan.

256
00:18:57,519 --> 00:19:00,019
謝謝你
Thank you.

257
00:19:01,023 --> 00:19:04,993
- 坐下吧  - 你想要什麼 米克麥諾斯?
- Have a seat.  - What do you want, McManus?

258
00:19:07,696 --> 00:19:12,524
我讀完你那本有關暴動的書了  - 我猜你想要我的簽名
- I finished your book on the riot.
- I suppose you want my autograph.

259
00:19:12,534 --> 00:19:15,193
我想和你談談詩人的事
I wanna talk to you about Poet.

260
00:19:15,203 --> 00:19:17,703
這裡有一些他的作品
There's some of his work.

261
00:19:22,753 --> 00:19:28,153
我想要你聯絡你的出版商  給他看看這些詩
I want you to contact your publisher,
show him those poems.

63%的人活了十年
and 63 percent are alive after ten years.

390
00:27:36,158 --> 00:27:39,652
我假釋是11年後  未來很有可能
I'm up for parole in 11 years. The way things go for me,

391
00:27:39,662 --> 00:27:42,738
我自由以後  腫瘤又長回來了
I'll get released and...Boom! The tumour's back.

392
00:27:42,748 --> 00:27:45,366
你很年輕  其他方面都很健康
You're young. You're otherwise healthy.

393
00:27:45,376 --> 00:27:47,876
你沒問題的
You'll be okay.

394
00:28:21,161 --> 00:28:24,154
萊恩 歐萊利今天要回來翡翠城
Ryan O'Reily's coming back to Emerald City today.

395
00:28:24,164 --> 00:28:25,489
喔 是喔
Oh, yeah?

396
00:28:25,499 --> 00:28:27,824
在醫院他媽待了很長一段時間啊
Been in the hospital a long fucking time.

397
00:28:27,834 --> 00:28:29,576
絕對是出什麼事了
Must be something really wrong with him.

398
00:28:29,586 --> 00:28:31,954
我聽說歐萊利在班曲利紀念醫院作了手術
I hear O'Reily had surgery at Benchley Memorial

399
00:28:31,964 --> 00:28:34,039
現在他要開始作化療
and now he's going through chemotherapy.

400
00:28:34,049 --> 00:28:38,043
化療 那很糟啊 老兄  那東西會有很壞的副作用
Chemo, that's bad, man. That shit does bad shit to you.

401
00:28:38,053 --> 00:28:40,563
也可以救你的命啊
It can also save your life.

402
00:29:10,210 --> 00:29:12,035
你他媽看什麼看?
What the fuck you looking at?

403
00:29:12,045 --> 00:29:16,095
- 沒有 萊恩  - 他媽給我滾出去
- Nothing, Ryan.  - Get the fuck out of here.

404
00:29:31,523 --> 00:29:34,567
嘿 我想回來廚房
Hey, I want back in the kitchen.

405
00:29:34,984 --> 00:29:37,352
- 別想  - 施貝塔 我沒在跟你開玩笑
- Forget about it.  - Schibetta, I'm not fucking around.

406
00:29:37,362 --> 00:29:40,722
他說了你別想  小病號
He says forget about it, cancer boy.

407
00:29:42,492 --> 00:29:45,109
- 臭玻璃  - 歐萊利 你想變得和我們一樣是不是?
- Faggot.  - O'Reily, you trying to look like us?

408
00:29:45,119 --> 00:29:46,945
對 我想變醜
Yeah, I'm trying to be ugly.

409
00:29:46,955 --> 00:29:50,156
大家都在猜你是發生了什麼事
People have been wondering
what exactly is wrong with you.

410
00:29:50,166 --> 00:29:52,533
斯蓋茲說是睪丸癌
Scatz here says it's cancer of the balls,

411
00:29:52,543 --> 00:29:55,213
醫生把你的蛋蛋給切掉了
that the doctor cut them off.

412
00:29:55,338 --> 00:29:57,497
但我說那不可能
But I say that can't be it.

413
00:29:57,507 --> 00:30:01,767
因為你根本就沒有蛋蛋可以切啊
Because you never had any balls to begin with.

414
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:24,857
你知道規矩 歐萊利  你打架就得進洞裡
You know the rules, O'Reily.
You get in a fight, you go to the hole.

415
00:30:24,867 --> 00:30:27,693
讓我去啊 他媽的我又不是沒待過
So send me to the fucking hole. I've been there before.

416
00:30:27,703 --> 00:30:29,362
我不怕
I ain't afraid.

417
00:30:29,372 --> 00:30:33,949
對 可是 依你的狀況  你可能會感冒
Yeah, well, in your condition, you know, you're likely to get a cold,

418
00:30:33,959 --> 00:30:37,078
然後你死掉  我就得交一大堆的報告
then you die, and then I got a shitload of paperwork to do.

419
00:30:37,088 --> 00:30:38,412
真好笑
That's funny.

420
00:30:38,422 --> 00:30:41,957
聽著 萊恩 你還有六個星期的化療
Look, Ryan, you've got six weeks of chemo left.

421
00:30:41,967 --> 00:30:47,177
好嗎? 所以我們決定你可以待在病房直到結束
Okay? So we decided you can stay in the ward until then.

422
00:30:48,474 --> 00:30:50,974
帶他去醫院
Take him to the hospital.

423
00:31:22,591 --> 00:31:24,082
嘿
Hey.

424
00:31:24,092 --> 00:31:26,460
嘿
Hey.

425
00:31:26,470 --> 00:31:28,420
感覺怎麼樣?
How are you feeling?

426
00:31:28,430 --> 00:31:30,172
身體上沒問題
Physically, fine.

427
00:31:30,182 --> 00:31:33,884
但我得跟妳說 自從我搭上去醫院的箱車後
But I gotta tell you, ever since riding
in the van on the way to surgery,

428
00:31:33,894 --> 00:31:39,473
妳知道  在外頭是我唯一能想著的事情
you know, being on the outside.
Since then, that's all I can think about.

429
00:31:39,483 --> 00:31:41,266
妳知道  自由的感覺
You know, being free.

430
00:31:41,276 --> 00:31:46,271
做我想念的事情  那些在這裡不能做的事情
Doing the things that I miss. Things that I can't do in here.

431
00:31:46,281 --> 00:31:49,401
像什麼?  你最想念什麼?
Like what? What do you miss most?

432
00:31:50,780 --> 00:31:52,380
接吻
Kissing.

433
00:31:53,121 --> 00:31:56,656
- 你想念你的老婆  - 我想念熱情
- You miss your wife.  - I miss affection.

434
00:31:56,666 --> 00:31:59,166
任何一種熱情
Any kind of affection.

435
00:32:00,545 --> 00:32:04,789
就像在動手術之前  妳牽了我的手
Like just before the operation when you took my hand,

436
00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:07,299
你的肌膚的溫度
the heat of your skin...

437
00:32:08,303 --> 00:32:11,903
在我身上點了一把火
...it sent a brushfire through my body.

438
00:32:11,973 --> 00:32:13,298
好笑吧  啊?
Funny, huh?

439
00:32:13,308 --> 00:32:19,022
就這麼簡單的事  指尖的碰觸
A simple thing like that. Fingers touching fingers.

440
00:32:22,859 --> 00:32:25,359
我想要碰妳
I wanna touch you.

441
00:32:26,863 --> 00:32:29,363
我想要吻妳
I wanna kiss you.

442
00:32:33,203 --> 00:32:35,703
別那樣做
Well, don't.

443
00:32:54,265 --> 00:32:57,185
- 嘿 葛羅莉亞  - 嘿
- Hello, Gloria.  - Hey.

444
00:32:59,062 --> 00:33:00,595
怎麼啦?
What's wrong?

445
00:33:00,605 --> 00:33:02,764
為什麼妳會覺得我怎麼了?
What makes you think something's wrong?

446
00:33:02,774 --> 00:33:05,975
我是心理學家和修女
Well, I'm a psychologist and a nun.

447
00:33:05,985 --> 00:33:10,515
通常 在這兩者之間 總有什麼是有問題的
Usually, between the two, there's something wrong.

448
00:33:10,531 --> 00:33:11,773
妳知道 在醫學院的時候
You know, in med school,

449
00:33:11,783 --> 00:33:15,359
他們不斷告訴我們
the one thing they keep pounding into our heads:

450
00:33:15,369 --> 00:33:17,955
醫生不表現出情緒
Doctors don't show emotion.

451
00:33:18,122 --> 00:33:20,622
醫生保持距離
Doctors keep their distance.

452
00:33:21,334 --> 00:33:23,201
醫生不和病人牽扯過多
Doctors don't get involved with a patient.

453
00:33:23,211 --> 00:33:25,711
喔 天啊
Oh, my.

454
00:33:27,548 --> 00:33:30,048
我能問是誰嗎?
May I ask which one?

455
00:33:34,597 --> 00:33:37,097
萊恩 歐萊利
Ryan O'Reily.

456
00:33:37,183 --> 00:33:40,718
為什麼?  為什麼妳特別受到他的吸引?
Why him? Why are you attracted to him specifically?

457
00:33:40,728 --> 00:33:43,228
不知道
I don't know.

458
00:33:43,689 --> 00:33:46,189
他很帥
He's handsome.

459
00:33:46,484 --> 00:33:49,018
他有那種奇怪的愛爾蘭人魅力
He's got the bullshit lrish charm.

460
00:33:49,028 --> 00:33:51,528
還有乳癌
And breast cancer.

461
00:33:58,579 --> 00:34:01,079
我媽也有乳癌
My mom had breast cancer.

462
00:34:01,624 --> 00:34:04,710
我的阿姨  我的姊姊
My aunt, my sister.

463
00:34:04,877 --> 00:34:07,677
我可能也會有吧
I'm probably gonna get it too.

464
00:34:08,922 --> 00:34:11,624
我知道他會經歷什麼
I know what he's going through.

465
00:34:11,634 --> 00:34:14,793
那不是愛 葛羅莉亞 那是同情
That's not love, Gloria, that's empathy.

466
00:34:14,803 --> 00:34:16,754
想要我的建議嗎?
Want my advice?

467
00:34:16,764 --> 00:34:19,882
回家找妳老公  跟他做愛
Go home to your husband, make love to him.

468
00:34:19,892 --> 00:34:23,260
把對歐萊利的感情徹底根除
Stomp these feelings for O'Reily into the ground.

469
00:34:23,270 --> 00:34:27,770
妳要是不那樣 會惹上麻煩的
Because unless you do, you're gonna have trouble.

470
00:34:34,823 --> 00:34:37,649
嗯 看起來不太會留疤
Well, it doesn't look like there'll be much scarring.

471
00:34:37,659 --> 00:34:40,199
- 還會噁心想吐嗎?  - 不會
- How's the nausea? - Gone.

472
00:34:40,245 --> 00:34:42,956

474
00:34:47,377 --> 00:34:48,577
- 不  - 親我

475
00:34:48,587 --> 00:34:51,087
- 不要  - 拜託? 嘿

476
00:34:51,381 --> 00:34:55,083
妳知道我的事情 也知道我的感受
You know what I know, and you feel what I feel.

478
00:34:59,514 --> 00:35:02,392
萊恩!  警官
Ryan! Officer.

479
00:35:02,559 --> 00:35:05,839
- 把他帶回翡城  - 隨便

操
Fuck.

481
00:35:18,617 --> 00:35:21,828
嘿 女孩 看看我
Hey, girl, take a look at me

482
00:35:21,995 --> 00:35:27,834
讓我弄髒妳的思緒
Let me dirty up your mind, yeah

483
00:35:29,336 --> 00:35:32,422
我會解下妳冷硬的表層
I'll strip away your hard veneer

484
00:35:32,589 --> 00:35:36,926
讓我看看我能找到什麼
Let me see what I can find

485

- I'm trying. - I have to pee.

487
00:35:49,564 --> 00:35:53,683
你說要挖洞離開奧茲是認真的嗎?
You're serious about escaping from Oz by digging a hole?

488
00:35:53,693 --> 00:35:55,977
那是他們叫我地鼠的原因
That's why they call me the Mole.

489
00:35:55,987 --> 00:36:00,815
我曾經鑽進一個銀行金庫 在地下有20尺厚的牆
I once dug my way into a bank vault
with walls 20 feet into the ground.

490
00:36:00,825 --> 00:36:02,984

如果兩個人挖 會快一點 是吧?
If two people dig, it'll go faster, right?

493
00:36:09,792 --> 00:36:12,535
- 對  - 我過去是個建築師

00:38:30,223 --> 00:38:32,723
街道
Street.

524
00:38:32,892 --> 00:38:34,300
我才不要
I can't do that.

525
00:38:34,310 --> 00:38:36,886
我只是說  為什麼我們開會前不能先祈禱呢?
All I'm saying is that I don't see why we can't
start these meetings with a prayer.

526
00:38:36,896 --> 00:38:38,888
- 拜託 老兄  -大夥們
- Come on, man.  - Guys.

527
00:38:38,898 --> 00:38:41,683
- 薩伊德 你不同意嗎?  - 祈禱本身並無意義
- Said, don't you agree?  - A prayer in itself is meaningless

528
00:38:41,693 --> 00:38:44,018
除非祈禱者是真心相信
unless those who offer it do so from true belief.

529
00:38:44,028 --> 00:38:47,230
喔 別說這種廢話了  我們來講打炮這事行嗎?
Oh, man, enough of this shit. Can we just talk about sex?

530
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:49,732
對啊 對啊 我們想要夫妻探訪
Yeah, yeah, yeah. We wanna bring back conjugals.

531
00:38:49,742 --> 00:38:52,777
是  我已經在努力了 還有得等呢
Yeah, I'm working on it, fellas.
We're a long ways away.

532
00:38:52,787 --> 00:38:56,082
- 下一項  - 我對一件事很不滿
- Next.  - Yeah, I got a grievance.

533
00:38:56,249 --> 00:38:57,532

534
00:38:57,542 --> 00:39:00,034
- 有些人很臭  - 喔 阿德比希
- Certain guys stink.  - Oh, Adebisi.

535
00:39:00,044 --> 00:39:02,537
我知道有些人是從很遠的地方來的
I know some people come from far-away places

536
00:39:02,547 --> 00:39:04,706
那些地方的人不洗澡  但在美國
where they don't bathe, but in America,

537
00:39:04,716 --> 00:39:08,793
我想洗澡應該要強制執行  就算只是為了健康因素
I think washing should be mandatory,
if only for health-code reasons.

538
00:39:08,803 --> 00:39:11,129
偶爾洗個澡吧

替我塗肥皂?
Soaping me up, eh?

542
00:39:22,275 --> 00:39:25,393
那他媽就是你的洗澡水啦  那是你的洗澡水
There's your fucking bath right there. There's your fucking bath.

543
00:39:25,403 --> 00:39:28,855
好囉  我想該散會了
All right, I guess this meeting is adjourned.

阿德比希 回你的牢房  施貝塔 到我的辦公室
Adebisi, go back to your pod. Schibetta, to my office.

545
00:39:33,610 --> 00:39:36,140
我們不會再來開會的理由就是因為這樣啦 米克麥諾斯
This is why we'll never come
to your meetings again, McManus.

- You and me, we got a lot in common. - I don't think so.

549
00:39:58,894 --> 00:40:02,596
喔 我們都流著拉丁人的血  而且我們都在賣毒品
Well, we both have Latin blood and we both peddle tits.

550

我的話 我是賣街頭的毒品  海洛因  大麻
Me, I'm strictly a street-drug guy. Heroin, marijuana.

551
00:40:05,276 --> 00:40:07,434
你呢  因為你在監獄醫院工作

你為什麼要對我那麼慷慨 老兄?
Why you wanna be so generous with me, man?

557
00:40:24,753 --> 00:40:27,253
我想要阿德比希去死
I want Adebisi dead.

558
00:40:27,548 --> 00:40:30,848
怎樣 我看起來像個傻子是不是?
What, do I look like a mook to you?

You're offering me 60-40 and all I gotta do is kill Adebisi?

You're thinking, a spic kills the cocolo, they end up at war.

648
00:48:35,615 --> 00:48:38,858
我想在庭審的時候  你一直沒有那個機會
I'm afraid, in court, you never had that chance.

649
00:48:38,868 --> 00:48:41,027
有什麼差別嗎?
Would it have made a difference?

650
00:48:41,037 --> 00:48:42,737
不會
No.

651
00:48:42,747 --> 00:48:44,697
小姐
Lady,

652
00:48:44,707 --> 00:48:46,532
妳想要怎樣?
what do you want?

653
00:48:46,542 --> 00:48:50,129
我當了16年的法官
I've been a judge for 16 years.

654
00:48:50,713 --> 00:48:55,713
我判了超過2500件的案子  大部分的決定都是不錯的
I've made over 2500 decisions. Most of them were good.

655
00:48:56,052 --> 00:48:59,332
但只有一個案子讓我放不下  就是你的
But only one has haunted me. Yours.

656
00:49:00,931 --> 00:49:04,675
你看  我總是對我自己的公正感到驕傲
You see, I've always prided myself on being fair.

657
00:49:04,685 --> 00:49:09,148
在我的法庭中  正義是被視而不見的
That in my court, justice was truly blind.

658
00:49:13,778 --> 00:49:16,280
但你的案子
But in your case,

659
00:49:18,115 --> 00:49:20,615
那個小女孩
that little girl,

660
00:49:21,327 --> 00:49:23,829
她的父母哭得那麼慘
her parents crying,

661
00:49:24,622 --> 00:49:27,666
你是律師的一員
you being a member of the bar,

662
00:49:28,417 --> 00:49:31,795
之前又有酒駕的歷史
your prior arrest for DUl,

663
00:49:32,963 --> 00:49:36,050
這一切顯示的麻木不仁
the senselessness of it all,

664
00:49:36,675 --> 00:49:39,175
讓我停止了思考
it caught up with me.

665
00:49:41,722 --> 00:49:46,752
讓我易怒 又充滿了惡意
I was quick-tempered and spiteful to the point where...

666
00:49:49,813 --> 00:49:53,853
我甚至無法分辨我是不是給了你一個公正的審判
...l can't tell if I gave you a fair trial.

667
00:49:55,527 --> 00:49:58,145
現在 看到你這個樣子  我...
Now seeing you like this, I...

668
00:49:58,155 --> 00:50:02,525
我想  或許已經超過了你應得的懲罰
I think maybe the punishment exceeded the crime.

669
00:50:04,870 --> 00:50:07,370
而我...
And I'm...

670
00:50:10,334 --> 00:50:12,834
那個...
Well...

671
00:50:17,549 --> 00:50:20,677
妳怎樣?  很抱歉?
You're what? Sorry?

672
00:50:23,305 --> 00:50:27,855
法官大人  妳用了所有的力量來打擊我
Your Honour, you used all your power to crush me.

673
00:50:30,103 --> 00:50:32,603
但事實是
But the truth is,

674
00:50:33,231 --> 00:50:35,265
我殺了凱西 洛克威爾
I did kill Cathy Rockwell.

675
00:50:35,275 --> 00:50:39,811
就算我試過鑽法律漏洞來脫身
And as much as I tried to manipulate
the legal system to get off,

676
00:50:39,821 --> 00:50:44,409
來逃過這一切  我還是奪走了她的生命
to get out of it, I took her life.

677
00:50:47,120 --> 00:50:50,238
根據法律  每一個罪行有其對應的懲罰刑期
According to the law, each crime
is worth a certain number of years.

678
00:50:50,248 --> 00:50:55,253
妳判我在這個屎洞裡待上整整15年!
You gave me a maximum of 15 years in this fuckhole!

679
00:50:55,628 --> 00:51:00,123
是不是太多了? 太嚴厲了? 不夠? 我不知道
Is that too much? Too harsh? Not enough? I don't know.

680
00:51:00,133 --> 00:51:05,233
妳說妳放不下?  那我也是
You say you're haunted by what you did? Well, so am I.

681
00:51:06,473 --> 00:51:10,727
如果妳來這裡是要我原諒妳
And if you came here for me to forgive you...

682
00:51:13,354 --> 00:51:15,847
妳找錯人了
...you've come to the wrong man.

683
00:51:15,857 --> 00:51:20,236
他在凱西 洛克威爾死去那天就一起消失了
He ceased to exist the day Cathy Rockwell did.

684
00:51:22,071 --> 00:51:24,898
妳不可能會從他身上得到任何平靜
And you're not gonna get any more peace out of him

685
00:51:24,908 --> 00:51:27,408
就像我也不可能從她身上得到平靜
than I do out of her.

686
00:51:32,749 --> 00:51:36,669
對  這可真有療效  多謝啊
Yeah, this was very therapeutic. Thanks.

687
00:51:49,640 --> 00:51:52,140
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

688
00:51:53,311 --> 00:51:55,811
比雀先生?
Mr. Beecher?

689
00:52:08,075 --> 00:52:09,525
不
No.

690
00:52:09,535 --> 00:52:12,035
不
No.

691
00:52:12,246 --> 00:52:13,821
不要!
No!

692
00:52:13,831 --> 00:52:17,641
- 嘿 嘿 你...?  - 不要碰我
- Hey. Hey. Hey, you...?  - Don't touch me.

693
00:52:19,211 --> 00:52:22,121
- 我只是想說發生...  - 他媽的把你的手拿開
- I was just wondering what happ...
- Keep your fucking hands off me,

694
00:52:22,131 --> 00:52:24,631
你這死玻璃!
you fucking faggot!

695
00:52:27,011 --> 00:52:29,511
好吧
All right.

696
00:52:30,222 --> 00:52:32,722
好
All right.

697
00:52:56,540 --> 00:52:59,084
- 嘿  - 過得怎樣?
- Hey.  - How's it going?

698
00:52:59,251 --> 00:53:02,901
戴著這東西沖澡可真他媽折磨人
Showering with this baby on is a bitch.

699
00:53:09,011 --> 00:53:10,961
昨天晚上  我叫你玻璃  我...
About last night, calling you a faggot, I...

700
00:53:10,971 --> 00:53:15,521
忘了吧  我也作過惡夢
Forget about it. I've had my share of nightmares.

701
00:53:16,476 --> 00:53:21,346
聽著 那天在電話亭旁你幫我的時候  我告訴過你
Look, when you helped me out the
other day by the phones, I told you...

702
00:53:21,356 --> 00:53:23,856
我欠你
...l owe you.

703
00:53:24,526 --> 00:53:27,769
我來看的話  你和我  我們不像他們那些人
See, the way I figure it, you and me, we're not like the rest of them.

704
00:53:27,779 --> 00:53:30,564
拉丁人  黑人幫  雅利安人
The Latinos, the Homeboys, the Aryans,

705
00:53:30,574 --> 00:53:31,898
他們都有彼此撐腰
see, they all got each other.

706
00:53:31,908 --> 00:53:34,408
你和我...
You and me...

707
00:53:34,911 --> 00:53:40,782
你和我都無依無靠
You and me are standing out there
with our dicks swinging in the wind.

708
00:53:40,792 --> 00:53:44,286
我們應該要依靠彼此才對
We should be able to rely on each other.

709
00:53:44,296 --> 00:53:46,288
你懂嗎?
You know?

710
00:53:46,298 --> 00:53:48,623
信任對方
Trust each other.

711
00:53:48,633 --> 00:53:51,459
我很難信任別人
Well, it's hard for me to trust somebody.

712
00:53:51,469 --> 00:53:53,969
我也是
Me too.

713
00:53:54,764 --> 00:53:59,024
但我們有他媽一大把的時間待在一起  所以...
But we got a long fucking time together, so...

714
00:54:02,272 --> 00:54:06,372
我們就看看之後會怎樣吧  好嗎?
...why don't we see what happens, all right?

715
00:54:07,444 --> 00:54:09,944
好嗎?
All right?

716
00:54:12,615 --> 00:54:15,115
好
All right.

717
00:54:15,326 --> 00:54:17,826
很好
Good.

718
00:54:29,090 --> 00:54:31,749
- 你在這裡  你這吹簫的混帳  - 嘿 嘿冷靜  馬克
- There you are, you cocksucker.
- Hey, hey, calm down, Mark.

719
00:54:31,759 --> 00:54:34,085
他打斷了我的鼻子  你他媽的打斷了我的鼻子!
He broke my nose. You broke my motherfucking nose!

720
00:54:34,095 --> 00:54:36,462
嘿 嘿 用你最大的力氣來啊
Hey. Hey, give it your best shot.

721
00:54:36,472 --> 00:54:40,341
好了  退後  我們這裡沒事  警官
All right, back off. We're okay here, officer.

722
00:54:40,351 --> 00:54:42,851
快點  去運動消消氣
Come on, go work it off.

723
00:54:46,107 --> 00:54:48,607
所以  托比任務怎麼樣了?
So how goes Operation Toby?

724
00:54:48,651 --> 00:54:51,151
需要一點時間
It'll take some time.

725
00:54:51,237 --> 00:54:56,317
別擔心  早晚比雀會任我掌控
But don't worry, sooner or later, Beecher will be mine.

726
00:55:02,915 --> 00:55:06,502
男孩遇見女孩  男孩來了一發
Boy meets girl, boy gets laid.

727
00:55:06,669 --> 00:55:09,819
是什麼讓我們想要操別人?
What makes us wanna fuck somebody?

728
00:55:15,636 --> 00:55:19,505
是他們眼睛的顏色  他們雙腿的形狀
Is it the colour of their eyes, the shape of their legs,

729
00:55:19,515 --> 00:55:22,059
或是他們的鞋跟?
the spike of their heels?

730
00:55:22,226 --> 00:55:24,844
或是那些詩人告訴我們的
Or is it what the poets tell us?

731
00:55:24,854 --> 00:55:29,024
是更深層的東西  一種共享的失落
That there's something deeper, a shared loss.

732
00:55:29,191 --> 00:55:34,801
找到懂得我們傷憂深處的人的一種渴望
A longing to find someone
who knows the depth of our sadness.

733
00:55:35,114 --> 00:55:38,357
有些人花了一輩子尋找這樣的人
Some people search their whole lives for that someone.

734
00:55:38,367 --> 00:55:41,245
有些人找到了  有些人沒有
Some find them, some don't.

735
00:55:41,704 --> 00:55:45,698
有些人欺騙自己  相信自己陷入了愛河
Some fool themselves into believing they're in love.

736
00:55:45,708 --> 00:55:49,420
在奧茲裡  大部分的時候
And in Oz, most times,

737
00:55:49,586 --> 00:55:52,923
假象比現實更為美好
the illusion is better than reality.

738
00:56:29,573 --> 00:56:31,573
