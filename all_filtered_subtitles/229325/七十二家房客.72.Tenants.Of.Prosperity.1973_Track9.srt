2
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:22,581
每个人都有他的过去
Every person has a past, be it good or bad.

3
00:00:23,323 --> 00:00:25,791
不管是好的还是坏的
Every person has a past, be it good or bad.

4
00:00:26,426 --> 00:00:29,395
而且每个城市也都是一样
It's the same with every city.

5
00:00:30,163 --> 00:00:31,755
我现在所讲的
The story I'm about to tell

6
00:00:31,965 --> 00:00:34,490
就是一个城市过去的故事
is about a certain city's past

7
00:00:35,135 --> 00:00:37,899
而且过去很久了
a long, long time in the past.

8
00:01:37,797 --> 00:01:47,433
七十二家房客
The House of 72 Tenants

9
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:20,234
马路不平，电灯不亮
The roads are uneven, the lights are dim,

10
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,498
自来水也不清
and the tap water's mucky.

11
00:02:34,787 --> 00:02:36,482
你神经病
Damn this crazy tap!

12
00:02:42,228 --> 00:02:43,889
上海婆，这么早洗头？
Washing your hair so early, Shanghai Po?

13
00:02:45,298 --> 00:02:47,858
洗个死人头，这个水龙头发神经
Wash with what? This tap's gone crazy!

14
00:02:51,437 --> 00:02:51,801
四妹啊
Fourth Sister!

15
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:53,199
劳你驾拿个水桶过来
Could you please bring over a bucket

16
00:02:53,406 --> 00:02:54,373
跟我霸占一个位子
and claim me a place in the queue?

17
00:02:54,574 --> 00:02:55,768
等一会来洗呀
I'll come back to wash later.

18
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:01,242
大块头
Hey, Big Guy!

19
00:03:02,415 --> 00:03:04,007
你大清早去游水去了
Been swimming so early in the morning?

20
00:03:04,217 --> 00:03:06,208
游你个头，我是被水淋湿的
Swimming my foot! I got soaked!

21
00:03:06,419 --> 00:03:07,784
你还在这儿干什么？
What are you standing here for?

22
00:03:08,121 --> 00:03:09,281
快拿衣服给送出去
Go deliver the clothes already!

23
00:03:09,489 --> 00:03:11,787
拿了钱好去换大头，快啊！
Get the money and change it to HK dollars!

24
00:03:11,991 --> 00:03:13,185
去啦，去啦
All right, I'm going!

25
00:03:17,897 --> 00:03:20,331
杨伯，这么早就出去做生意
Uncle Yeung, off to work so early?

26
00:03:20,667 --> 00:03:22,100
臭虫多得能把人抬起
How can I sleep with all the bugs in my bed?

27
00:03:22,302 --> 00:03:23,132
怎么能睡得着了
How can I sleep with all the bugs in my bed?

28
00:03:23,336 --> 00:03:24,166
是啊
True!

29
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:25,860
我欠你一包烟钱还没给你
I still owe you for the cigarettes.

30
00:03:27,106 --> 00:03:28,767
上海佬，算你买了便宜货了
You got them cheap, Shanghai Man.

31
00:03:28,975 --> 00:03:29,703
早！
Morning!

32
00:03:29,909 --> 00:03:32,070
这点钱今天只能买六根烟
This much will only buy 6 cigarettes today.

33
00:03:32,278 --> 00:03:33,176
改天再多给你点儿
I'll pay the extra some other time.

34
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:36,041
不用，天天涨价，关你什么事？
It's OK. Prices rise daily. Not your fault.

35
00:03:37,183 --> 00:03:38,616
韩师母早！     早！
Morning Mrs Han! - Morning!

36
00:03:38,818 --> 00:03:41,048
怎么，你作天又熬通宵啊
Been working all night again?

37
00:03:41,254 --> 00:03:42,186
是！
Yes!

38
00:03:42,789 --> 00:03:44,120
快点上去吧
You better go upstairs quickly.

39
00:03:44,324 --> 00:03:47,418
你们韩先生昨天又咳嗽了一夜
Mr. Han was coughing all night again.

40
00:03:49,395 --> 00:03:50,327
谢谢
Thank you!

41
00:03:54,367 --> 00:03:55,857
大学毕业生
College graduate!

42
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:18,015
你还没睡？
Haven't you gone to bed yet?

43
00:04:19,125 --> 00:04:23,255
没有，我想赶完这篇稿子去报馆
No, I want to finish this for the paper.

44
00:04:37,543 --> 00:04:39,010
你还不去睡
Why aren't you asleep yet?

45
00:04:39,579 --> 00:04:42,571
我买了点药回来，先去煎给你喝
I bought some medicine. I'll fix it for you.

46
00:04:58,564 --> 00:04:59,462
韩师母早！
Good morning, Mrs. Han!

47
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:00,360
早！
Morning!

48
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:02,332
早！
Morning!

49
00:05:06,372 --> 00:05:09,364
韩先生大学毕业到现在一直失业
Mr Han's an unemployed university graduate.

50
00:05:09,642 --> 00:05:11,132
韩师母念完书又去做舞女
After classes, Mrs Han works as a hostess.

51
00:05:11,344 --> 00:05:12,368
这是个什么世界
What sort of world is this?

52
00:05:13,179 --> 00:05:14,544
我看你也好不到那儿去
I reckon you're no better!

53
00:05:14,747 --> 00:05:16,510
快去排队拿水       好
Quick! Go line up for water! - OK.

54
00:05:18,184 --> 00:05:20,152
这个给你玩
Here's something for you to play with.

55
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:27,152
福哥，这么早就开工啊！
Off to work so early, Brother Fook?

56
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,156
是了，陈伯
That's right, Uncle Chan.

57
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:31,293
你也知道，早点卖了，早点回家
The sooner it's sold, the sooner I'm home.

58
00:05:31,497 --> 00:05:32,395
如果去晚一点
The later I go to Boss Chin's

59
00:05:32,598 --> 00:05:34,657
拿这些现钞到钱老板去换大头
to exchange this cash,

60
00:05:34,867 --> 00:05:35,765
差好多呢？
the fewer HK dollars it's worth!

61
00:05:36,102 --> 00:05:38,297
阿福啊！     什么事？
Ah Fook! - What is it?

62
00:05:38,805 --> 00:05:39,703
你还不去看看
Go see if the cheongsam's dry yet.

63
00:05:39,906 --> 00:05:40,930
那件旗袍干了没有？
Go see if the cheongsam's dry yet.

64
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:42,266
是，老婆大人
Yes, almighty wife!

65
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:47,335
小福怎么样？
How's Little Fook?

66
00:05:49,282 --> 00:05:50,613
好像还有一点点发烧
He still seems to have a slight temperature.

67
00:05:50,817 --> 00:05:52,910
不要紧，等我回来带他去看医生
I'll take him to the doctor when I'm back.

68
00:06:00,393 --> 00:06:01,360
早！
Morning!

69
00:06:10,103 --> 00:06:11,263
早！
Morning!

70
00:06:12,472 --> 00:06:13,769
上海婆      阿香回来了
Shanghai Po. - Ah Heung, you're back.

71
00:06:15,408 --> 00:06:17,035
对了，肥皂又涨价了
Yes. Soap's gone up again.

72
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:19,004
昨天这些钱能买两条
I could have bought two bars yesterday

73
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:20,873
今天只能买一条了
for the same price as one today!

74
00:06:21,948 --> 00:06:24,439
这种日子叫我怎么过啊？
How will I ever get through times like these?

75
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:26,311
上海婆啊！水来了没有
Shanghai Po, is there water yet?

76
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:28,043
来了，在发神经病
It's coming. Damn crazy tap!

77
00:06:29,088 --> 00:06:31,079
算了，我先上去拿个桶排队
I'll go get a bucket and queue up.

78
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:33,087
好，你要快点啊！
You better hurry.

79
00:06:33,359 --> 00:06:35,327
上海婆      早！
Shanghai Po. - Good morning!

80
00:06:35,528 --> 00:06:36,790
金医生，你早！
Good morning, Dr Kim.

81
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:40,196
上海婆，给我熨熨裤子
Could you iron my trousers please?

82
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:42,162
真的吗，金医生
Really, Dr Kim?

83
00:06:42,368 --> 00:06:44,836
你搬来这么久，还是第一次出诊
Your first house call since moving here!

84
00:06:45,538 --> 00:06:48,063
没办法，从山东到此地来
Can't be helped. Moving here from Shantung,

85
00:06:48,274 --> 00:06:49,764
人生路不熟
I don't know anyone around here.

86
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:52,442
再说做医生要靠运气的
Besides, even a doctor needs luck.

87
00:06:52,645 --> 00:06:54,112
对了，金医生，这回出诊
This time, Dr Kim, you should charge more.

88
00:06:54,313 --> 00:06:55,439
怎么也得收贵点了
This time, Dr Kim, you should charge more.

89
00:06:55,648 --> 00:06:59,584
不…那不行，做医生要有医德
No, I couldn't. A doctor must have ethics.

90
00:06:59,786 --> 00:07:00,684
我在山东的时候
In Shantung, I never charged the poor.

91
00:07:00,887 --> 00:07:02,650
穷人看病不要钱的
In Shantung, I never charged the poor.

92
00:07:03,122 --> 00:07:04,521
好，那我先挂个号了
In that case, I'll register with you!

93
00:07:04,824 --> 00:07:06,291
不过像我们这些穷人
But a poor people like me

94
00:07:06,492 --> 00:07:08,756
情愿死也不愿意生病
would rather die than be sick.

95
00:07:09,228 --> 00:07:10,661
对了，我先跟你熨裤子了
So, I'd better go iron your trousers.

96
00:07:10,863 --> 00:07:12,160
谢谢      不用
Thank you. - Don't mention it.

97
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:16,257
老婆啊！
Oh, wifey!

98
00:07:16,569 --> 00:07:18,696
你看，浆糊又给老鼠吃光了
Look. The rats have eaten up the paste again.

99
00:07:19,071 --> 00:07:19,969
那怎么办？
What are we going to do?

100
00:07:20,706 --> 00:07:23,140
到和记去借半碗面粉再打一碗
Borrow some flour from Wo Kee to make more.

101
00:07:23,509 --> 00:07:26,171
不成，上次借的我们还没还呢
We can't. We still owe them from last time.

102
00:07:26,579 --> 00:07:27,603
明儿一块再还吧
We'll give it all back tomorrow.

103
00:07:27,814 --> 00:07:29,076
没浆糊怎么干活啊？
How can I work without glue?

104
00:07:31,851 --> 00:07:32,317
四妹     早！
Fourth sister. - Morning!

105
00:07:32,518 --> 00:07:33,542
有面粉吗？
Do you have any flour?

106
00:07:33,853 --> 00:07:35,787
刚用完了，爸爸去买还没回来
Just ran out. But dad's gone to buy some.

107
00:07:36,923 --> 00:07:40,290
陈嫂，浆糊给老鼠吃光了
Mrs Chan, the rats got at the paste again?

108
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:42,056
是啊！
Yes!

109
00:07:42,328 --> 00:07:44,193
爸爸，怎么只有半袋面粉啊
How come there's only half a bag of flour?

110
00:07:44,931 --> 00:07:46,865
你不知道呀，又涨价了
Don't you know, the price went up again.

111
00:07:47,066 --> 00:07:48,294
昨天的钱可以买一袋
The price of a whole bag yesterday

112
00:07:48,501 --> 00:07:49,593
今天买半袋
could only buy half a bag today!

113
00:07:50,503 --> 00:07:51,731
这生意怎做呀
How are we going to stay in business?

114
00:07:52,104 --> 00:07:52,798
那我们也可以一样
We can do the same.

115
00:07:53,005 --> 00:07:54,063
把油条炸少一点
We can always make our fritters thinner.

116
00:07:55,174 --> 00:07:56,038
现在我们的油条
They're already thin as chopsticks now.

117
00:07:56,242 --> 00:07:57,266
都已经像油炸筷子了
They're already thin as chopsticks now.

118
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:59,502
再炸小一点不成油炸牙签
Any thinner and they'll be toothpicks!

119
00:08:02,582 --> 00:08:04,709
陈嫂，是不是要面粉打浆糊？
Mrs Chan, didn't you say you need some flour?

120
00:08:05,017 --> 00:08:06,143
现在不用了
No, I don't need it anymore.

121
00:08:06,352 --> 00:08:07,580
来，来
Come on,

122
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:09,553
没有浆糊怎么作活呢？
How can a tailor work without paste?

123
00:08:09,755 --> 00:08:12,246
不行了，不行了
No, no.

124
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,856
水来了，水来了
The water's coming! The water's coming!

125
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:20,465
四妹啊
Fourth Sister!

126
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:22,793
麻烦你拿个桶先帮我装点水吧！
Please get a bucket and fetch me some!

127
00:08:24,537 --> 00:08:26,004
来，来
Come on.

128
00:08:26,205 --> 00:08:28,673
阿香，我想先用你让让我好不好
Ah Heung, could you let me go first?

129
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:29,671
好
Sure.

130
00:08:33,946 --> 00:08:35,470
你等着用，那我先给你吧！
You need it right away. You go ahead.

131
00:08:35,681 --> 00:08:36,841
谢谢
Many thanks!

132
00:08:38,417 --> 00:08:42,513
楼下关水龙头，你们想造反啊
Turn it off downstairs! Is this a rebellion?

133
00:08:42,722 --> 00:08:44,155
明知道我起床要洗脸
You know very well I need to wash my face!

134
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:45,381
干么把水开得那么大
And yet you turn on the tap full blast!

135
00:08:49,128 --> 00:08:50,425
我们怎知道你起床
How are we to know you just got up?

136
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:52,925
而且水刚来，我们还没装够呢
Anyway, we haven't drawn our fill yet.

137
00:08:53,132 --> 00:08:56,465
妈的，一大早你们就气我啊
Giving me grief first thing in the morning!

138
00:08:56,669 --> 00:08:57,795
好，我下去给你们点厉害看看
Damn it! I'll come down and show you.

139
00:08:58,471 --> 00:08:59,233
妈下来了，怎么办？
Ma's coming down. What shall I do?

140
00:08:59,438 --> 00:09:01,065
怕什么，又不关你的事
So what? It's got nothing to do with you.

141
00:09:01,274 --> 00:09:01,569
我…
I...

142
00:09:01,774 --> 00:09:02,866
怕怕怕什么，干么怕她
What are you so afraid of her for?

143
00:09:05,678 --> 00:09:07,771
不许用，你们他妈的
You're not allowed to use it, damn it!

144
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:09,948
什么时候用完才能轮到我洗脸
How long do I have to wait to wash my face?

145
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:12,946
八姑！八姑你这也不对
That's not fair, Pat Koo.

146
00:09:13,152 --> 00:09:14,881
你这可就强词夺理了
You're being unreasonable.

147
00:09:15,521 --> 00:09:17,386
你不是装了条私人水管子
Didn't you install a personal water pipe?

148
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:17,919
对呀！
That's right!

149
00:09:18,124 --> 00:09:18,988
什么私人水管子
What do you mean "personal"?

150
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:20,586
你们把水开得这么大
With you turning on the tap full blast,

151
00:09:20,793 --> 00:09:21,953
水怎么冲得上去啊
how can any water get up there?

152
00:09:22,528 --> 00:09:25,326
妈，我现在不是在排队接水吗？
Ma, can't you see I'm already queuing?

153
00:09:27,066 --> 00:09:29,694
你还嘴硬呀，昨天晚上我吩咐你
Shut up! I told you last night to come early.

154
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:32,336
早点下来排队，怎么才排第二
How come you're second in the queue?

155
00:09:33,105 --> 00:09:35,130
你别动手，是阿香让给我的
Don't hit her. Ah Heung let me go first.

156
00:09:36,509 --> 00:09:38,204
是你让给别人
You let someone else go first!

157
00:09:38,477 --> 00:09:39,535
你明知我等水洗脸
When you know I need water for washing!

158
00:09:39,745 --> 00:09:41,372
你把水让给别人，你个死丫头
You stupid girl!

159
00:09:43,215 --> 00:09:45,843
你要洗脸，我们楼上还有一大缸
We still have a big bucket upstairs.

160
00:09:46,986 --> 00:09:48,510
关你们什么事
It's none of your business!

161
00:09:48,721 --> 00:09:50,052
看我一会儿收拾你
Stupid girl! I'll fix you later!

162
00:09:50,389 --> 00:09:52,357
还不滚回去，滚上去
Get the hell back upstairs!

163
00:09:52,558 --> 00:09:53,718
他妈的
Damn it!

164
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:59,690
妈什么，我有水是我的事
What are you cursing about?

165
00:09:59,899 --> 00:10:01,264
我还拿去卖呢？
It's my water. If I like, I can even sell it.

166
00:10:01,701 --> 00:10:04,192
水啊，留着你自己去卖吧！
Right, you better sell it then!

167
00:10:04,537 --> 00:10:08,029
去你妈的，你们听着
Damn the whole lot of you! Now listen!

168
00:10:08,975 --> 00:10:11,535
我现在有个新的规矩
I'm making a new rule.

169
00:10:11,877 --> 00:10:13,606
从明天开始等我用完了
From tomorrow, no one gets water

170
00:10:13,813 --> 00:10:14,745
你们才能用
until after I've finished using it.

171
00:10:15,681 --> 00:10:16,648
这就不对了
That's not right!

172
00:10:17,216 --> 00:10:19,309
我们每个人都交一份水费的
We all pay a share of the water bill.

173
00:10:19,518 --> 00:10:20,485
哎呀！
That's right!

174
00:10:20,686 --> 00:10:23,678
你还好意思说，我问你
You dare bring that up? Let me ask you:

175
00:10:23,889 --> 00:10:26,687
你交一份水费，你用多少水？
how much water do you use for your share?

176
00:10:27,693 --> 00:10:28,921
你怎么不记得了
Don't you remember now?

177
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:30,459
我们不是讲好的吗
Didn't we agree on the matter?

178
00:10:30,663 --> 00:10:32,756
我免费跟你洗熨衣服
I wash and iron your clothes for free

179
00:10:32,965 --> 00:10:34,592
你才答应我用这么多的水的
in return for using so much water.

180
00:10:37,403 --> 00:10:38,802
你不要紧的吧
If it's all the same to you, fine!

181
00:10:39,438 --> 00:10:42,100
好，以后我就不用你替我洗熨
I don't need you to wash and iron from now on.

182
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:42,637
好呀
Fine!

183
00:10:42,842 --> 00:10:44,707
你们大家都听着
Now listen, all of you!

184
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:47,605
我规定由现在开始
From now on, the rule is each household

185
00:10:47,913 --> 00:10:50,643
每一家，每一户，只许用一桶水
can only have one tub of water a day.

186
00:10:52,251 --> 00:10:53,115
那怎么行？
No way!

187
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:54,081
真他妈的滚蛋！
Damn that bloody bitch!

188
00:10:55,121 --> 00:10:55,815
阿福！
Ah Fook!

189
00:10:56,122 --> 00:10:56,952
我马上就回来
I'll be right back.

190
00:10:58,157 --> 00:10:59,181
真是多管闲事
Why don't you mind your own business?

191
00:11:00,026 --> 00:11:01,357
你这不是明明对付我吗？
You're deliberately targeting me!

192
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:02,754
我们开洗衣店的
We run a laundry!

193
00:11:02,962 --> 00:11:04,429
一天一桶水怎么够啊
How can a tub of water a day be enough?

194
00:11:04,764 --> 00:11:05,662
不用怕，上海婆
Don't worry, Shanghai Po,

195
00:11:06,465 --> 00:11:07,295
我白杬福帮助你
I, Olive Vendor Fook, am on your side.

196
00:11:09,368 --> 00:11:10,926
臭小子，口气倒不小
Big talk, little man.

197
00:11:11,137 --> 00:11:11,933
我看你怎么帮助她
What good are you going to do her?

198
00:11:12,238 --> 00:11:15,503
我省点，我每天给你半桶水
I can spare you half of my daily water.

199
00:11:15,708 --> 00:11:17,642
对，对
Right, right.

200
00:11:17,843 --> 00:11:18,969
你们造反啊？你们造反啊？
What's this, a rebellion? A rebellion?

201
00:11:19,779 --> 00:11:21,906
是不是，上海婆，你怕什么？
See? There's nothing to fear.

202
00:11:22,114 --> 00:11:23,411
这儿有七十二家人
There are 72 tenants here.

203
00:11:23,616 --> 00:11:25,447
每天就有三十六桶水
That's 36 buckets of water a day.

204
00:11:25,651 --> 00:11:29,052
你开茶馆都够啊     谢谢
Enough even for a restaurant! -Thank you!

205
00:11:30,022 --> 00:11:32,183
八姑，听见了没有
Hear that, Pat Koo?

206
00:11:32,458 --> 00:11:35,484
以后你的衣服要自己洗自己烫啦
You'll have to wash your own clothes now!

207
00:11:35,961 --> 00:11:38,862
我们还是继续排队接水
We'll continue lining up for water,

208
00:11:39,498 --> 00:11:41,056
我现在要跟金医生烫裤子
and I'll go iron Dr Kim's pants.

209
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:43,995
水满了你们帮我关就可以了
When my tub's full, please turn it off.

210
00:11:46,305 --> 00:11:46,703
肥婆
Fat pig!

211
00:11:46,906 --> 00:11:48,897
八姑，告诉你
Pat Koo, let me tell you,

212
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:51,870
有时做人就不能做得太绝
one should never push people too far.

213
00:11:52,078 --> 00:11:59,177
好比说，八姑你做事不应该
You'll get your comeuppance

214
00:11:59,485 --> 00:12:05,890
独占水喉报应就要来
if you try to hog the water for yourself.

215
00:12:08,494 --> 00:12:10,121
阿福，你快点回来吧
Ah Fook, come back here.

216
00:12:10,329 --> 00:12:11,762
喝了粥该做生意了
Have some congee and get to work.

217
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:16,893
八姑，我要回去喝粥，回头见
Eighth Aunt, I'm having congee. See you!

218
00:12:24,944 --> 00:12:28,004
上海婆出来，出来
Come here, Shanghai Po!

219
00:12:28,214 --> 00:12:30,546
你干嘛呀，我在熨裤子嘛？
What do you want? I'm ironing!

220
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:33,476
你真是，你干什么呀
What are you trying to do?

221
00:12:34,854 --> 00:12:38,051
我八姑是出了名的骂大街的
I'm known as the battleaxe around here,

222
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:40,248
你来跟我找岔子，你什么意思？
and you dare pick a fight with me?

223
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:41,583
那是你自己找的
You picked the fight yourself.

224
00:12:41,794 --> 00:12:45,821
劳驾你以后的衣服自己洗自己熨
Now you can wash and iron your own clothes.

225
00:12:46,899 --> 00:12:51,097
熨，熨，熨，糟了
Iron...iron...iron...oh no!

226
00:12:52,805 --> 00:12:55,569
糟糕！糟糕！这是金医生的裤子
Oh no! These are Dr Kim's trousers!

227
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:57,242
他只有就么一条裤子
They're the only pair he has!

228
00:12:57,443 --> 00:12:58,671
还等着出诊呢
And he has a housecall to make!

229
00:12:58,878 --> 00:13:00,277
现在破了，这怎么呢？
They're ruined! What do I do now?

230
00:13:01,247 --> 00:13:03,807
上海婆，这就恭喜你了
Congratulations, Shanghai Po!

231
00:13:04,016 --> 00:13:06,280
这是善有善报，恶有恶报
As you sow, so shall you reap!

232
00:13:06,485 --> 00:13:07,816
你看金医生的这条裤子
See how nicely you've ironed

233
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:10,454
给你熨得多漂亮
Dr Kim's trousers!

234
00:13:10,923 --> 00:13:12,788
上海婆、上海婆
Shanghai Po! Shanghai Po!

235
00:13:13,859 --> 00:13:15,156
我的裤子熨好了吗？
Are my trousers ready?

236
00:13:15,561 --> 00:13:16,425
我…
I...

237
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:21,191
熨好了，而且熨得见膀呢
Ironed crisply, all ironed to a crisp.

238
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,730
什么贝粉，还卤玉米呢？
What do you mean, ironed to a crisp?

239
00:13:25,437 --> 00:13:26,631
好香啊
Smells good, too.

240
00:13:29,508 --> 00:13:31,601
上海婆，等会回来再给你钱
Shanghai Po, I'll pay you later.

241
00:13:32,511 --> 00:13:35,742
金医生啊，你看看你这条腿啊
Dr Kim, look at your leg.

242
00:13:38,951 --> 00:13:41,749
上海婆，你可真害苦我了
Shanghai Po! What have you done?

243
00:13:41,954 --> 00:13:43,319
我只有这一条裤子
This is my only pair of trousers!

244
00:13:43,522 --> 00:13:45,854
第一次出诊，不穿裤子怎么行呢
My first housecall, and I have no trousers!

245
00:13:46,158 --> 00:13:48,092
金医生，其实也不关我的事
Dr Kim, it's not really my fault!

246
00:13:48,294 --> 00:13:49,886
都是那个骚货
It's all because of that bitch!

247
00:13:50,095 --> 00:13:51,084
我正在熨裤子
Picking a quarrel while I was ironing!

248
00:13:51,297 --> 00:13:52,662
她硬把我拉出来吵架
Picking a quarrel while I was ironing!

249
00:13:54,366 --> 00:13:57,301
你熨坏人家裤子怎么来怪我
You burned his pants. Don't blame me!

250
00:13:57,870 --> 00:13:58,859
这就不对了
That's not right!

251
00:13:59,071 --> 00:14:00,003
我们大伙都看见
We all saw it.

252
00:14:00,206 --> 00:14:02,174
你把她拉来吵架的，你还赖呀
You dragged her out. Don't deny it!

253
00:14:02,541 --> 00:14:03,508
关你什么事？
What business is it of yours?

254
00:14:04,276 --> 00:14:06,244
不错，是我叫她出来
That's right, I did call her out,

255
00:14:06,445 --> 00:14:07,878
可没叫她熨坏人家的裤子
I didn't tell her to burn the pants!

256
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:12,947
不过我也讲一句公道话
But I can say a fair word too:

257
00:14:13,152 --> 00:14:14,141
你要她赔
if you want compensation,

258
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:16,981
这帮穷鬼是怎样也赔不起了
there's no way this pauper can pay up.

259
00:14:17,623 --> 00:14:19,284
不过那条裤子是谁的
so it's just hard luck to Dr Kim!

260
00:14:19,491 --> 00:14:21,516
谁就活该倒霉
so it's just hard luck to Dr Kim!

261
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:24,996
八姑啊，你还说风凉话
Pat Koo, what a thing to say!

262
00:14:25,564 --> 00:14:28,658
其实说起来这条裤子应该你赔
Actually, you should pay for the trousers.

263
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:29,630
什么？
What?

264
00:14:29,835 --> 00:14:31,302
对，你赔
Yes, you should pay.

265
00:14:31,503 --> 00:14:32,697
不要吵！
Shut up!

266
00:14:34,306 --> 00:14:35,466
你们想造反啊？
What's this, a rebellion?

267
00:14:37,476 --> 00:14:39,137
你们这帮王八蛋
You bunch of bastards!

268
00:14:39,345 --> 00:14:41,813
一大清早想多睡一会都不行，吵…
Making so much noise in the morning!

269
00:14:42,014 --> 00:14:42,708
什么事？
What's going on?

270
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:44,577
这个上海婆
This Shanghainese woman

271
00:14:44,783 --> 00:14:47,377
熨坏人家裤子她们想要我赔
wants me to pay for trousers she burnt!

272
00:14:48,287 --> 00:14:49,720
你讲不讲理你
What sort of reasoning is that?

273
00:14:50,022 --> 00:14:52,149
你熨坏别人的裤子叫我赔
You burn someone's pants, and I should pay?

274
00:14:52,358 --> 00:14:53,154
赔什么赔？
Pay on what basis?

275
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:56,422
别说不是我太子炳熨的
I wasn't the one who burned the pants,

276
00:14:56,629 --> 00:14:57,618
就是我熨坏的
and even if I was,

277
00:14:57,830 --> 00:15:00,298
我不想赔的话我就是不赔
I wouldn't pay if I don't feel like it!

278
00:15:02,334 --> 00:15:03,699
真是太不讲道理的
How unreasonable can you get?

279
00:15:06,171 --> 00:15:07,103
山东佬
Shantung Man,

280
00:15:07,473 --> 00:15:09,373
你的裤子要是怕给别人熨坏的
if you don't want your pants burnt,

281
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:11,338
你别拿给别人熨
you should iron them yourself!

282
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:14,770
这是天灾人祸，各安天命
It's an accident, an act of God,

283
00:15:15,114 --> 00:15:16,103
这还有什么好说的
what more is there to be said?

284
00:15:17,216 --> 00:15:19,047
哎，我只有一条裤
But these are the only trousers I have!

285
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:20,275
还等着出诊呢？
And I still have a housecall to make!

286
00:15:21,153 --> 00:15:23,781
你等上吊也没有用，坏都坏了
Well, it's no use crying over split milk.

287
00:15:24,356 --> 00:15:26,119
我告诉你，你算是走运啦
I tell you, you should count yourself lucky.

288
00:15:26,325 --> 00:15:27,656
要是裤子被人偷了
If they'd been stolen instead,

289
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:28,827
连渣都没有啊？
you wouldn't have anything left!

290
00:15:29,728 --> 00:15:31,195
你看不是挺好的吗
See? Isn't that fine?

291
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:33,091
把它改成短裤
You can turn them into a pair of shorts.

292
00:15:33,299 --> 00:15:35,028
跟童子军一样，多神奇
Just like the Boy Scouts. Marvellous!

293
00:15:36,302 --> 00:15:39,066
同时现在天热，穿短裤多凉快嘛
Shorts are ideal for this hot weather.

294
00:15:40,139 --> 00:15:42,369
糟了，我这儿还有一条裤子
Oh no. My son only has one pair of pants.

295
00:15:44,076 --> 00:15:45,270
这是我的裤子吗
Are these mine?

296
00:15:46,211 --> 00:15:48,702
你看…还有个金字
Look...there's my name, Kim!

297
00:15:50,516 --> 00:15:52,279
我跟你说，你要倒起霉来
Like I said, when a man's unlucky,

298
00:15:52,484 --> 00:15:53,473
好好的裤子
even his trousers will lose a leg.

299
00:15:53,686 --> 00:15:55,654
两条腿会变成一条腿
even his trousers will lose a leg.

300
00:15:55,854 --> 00:15:58,049
熨破了，那还不活该呢
You can't blame anyone else

301
00:15:59,124 --> 00:16:01,524
你看他那德性，还有得倒霉呢
He's got more bad luck coming.

302
00:16:01,727 --> 00:16:02,716
对呀！
How true!

303
00:16:03,429 --> 00:16:07,593
周炳根，糟了，炳哥
Chow Bing-Ken. Oh no! Brother Bing!

304
00:16:07,933 --> 00:16:09,332
知不知呀这是你的
Do you know this is yours?

305
00:16:11,904 --> 00:16:13,064
阿炳，糟糕了
Ah Bing! This was made 2 days ago!

306
00:16:13,272 --> 00:16:14,739
这条裤子前两天才做的
Ah Bing! This was made 2 days ago!

307
00:16:15,441 --> 00:16:18,103
上海婆，你别溜
Shanghai Po, stay where you are!

308
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:19,641
我告诉你，你赔我的裤子
I'll sue you! You'll pay me back!

309
00:16:19,845 --> 00:16:21,107
我要你赔我妈的
You'll bloody well pay me back!

310
00:16:22,614 --> 00:16:24,639
炳哥，你要怕人熨烂裤子
Ah Bing, if you don't want your pants burnt,

311
00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:25,748
就别找人熨
you should iron them yourself!

312
00:16:25,951 --> 00:16:29,011
这叫天灾人祸，各安天命
It's an accident, an act of God,

313
00:16:29,221 --> 00:16:30,188
没得赔
why should anyone pay?

314
00:16:32,858 --> 00:16:35,349
幸好没被人家偷了去
Count yourself lucky they weren't stolen,

315
00:16:35,561 --> 00:16:38,860
要是被人家偷去就连渣都没了
otherwise you'd have nothing left!

316
00:16:39,164 --> 00:16:42,065
现在多好，把它改成短裤
But now you can turn them into shorts,

317
00:16:42,267 --> 00:16:45,725
像童子军一样多神气，又凉快
just like the Boy Scouts. Cool too!

318
00:16:46,572 --> 00:16:49,166
对不起，我要拿药箱出诊了
Excuse me, I must go make my housecall.

319
00:16:53,579 --> 00:16:55,945
你怎么拿裤子给那该死的熨啊？
Why give the pants to that damn woman?

320
00:16:56,815 --> 00:16:58,282
不是我给她熨的吗
I didn't!

321
00:16:58,484 --> 00:17:00,042
是我叫阿香自己熨的吗
I told Ah Heung to iron it!

322
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:04,080
阿香     来啦
Ah Heung! - Coming!

323
00:17:04,823 --> 00:17:07,018
妈，什么事啊！
What is it, ma?

324
00:17:07,393 --> 00:17:10,260
我问你，谁叫你把裤子给上海婆熨
Who told you to give the pants to her?

325
00:17:10,996 --> 00:17:11,963
不是你叫我的吗？
You did!

326
00:17:12,364 --> 00:17:14,798
你说给上海婆洗是不要钱的
You said Shanghai Po does it for free,

327
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:17,999
你还说这点便宜不占
and only a fool wouldn't take advantage.

328
00:17:18,203 --> 00:17:19,329
简直是王八蛋
Godammit! Stupid girl, I'll kill you!

329
00:17:20,439 --> 00:17:22,907
你这死丫头，我非打死你…
Godammit! Stupid girl, I'll kill you!

330
00:17:23,108 --> 00:17:24,507
住手，不许打
Hold it! Don't hit her!

331
00:17:26,845 --> 00:17:27,743
你怎么啦
What's the matter with you?

332
00:17:27,946 --> 00:17:29,436
他叫你不要动你就不要动
He tells you to stop and you stop.

333
00:17:29,648 --> 00:17:30,171
你那么听话
Why are you so obedient?

334
00:17:30,382 --> 00:17:31,610
站着跟个死人一样
Standing there like a zombie!

335
00:17:33,786 --> 00:17:34,810
死小子，你是谁？
Who are you, you damned kid?

336
00:17:35,854 --> 00:17:37,913
我是谁，你们听着
Who am l? Listen well.

337
00:17:39,158 --> 00:17:41,991
我就是这条街九十六号门牌
I live at No. 96 on this street,

338
00:17:42,194 --> 00:17:44,662
上海婆隔壁，包租婆楼下
next to Shanghai Po, below the landlady,

339
00:17:45,431 --> 00:17:46,921
公共楼梯的左边
to the left of the communal staircase,

340
00:17:47,132 --> 00:17:48,690
潮州卖烟佬房间里
in the Chiu Chow cigarette vendor's room,

341
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:50,459
弄在墙上的那个床铺
on the bunk you fixed halfway up the ceiling.

342
00:17:50,669 --> 00:17:52,000
发记补鞋的发仔
I'm Fat Chai, the cobbler,

343
00:17:52,638 --> 00:17:55,630
我也是这儿七十二家房客之一
one of the 72 tenants here as well.

344
00:17:56,608 --> 00:17:57,666
怎么这个人我不认识他？
Why haven't I seen this guy before?

345
00:17:58,410 --> 00:17:59,672
他搬过来没几天
He only moved in a few days ago.

346
00:18:01,713 --> 00:18:03,112
那就难怪
No wonder.

347
00:18:05,017 --> 00:18:07,508
小飞，你知不知道我是谁？
Do you know who I am, kid?

348
00:18:08,053 --> 00:18:08,576
不知道
No.

349
00:18:08,787 --> 00:18:09,754
那我告诉你
Then, let me tell you.

350
00:18:09,955 --> 00:18:12,253
我是这儿包租婆八姑的丈夫
I'm the husband of the landlady, Pat Koo.

351
00:18:12,624 --> 00:18:14,854
我在这附近上至八十岁的老头子
Everyone around here,

352
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:16,618
下至三岁的鼻涕虫
from 80 year-old codgers to tiny tots of 3,

353
00:18:16,995 --> 00:18:18,826
东至东山、西至西村
east to Tungshan, west to West Village,

354
00:18:19,031 --> 00:18:20,794
南至河南、北到火车站
south to Henan, north to the train station,

355
00:18:20,999 --> 00:18:22,933
那个不知道我太子炳啊？
everyone knows me, Master Bing!

356
00:18:23,802 --> 00:18:25,064
就是我不知道
Everyone except me.

357
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:29,004
你这死小子
God damned kid!

358
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:30,869
我管女儿你也管得着
How I treat my daughter's not your business!

359
00:18:31,276 --> 00:18:32,265
我当然管得着
Of course it's my business!

360
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:33,942
我是路见不平，拔刀相助
I must defend the weak against the strong!

361
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:36,142
什么？
What?

362
00:18:36,348 --> 00:18:37,940
路见不平，拔刀相助啊
Defend the weak against the strong?

363
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:39,478
你知不知道阿香是什么人？
Do you know what Ah Heung is?

364
00:18:42,354 --> 00:18:42,945
女人
She's a woman.

365
00:18:43,355 --> 00:18:44,117
那你是什么人？
And what are you?

366
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:45,981
男人
A man!

367
00:18:46,925 --> 00:18:47,823
你是她的男人
You're her man?

368
00:18:48,293 --> 00:18:50,853
你这该死的，管闲事管到我头上
You bloody kid, poking your nose in!

369
00:18:51,196 --> 00:18:52,026
等我先问清楚了
Let me get this straight!

370
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:54,899
你这死小子，你把话说明白点
Let's be clear about this, you bloody kid!

371
00:18:55,234 --> 00:18:55,893
你说什么？
What are you saying?

372
00:18:56,101 --> 00:18:57,033
阿香是你的女人
That Ah Heung's your woman

373
00:18:57,236 --> 00:18:58,168
你是阿香的男人
and you're her man?

374
00:18:58,704 --> 00:19:02,231
这还用问，你们听清楚了
Why ask? You all heard clearly.

375
00:19:02,441 --> 00:19:04,500
我问你，我是男人还是女人？
Let me ask you. Am I a man or a woman?

376
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:05,574
当然是男人啦
A man of course!

377
00:19:05,844 --> 00:19:07,106
阿香是男人还是女人？
Is Ah Heung a man or a woman?

378
00:19:07,946 --> 00:19:08,640
当然是女人了
Of course she's a woman!

379
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:09,777
这不解了吗
Then isn't it settled? Just now I said

380
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:12,576
我刚才说我是男人，阿香是女人
that I'm a man and Ah Heung's a woman.

381
00:19:12,784 --> 00:19:14,342
我还说错了，真是笨蛋
And you say I got it wrong. Idiot!

382
00:19:17,222 --> 00:19:19,417
你这个王八蛋，我非打死他不可
You son of a bitch, I'll kill you!

383
00:19:20,125 --> 00:19:20,989
你别动手
Stop it!

384
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:22,590
你别打，叫他们来
Stop it! Tell them to come!

385
00:19:23,395 --> 00:19:24,885
不能打架，不能打架
Don't fight! Don't fight!

386
00:19:25,931 --> 00:19:27,330
不要打
Don't fight! Don't fight!

387
00:19:27,533 --> 00:19:28,397
我用铁沙掌来打他
I'll use my lron Palm on him!

388
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:29,328
不要打
Don't fight!

389
00:19:29,535 --> 00:19:31,264
不要打，算了吧
Don't fight! Forget it!

390
00:19:35,107 --> 00:19:36,165
帮他打
Help him!

391
00:19:39,611 --> 00:19:41,340
铁沙掌你不怕，你看我的太极拳
Not afraid of lron Palm? Try my Tai-Chi!

392
00:19:45,384 --> 00:19:46,715
发神经
You're crazy!

393
00:19:59,831 --> 00:20:00,661
起来，起来
Get up! Get up!

394
00:20:01,433 --> 00:20:01,990
不要打
Don't fight!

395
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:05,295
好小子，你等着瞧
Damned kid! You wait and see!

396
00:20:05,504 --> 00:20:06,664
我的绝招还没有弄呢
I haven't used all my kung fu yet!

397
00:20:06,872 --> 00:20:07,930
你看我的猴拳
Try my Monkey Fist!

398
00:20:08,307 --> 00:20:10,901
算！算！别打了
Forget it! Stop fighting!

399
00:20:11,243 --> 00:20:11,937
不打     别理他们
Stop fighting! -Forget about them.

400
00:20:12,144 --> 00:20:12,473
不理他们
Forget about them.

401
00:20:12,678 --> 00:20:13,702
别理他们这帮穷鬼
Forget this bunch of penniless beggars.

402
00:20:14,012 --> 00:20:15,912
我告诉你，我这个瓷器
I'm telling you, I'm not demeaning myself

403
00:20:16,114 --> 00:20:17,103
绝不跟你们这些烂缸瓦碰
by crossing swords with you peasants!

404
00:20:17,316 --> 00:20:18,476
怎样，你怎样
What? What?

405
00:20:18,684 --> 00:20:19,582
回去吧！走
Let's go! Go!

406
00:20:19,785 --> 00:20:20,513
回去！    好
Go! - All right.

407
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:22,016
好小子，你走着瞧！
Just you wait, you damned kid!

408
00:20:22,354 --> 00:20:24,117
我下次再碰到你，我绝不饶你
You won't be so lucky the next time!

409
00:20:24,323 --> 00:20:24,982
你去哪？
Where are you going?

410
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:29,956
你没事吧？
Are you all right?

411
00:20:30,495 --> 00:20:31,723
他怎能打着我
He didn't touch me.

412
00:20:33,332 --> 00:20:34,060
你没事吧？
Are you all right?

413
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,298
没事，幸亏有你
Yes, thanks to you.

414
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:40,436
喂，你们别走，我的布料丢了
Hey, don't go! I lost a piece of fabric.

415
00:20:41,106 --> 00:20:42,334
你别管闲事，你快回去吧！
None of your business. Go!

416
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:43,007
不管怎么行
How can l?

417
00:20:43,208 --> 00:20:44,072
谁知是真是假
Who knows if it's for real or not?

418
00:20:44,643 --> 00:20:45,041
真要命！
Damn it!

419
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:45,642
阿炳！
Ah Bing!

420
00:20:45,844 --> 00:20:47,812
老婆，老婆，我们的衣料丢了
Wife, we lost a piece of fabric.

421
00:20:48,013 --> 00:20:48,741
什么时候丢的？
How did that happen?

422
00:20:48,947 --> 00:20:51,074
就是炳哥和发仔打架时丢的
It vanished during the fight.

423
00:20:51,283 --> 00:20:52,113
那怎办呢？
What do we do?

424
00:20:52,851 --> 00:20:54,443
你丢了衣料是真的还是假的？
Have you lost it for real?

425
00:20:54,653 --> 00:20:55,711
还是在胡说八道啊！
Or are you just making it up?

426
00:20:55,921 --> 00:20:56,751
当然是真的了
Of course it's for real!

427
00:20:56,955 --> 00:20:58,980
那块衣料跟这块一模一样
The fabric looks exactly like this one.

428
00:20:59,324 --> 00:21:00,916
是四婶让我做两件旗袍
It's for making two cheongsams

429
00:21:01,126 --> 00:21:02,559
给她的双胞胎穿的
for Fourth Aunt's pair of twins.

430
00:21:02,894 --> 00:21:05,124
好啦…别说了，大家别走
Say no more. Everybody stay where you are.

431
00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:07,321
现在我要一个个儿的搜
I'm searching you one by one.

432
00:21:07,532 --> 00:21:08,328
如果在谁的身上
Whoever the fabric's found on

433
00:21:08,533 --> 00:21:10,626
搜出这块衣料来
will have to compensate us all

434
00:21:10,836 --> 00:21:12,235
那我们以前丢的东西
for everything we ever lost.

435
00:21:12,437 --> 00:21:13,961
全由他一个人赔
for everything we ever lost.

436
00:21:16,041 --> 00:21:18,532
不过这样，如果搜到的话
And if the loot turns up,

437
00:21:18,744 --> 00:21:20,837
就让他烧一只猪来还神
Iet him roast a pig to thank the gods

438
00:21:21,046 --> 00:21:23,105
还得请十桌酒请大伙来喝喝
and hold a banquet for all the tenants.

439
00:21:23,815 --> 00:21:25,783
要十桌酒，那我们不搜了
That's too much. Forget it!

440
00:21:26,084 --> 00:21:26,982
算了，不要了，算了
Forget it! Forget it!

441
00:21:27,185 --> 00:21:28,049
算了，算了！
Forget it! Forget it!

442
00:21:28,253 --> 00:21:31,188
你们算了我可不能够算了
You can forget it, but I can't.

443
00:21:32,424 --> 00:21:34,722
我丢的东西实在是太多了
I've lost too much already.

444
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:37,353
如果在他身上能够搜着的话
If I find the thief,

445
00:21:37,562 --> 00:21:39,860
我就让这小子一个人赔
he will have to compensate me!

446
00:21:40,065 --> 00:21:40,963
你别这么瞎指
Don't talk nonsense.

447
00:21:42,034 --> 00:21:44,935
我问你，你丢了什么东西？
Let me ask you, what have you lost?

448
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:46,263
我丢的东西太多
Too much!

449
00:21:47,339 --> 00:21:50,365
一个金表，两条三斤重的金链
A gold watch, two 3-catty gold chains...

450
00:21:50,642 --> 00:21:53,110
三斤重？你不怕坠断你的脖子
3 catties? That woud break your neck!

451
00:21:53,512 --> 00:21:54,342
关你什么事？
What business is it of yours?

452
00:21:54,546 --> 00:21:55,979
老子的脖子能够顶得住
My neck's strong enough!

453
00:21:56,748 --> 00:21:59,683
还有四套西装，五件旗袍
Also 4 suits, 5 cheongsams,

454
00:22:00,085 --> 00:22:04,613
六双鞋，七顶帽子，八张酸枝椅
6 pairs of shoes, 7 hats,

455
00:22:04,823 --> 00:22:07,553
九长床单，还有十只金戒指
8 antique tables, 9 bedsheets, 10 gold rings,

456
00:22:07,893 --> 00:22:10,054
还有一张沙发，五个五斗柜
1 sofa, and 5 chests of drawers.

457
00:22:11,263 --> 00:22:13,493
这还算偷东西，这简直是搬家
That's no theft, it's moving house!

458
00:22:14,032 --> 00:22:15,659
你多什么嘴，关你什么事？
Shut up! It's none of your business.

459
00:22:16,034 --> 00:22:17,296
大家丢了什么东西赶快说了
Whoever's lost anything, speak up now.

460
00:22:17,602 --> 00:22:19,194
如果搜出的话大家都没好处
It's no use speaking up after we find it.

461
00:22:19,404 --> 00:22:20,393
快说，快说
Speak up, speak up.

462
00:22:21,807 --> 00:22:23,604
阿炳，这又不关我们的事
Ah Bing, stay out of it.

463
00:22:23,809 --> 00:22:25,003
我们还是回去吧！
Let's go home.

464
00:22:26,812 --> 00:22:27,801
这是条财路的
It's a good way to make money

465
00:22:28,413 --> 00:22:28,902
如果那个衣料
If I find the fabric on that damned kid,

466
00:22:29,114 --> 00:22:30,308
在那小子身上搜出的话
If I find the fabric on that damned kid,

467
00:22:30,515 --> 00:22:32,949
什么棺材本，什么什么都有了吗
I can afford everything plus my coffin!

468
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:35,113
你随便说几样都可以
Just name a few things you've lost.

469
00:22:35,587 --> 00:22:37,521
对了，八姑说她丢东西了
That's right, Pat Koo lost some things too.

470
00:22:37,723 --> 00:22:38,246
你丢了什么了？
What did you lose?

471
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:40,023
没有     没有
Nothing. - Nothing?

472
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:42,384
五筒没有
Co...coal, 5 buckets of coal

473
00:22:42,661 --> 00:22:43,593
你真是要我的命
Upon my life!

474
00:22:43,795 --> 00:22:44,386
还有什么？
What else?

475
00:22:44,596 --> 00:22:45,927
五只金戒指
Five gold rings.

476
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:48,026
这个王八蛋     阿福
You bastard. - Ah Fook.

477
00:22:48,934 --> 00:22:49,696
阿炳
Ah Bing,

478
00:22:50,302 --> 00:22:50,961
我看是找不到了
I don't think you'll find anything.

479
00:22:51,169 --> 00:22:52,261
我们还是回去吧！
Let's go home.

480
00:22:52,637 --> 00:22:53,433
怎么会找不到呢？
What makes you think we won't find anything?

481
00:22:54,339 --> 00:22:55,237
大伙都听着了
Listen everyone.

482
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,499
那块布料就是这个颜色的
The fabirc is exactly this colour.

483
00:22:58,810 --> 00:22:59,572
我搜给你们看
I'll conduct the search.

484
00:23:00,979 --> 00:23:02,844
你蟑头鼠目的，先搜你   别动
You look suspicious. You first. -Hold it!

485
00:23:04,383 --> 00:23:05,281
你搜我谁去搜你
You search me, who searches you?

486
00:23:06,418 --> 00:23:08,215
我还用搜，我像贼吗？
Nobody. Do I look like a thief?

487
00:23:08,787 --> 00:23:10,379
那块布料会在我身上搜到？
You think you'll find the fabric on me?

488
00:23:10,589 --> 00:23:11,419
你神经病的
You're crazy!

489
00:23:11,623 --> 00:23:12,749
谁知道你像不像贼
Who can tell if you're a thief or not?

490
00:23:12,958 --> 00:23:14,050
要搜大家一块儿搜
If there's a search, we all do it!

491
00:23:14,459 --> 00:23:15,585
好，大家搜
OK, let's all search!

492
00:23:15,794 --> 00:23:16,726
搜不出来有你好看的
But if nothing turns up, you'll be sorry.

493
00:23:18,196 --> 00:23:18,787
搜啊！
Let's search!

494
00:23:19,531 --> 00:23:20,520
你干什么？
What are you doing?

495
00:23:20,732 --> 00:23:21,289
我要搜他
I'm searching him.

496
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:22,364
炳啊，你跟他们讲话什么
Ah Ping, what are you talking with them for?

497
00:23:22,567 --> 00:23:24,592
你又不会偷东西呢，走走，回去
You'd never steal. Let's go.

498
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:28,268
走开，男人大丈夫说得到做得到
Away! I'm a man of my word.

499
00:23:28,573 --> 00:23:29,904
我又不是贼，我怕什么呀！
I'm no thief. I have nothing to fear.

500
00:23:30,108 --> 00:23:31,006
是，搜，搜
Yes, search!

501
00:23:31,209 --> 00:23:32,073
搜，搜
Search! Search!

502
00:23:32,277 --> 00:23:33,403
你搜呀你！
You go search!

503
00:23:33,945 --> 00:23:37,711
我自己搜，没有啊
I'll search myself! There's nothing.

504
00:23:39,518 --> 00:23:40,212
没有
Nothing.

505
00:23:41,119 --> 00:23:42,518
这个不会有
Won't be anything here.

506
00:23:47,859 --> 00:23:49,451
原来他就是贼
So he's the thief!

507
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:53,865
还神摆酒…
Thank the gods! Hold a banquet!

508
00:23:54,065 --> 00:23:55,430
这真是自找倒霉
You brought this on yourself.

509
00:23:57,769 --> 00:23:59,202
老陈，你偷偷的嫁祸于我
Old Chan, you framed me!

510
00:23:59,404 --> 00:24:00,268
把衣料放在我口袋里
You slipped it into my pocket!

511
00:24:01,773 --> 00:24:02,398
阿福
Ah Fook!

512
00:24:03,041 --> 00:24:03,769
你害我是不是？
You framed me, didn't you?

513
00:24:04,342 --> 00:24:05,809
我说不是我啊！
I tell you it's not me!

514
00:24:06,011 --> 00:24:06,238
还说不是你
You still deny it?

515
00:24:06,445 --> 00:24:08,379
太子炳，你别冤枉好人
Master Bing, don't accuse an innocent person!

516
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:08,807
阿福
Ah Fook.

517
00:24:09,014 --> 00:24:09,639
刚才打架的时候
During the fight just now,

518
00:24:09,848 --> 00:24:11,440
我亲眼看见有人把这块衣料
I saw someone slip it into your pocket,

519
00:24:11,650 --> 00:24:12,446
放在你口袋里的
I saw someone slip it into your pocket,

520
00:24:12,651 --> 00:24:14,084
不过不是陈伯
but it wasn't Uncle Chan.

521
00:24:14,853 --> 00:24:15,581
你亲眼看见
You saw someone put it in my pocket?

522
00:24:15,787 --> 00:24:16,981
有人把衣料放在我口袋里
You saw someone put it in my pocket?

523
00:24:18,056 --> 00:24:21,287
阿福，我早就说过你很够聪明
Ah Fook, didn't I always say you were smart?

524
00:24:21,493 --> 00:24:22,585
你是个好人
You're a decent person.

525
00:24:23,361 --> 00:24:24,487
大伙都听清楚了没有
Did you all hear what he said?

526
00:24:24,896 --> 00:24:26,227
有人看见他把衣料
Someone saw him slip the fabric

527
00:24:26,431 --> 00:24:28,023
偷偷的放在我口袋里去的
into my pocket.

528
00:24:29,134 --> 00:24:31,261
阿福，你看是哪个绝子绝孙的
Ah Fook, tell me which son of a bitch

529
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:33,199
把衣料放在我口袋里去的
planted the fabric in my pocket?

530
00:24:33,538 --> 00:24:36,803
我要拧断他脖子，砸烂他的狗头
I'll wring his neck and bash his head!

531
00:24:37,108 --> 00:24:38,939
活生生捏死他
I'll strangle him alive!

532
00:24:40,111 --> 00:24:40,770
阿福哥
Brother Fook,

533
00:24:40,979 --> 00:24:42,241
前两天我把你的电线给剪了
I cut your electricity a few days ago,

534
00:24:42,447 --> 00:24:43,141
你一定很不方便
It must be such an inconvenience.

535
00:24:43,348 --> 00:24:45,043
明天，我马上给你接好
I'll reconnect it first thing tomorrow.

536
00:24:46,084 --> 00:24:46,812
这么好心？
How kind!

537
00:24:48,053 --> 00:24:49,782
你当然明白我的意思了
Of course, you get my meaning.

538
00:24:49,988 --> 00:24:50,818
我知道
Of course I get it.

539
00:24:51,890 --> 00:24:53,824
炳哥，我现在不知道是谁了
Brother Bing, I can't tell now who it was.

540
00:24:54,693 --> 00:24:55,352
你这是什么意思
What do you mean, you can't tell?

541
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:55,958
你不说出来
What do you mean, you cant tell?

542
00:24:56,161 --> 00:24:57,423
我怎么去拧断他的脖子
How would I know whose neck to break?

543
00:24:57,963 --> 00:24:58,622
你叫我说呀
You want me to tell?

544
00:24:59,698 --> 00:25:02,223
不要说呀，你千万不要说是我
Don't! Don't tell him it's me!

545
00:25:02,434 --> 00:25:03,264
你又不要我说呀？
And you don't want me to tell?

546
00:25:03,902 --> 00:25:04,527
这就不对了，福哥
That's not right, Brother Fook.

547
00:25:04,736 --> 00:25:05,634
你知道就该说出来
If you know, you should speak up,

548
00:25:05,837 --> 00:25:06,804
大家好落个清白
so the rest of us are in the clear.

549
00:25:07,005 --> 00:25:09,337
对了！
That's right!

550
00:25:09,541 --> 00:25:10,599
还是说了好
I suppose I'd better tell.

551
00:25:11,343 --> 00:25:12,105
我说了
It's her!

552
00:25:19,284 --> 00:25:20,911
白杬福，你诚心要我塌台
Olive Peddler, you're deliberately doing this!

553
00:25:21,119 --> 00:25:22,609
好，我叫三六九来对付你
OK! I'll have Constable 369 sort you out!

554
00:25:25,123 --> 00:25:27,318
老板，给我来碗烧鹅米粉
Rice noodles with roast goose,

555
00:25:27,526 --> 00:25:28,322
要大碗的
a big bowl of it,

556
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:30,218
一瓶白干，巷子里
and a bottle, in the alley.

557
00:25:43,008 --> 00:25:43,633
敬礼！
Salute!

558
00:25:44,576 --> 00:25:45,770
干什么？是我啊！
What are you doing? It's me!

559
00:25:46,611 --> 00:25:49,045
太子炳，你别吓唬我好不好
Master Bing, don't scare me!

560
00:25:49,247 --> 00:25:50,771
人吓人能吓死人呀
You could scare someone to death!

561
00:25:52,584 --> 00:25:54,176
我吃东西是偷偷摸摸的
I have to hide in order to eat.

562
00:25:57,389 --> 00:25:58,720
怎么样？不要钱的
How's this? It's free.

563
00:25:59,524 --> 00:26:01,219
不要钱？那我也来一份
Free? In that case I'll have some.

564
00:26:01,426 --> 00:26:02,154
好
Excellent!

565
00:26:04,462 --> 00:26:07,954
老板，照样来一份啊！
The same again.

566
00:26:09,534 --> 00:26:12,002
太子炳啊！你一定有事来找我
Something you need help with, Master Bing?

567
00:26:12,771 --> 00:26:14,102
大的事可别来麻烦我
If it's serious, I don't want to know!

568
00:26:14,406 --> 00:26:17,864
知道了，三六九明天你要给我
Understood. 369, tomorrow I want you

569
00:26:18,076 --> 00:26:20,340
对付那个小贩白杬福
to sort out that olive peddler for me.

570
00:26:21,112 --> 00:26:22,306
你要一包
You want a packet.

571
00:26:23,882 --> 00:26:25,042
谢谢
Thanks.

572
00:26:25,417 --> 00:26:26,384
给我二包
Give me two.

573
00:26:26,585 --> 00:26:29,281
楼上也要
Upstairs.

574
00:26:31,156 --> 00:26:32,919
钱呐      谢谢
Money's inside. - Thanks.

575
00:26:34,726 --> 00:26:35,556
你也要
You want some?

576
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:36,624
来
Come.

577
00:26:38,997 --> 00:26:41,932
福哥，我也来买，我要三包
Me too, Brother Fook. I'll have 3 packets.

578
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,492
要几包？
How many?

579
00:26:43,702 --> 00:26:44,600
三包呀
Three packets!

580
00:26:47,906 --> 00:26:48,930
谢谢！     谢谢你呀！
Thanks! - Thanks you!

581
00:26:49,307 --> 00:26:50,103
福哥！
Brother Fook!

582
00:26:50,308 --> 00:26:51,570
来，来，来
Come, come!

583
00:26:52,544 --> 00:26:53,841
你也要！
You want some too?

584
00:26:54,746 --> 00:26:57,214
先生啊！过来叫船吧！来呀！
Mister, come ride in my sampan.

585
00:27:00,185 --> 00:27:01,049
那老总，叫船吗？
Hey Boss, you want a ride?

586
00:27:01,252 --> 00:27:01,980
初四啊！
Hey, Fourth!

587
00:27:02,287 --> 00:27:02,946
什么事，十五？
What is it, Fifteenth?

588
00:27:03,154 --> 00:27:04,553
你那个米店老板来了
Your rice shop sugar daddy's coming.

589
00:27:05,523 --> 00:27:06,251
初四
Fourth.

590
00:27:07,158 --> 00:27:09,058
怎么这么早，程老板
How come you're so early, Boss Ching?

591
00:27:09,461 --> 00:27:10,052
怎么敢迟
I dare not be late! Any later,

592
00:27:10,261 --> 00:27:12,525
再迟你的船给人租走了
and someone else might have hired your boat.

593
00:27:13,164 --> 00:27:15,655
别这样，昨晚我让你给气死了
Don't. You really annoyed me last night.

594
00:27:15,967 --> 00:27:16,524
你给我的船钱
What? -The boat money you gave me.

595
00:27:16,735 --> 00:27:18,794
我今天去换大头，亏了一半
I changed it today, and it's only worth half.

596
00:27:19,938 --> 00:27:20,836
这回你放心
Relax.

597
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:23,473
今天我租船不给钱
I'm not paying you with money today.

598
00:27:24,142 --> 00:27:25,109
那你给我什么？
Then what are you paying me with?

599
00:27:32,817 --> 00:27:33,579
一担米
1 00 catties of rice.

600
00:27:34,619 --> 00:27:36,644
这倒不错，下船吧！混球
Good idea! Come on in, hot shot.

601
00:27:37,188 --> 00:27:38,212
你才混！      讨厌！
You're the one who's hot! -Disgusting!

602
00:27:38,890 --> 00:27:39,982
来
Come.

603
00:27:40,291 --> 00:27:42,691
十五啊！    什么事？
Fifteenth! -What is it?

604
00:27:43,128 --> 00:27:44,720
先拿这些现钞去换大头吧！
Take this cash and change it to HK dollars.

605
00:27:48,233 --> 00:27:49,723
这儿四十万，刚好四块！
There's 400 grand here: 4 bucks, exactly!

606
00:27:52,037 --> 00:27:52,935
你是不是弄错了
What? Are you sure?

607
00:27:53,138 --> 00:27:55,663
刚才那人给你大头就一块九万
That guy was paying 1 dollar to 90 grand.

608
00:27:55,874 --> 00:27:58,104
我现在给你现钞就十万换一块
Now I'm giving you 100 grand cash to a buck.

609
00:27:58,309 --> 00:27:59,401
这不差了一万块
Here's 10 thousand exactly.

610
00:27:59,844 --> 00:28:01,869
就是这样了
That's how it is.

611
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:03,342
要不是左刮一点，右刮一点
You scrape a bit from left and right.

612
00:28:03,548 --> 00:28:04,742
怎么能赚很多钱呢？
How else do you make money?

613
00:28:05,083 --> 00:28:05,777
不过叔叔
But uncle,

614
00:28:05,984 --> 00:28:07,815
我爹以前和你是结拜兄弟
my dad used to say you were blood brothers.

615
00:28:09,554 --> 00:28:12,079
我告诉你吧，就算你是我爹
Let me tell you, even if it's my own father,

616
00:28:12,290 --> 00:28:13,188
也要这么刮的
I'd be scraping all the same!

617
00:28:13,958 --> 00:28:15,323
这件事情你别急呀
There's no use getting upset over this.

618
00:28:15,527 --> 00:28:17,495
让我告诉你呀，谈到钱
I tell you, when it comes to money,

619
00:28:17,696 --> 00:28:20,028
爹跟儿子也没得商量的
not even fathers and sons make a difference.

620
00:28:21,132 --> 00:28:22,064
四块钱！
Four dollars!

621
00:28:31,209 --> 00:28:34,610
抢劫啊！抢劫啊！
Thief! Thief!

622
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:38,042
有贼…巡警呀，有贼，跑了
Constable, there's a thief! He's run off!

623
00:28:38,249 --> 00:28:39,147
有贼，没看见呀！
Thief? Where?

624
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:41,750
在那边     在哪边？好
There! -There? OK!

625
00:28:43,822 --> 00:28:45,084
在那边儿啊！
No! He went that way!

626
00:28:45,290 --> 00:28:46,382
你们几个丫头是不是疯了？
Are you crazy or what?

627
00:28:46,591 --> 00:28:47,751
我是抓贼的吗？
Do I look like I chase thieves?

628
00:28:48,693 --> 00:28:51,127
你不抓贼？
You don't?

629
00:28:52,530 --> 00:28:54,691
卖橄榄的小子，你别走 三六九
You! Olive peddler! Halt! -369

630
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:58,931
我问你，刚才有人喊抢东西
369, I heard someone shout "thief".

631
00:28:59,137 --> 00:28:59,967
你什么不去追贼？
Why aren't you chasing the thief?

632
00:29:00,672 --> 00:29:03,470
玩命啊！我没听见，你去追吧
And risk my life? I didn't hear it. You go.

633
00:29:04,576 --> 00:29:05,338
真是败类
How pathetic!

634
00:29:05,844 --> 00:29:07,471
小姐，贼跑什么地方去了？
Miss, which way did the thief go?

635
00:29:07,979 --> 00:29:09,503
他往那边去了     谢谢你
He went that way. -Thanks!

636
00:29:12,050 --> 00:29:13,347
这个不错
This one's not bad.

637
00:29:13,651 --> 00:29:14,675
警察有两种的！
Seems there're two kinds of policemen!

638
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:16,952
你是不是叫白杬福
Are you Fook, the olive peddler?

639
00:29:17,155 --> 00:29:18,417
是的，我就是
Yes, I am.

640
00:29:19,924 --> 00:29:22,415
进去，进去，走！
Inside. Move!

641
00:29:22,761 --> 00:29:23,819
老兄，有什么事啊？
What's the matter, brother?

642
00:29:24,562 --> 00:29:25,187
查牌
Licence check.

643
00:29:26,331 --> 00:29:28,094
我这种流动营业的小生意
Where would a mobile small business like mine

644
00:29:28,299 --> 00:29:29,129
那里有什么牌？
get any sort of licence?

645
00:29:29,434 --> 00:29:30,731
凡是做生意的都要领牌
Every kind of business needs a licence.

646
00:29:31,102 --> 00:29:31,796
为什么你不领
Why didn't you apply for one?

647
00:29:32,303 --> 00:29:35,363
老兄，去领牌比要饭还要惨
Applying for a licence is worse than begging.

648
00:29:35,573 --> 00:29:38,133
你们弟兄办事比蜗牛还慢
Your colleagues work slower than snails!

649
00:29:38,443 --> 00:29:40,172
谁说的，你欠税试试看
Says who? You try dodging taxes,

650
00:29:40,378 --> 00:29:42,209
追得你命都没有了，废话少说
then you'd know how fast they work.

651
00:29:42,413 --> 00:29:43,141
跟我到警察局去
You're coming with me to the station.

652
00:29:43,848 --> 00:29:45,338
有事情慢慢商量
Wait! Let's talk this over.

653
00:29:46,184 --> 00:29:48,049
有商量，行！
OK, let's talk.

654
00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:53,514
干嘛，看手相我不懂
What's this? I'm not a palm reader

655
00:29:53,992 --> 00:29:55,960
看什么手相，是五斗米
It isn't palm reading, it's 5 pecks of rice.

656
00:29:56,694 --> 00:29:58,184
五斗米，你给我
5 pecks? You're giving it to me?

657
00:29:58,496 --> 00:29:59,428
怎么，没有呀？
Well? Do you have it or not?

658
00:29:59,697 --> 00:30:00,493
当然没有啦
Of course not!

659
00:30:01,332 --> 00:30:01,798
这样好了
How about this?

660
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,160
夏季大减价，三斗吧！
A summer discount: 3 pecks!

661
00:30:03,835 --> 00:30:04,802
也没有
I don't have that much either.

662
00:30:05,003 --> 00:30:05,662
又没有
You don't?

663
00:30:06,704 --> 00:30:07,693
我看这样好了
Then this is what we'll do.

664
00:30:07,906 --> 00:30:10,204
你就给我三块大头也行！
You can give me 3 HK dollars.

665
00:30:10,408 --> 00:30:12,603
三块大头，你给我差不多
3 HK dollars! You must be kidding!

666
00:30:14,379 --> 00:30:15,869
想不到你比我还要坏呀！
I didn't know you worse off than me!

667
00:30:16,247 --> 00:30:18,215
那干干脆脆一块大头就行了
All right, let's settle it for a dollar.

668
00:30:19,083 --> 00:30:19,845
想抢呀！
That's robbery!

669
00:30:20,218 --> 00:30:21,276
我辛辛苦苦赚来的钱
It's hard-earned money!

670
00:30:21,486 --> 00:30:23,420
还要养老婆儿女的
I've a wife and a kid to support!

671
00:30:25,123 --> 00:30:26,021
你少啰嗦
Quit complaining!

672
00:30:26,224 --> 00:30:27,987
有钱大家花，有福大家享
Money's meant to be shared.

673
00:30:28,293 --> 00:30:30,022
你要是不给钱，我就抓你去坐牢
Pay up, or I lock you up.

674
00:30:33,331 --> 00:30:35,731
他妈的，简直是打劫
Dammit! This is outight robbery!

675
00:30:38,303 --> 00:30:39,099
福哥
Brother Fook.

676
00:30:40,471 --> 00:30:40,994
什么事？
What's the matter?

677
00:30:41,472 --> 00:30:42,234
你回来了
You're back!

678
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:43,429
小福病得很厉害
Your son's very ill!

679
00:30:43,641 --> 00:30:44,573
你快去看看吧！
Go see him, quick!

680
00:30:47,378 --> 00:30:48,538
福哥，小福发烧得很厉害
Ah Fook, Little Fook has a high fever.

681
00:30:48,746 --> 00:30:50,043
金医生说他是急性肺炎
Dr Kim says it's acute pneumonia!

682
00:30:50,248 --> 00:30:51,442
金医生说要马上送医院
He said we must take him to the hospital.

683
00:30:51,649 --> 00:30:52,638
现在去问住院手续去了
He's gone to make the arrangements.

684
00:30:52,851 --> 00:30:54,478
我老婆呢？     去借钱去了
Where's my wife? -Gone to borrow money.

685
00:31:00,825 --> 00:31:01,792
别动，别动
Don't move. Don't move.

686
00:31:03,561 --> 00:31:04,721
别动
Don't move. Don't move.

687
00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:07,320
这可是真货，三个大头
The real McCoy, 3 HK dollars!

688
00:31:08,299 --> 00:31:09,493
下次多带点
Bring more next time.

689
00:31:09,701 --> 00:31:10,599
走啦！
Go!

690
00:31:11,669 --> 00:31:13,000
有贼！
Thief!

691
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:17,239
这个小流氓真的该死
Those god damned thugs!

692
00:31:17,442 --> 00:31:19,171
人家看病的钱也抢走
Stealing people's medical fees!

693
00:31:19,711 --> 00:31:20,939
市面不好，才会有贼
It's the economy. People turn to crime.

694
00:31:22,647 --> 00:31:23,944
陈伯，那我们怎么办呢？
Uncle Chan, what shall we do?

695
00:31:24,349 --> 00:31:26,340
怎么样…借到钱没有？
Did you manage to borrow money?

696
00:31:26,684 --> 00:31:28,709
我问过了，住医院要三个大头
I asked. The hospital fee is $3.

697
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:31,350
三个大头
Three dollars!

698
00:31:31,556 --> 00:31:33,888
金医生，她借来的钱给人抢走了
Dr Kim, she's just been robbed!

699
00:31:34,259 --> 00:31:37,092
那怎么办，不进医院要死的
He'll die if he doesn't go to the hospital!

700
00:31:50,675 --> 00:31:51,369
妈
Ma...

701
00:31:51,576 --> 00:31:54,704
孩子，你明知爸爸妈妈没钱
Son, you know we don't have money.

702
00:31:54,913 --> 00:31:56,540
为什么要病呀！
Why did you have to fall sick?

703
00:32:00,251 --> 00:32:01,411
事情也太不巧了
It's such an unlucky coincidence!

704
00:32:01,619 --> 00:32:03,348
我把钱都买了肥皂了
I spent all my money on soap.

705
00:32:04,222 --> 00:32:06,520
我也是，钱都买了面粉
Me too. I spent mine on flour.

706
00:32:06,724 --> 00:32:07,884
要不然…
Otherwise...

707
00:32:13,965 --> 00:32:15,489
妈
Ma...

708
00:32:18,603 --> 00:32:20,662
福哥，我这儿一块大头
Brother Fook, here's a dollar.

709
00:32:20,872 --> 00:32:22,134
你先拿去吧，我不买被子了
Take it. I'm not buying a blanket.

710
00:32:22,707 --> 00:32:24,299
我今天刚刚赚了一个大头
I just made a dollar today.

711
00:32:24,509 --> 00:32:25,305
你先拿去吧！
You take it first.

712
00:32:26,377 --> 00:32:29,141
现在还差一块钱，谁有，谁还有
We're still a dollar short. Who has it?

713
00:32:34,419 --> 00:32:38,048
福哥，这个大头是我老婆的嫁妆
Ah Fook, this dollar is my wife's dowry.

714
00:32:38,556 --> 00:32:40,421
本来是准备留给我女儿的
I was keeping it for my daughter,

715
00:32:41,225 --> 00:32:43,193
可惜女儿打仗时候被炸死了
but she was killed in the war.

716
00:32:44,295 --> 00:32:45,227
现在没有用了
I've no use for it now.

717
00:32:45,430 --> 00:32:46,658
你拿去给孩子看病吧！
Use it for your son's treatment.

718
00:32:49,767 --> 00:32:51,234
多谢陈伯
Thank you, Uncle Chan.

719
00:32:51,436 --> 00:32:53,131
好了，好了，别多说了
All right, all right, no more words.

720
00:32:53,338 --> 00:32:54,600
赶快进医院，走
Let's get him to the hospital.

721
00:32:54,973 --> 00:32:59,376
让我来，来，乖！
I'm coming. Come on. Good boy.

722
00:33:00,211 --> 00:33:01,075
小心点
Careful.

723
00:33:01,412 --> 00:33:02,504
快，快！
Quick, quick!

724
00:33:03,448 --> 00:33:04,813
快点吧！
Hurry up!

725
00:33:10,855 --> 00:33:13,653
这年头，没钱千万别生病啊！
Nowadays, you can't get sick if you're poor.

726
00:33:13,992 --> 00:33:16,790
就是嘛，我先下去看看煮的粥了
How true! I'll see if the congee's ready.

727
00:33:18,296 --> 00:33:19,456
我们也该去洗衣服了
We should go wash some clothes.

728
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:24,425
发仔哥，你的衣服怎么破了
Fat Chai, why is your jacket torn?

729
00:33:26,404 --> 00:33:26,699
一定是刚才
It must have got ripped just now

730
00:33:26,904 --> 00:33:28,064
又忙又乱的时候勾破的
in all the commotion.

731
00:33:28,439 --> 00:33:29,770
趁我妈还没回来，快点脱下来
My mum's not back yet. Take it off

732
00:33:29,974 --> 00:33:30,906
我给你补一补吧！
and I'll mend it for you.

733
00:33:31,642 --> 00:33:32,404
谢谢你
Thank you.

734
00:33:37,548 --> 00:33:38,480
拿来吧！     谢谢！
Give it to me. -Thank you!

735
00:33:43,621 --> 00:33:45,350
对了，我搬来没几天
I've only been here a few days

736
00:33:45,556 --> 00:33:46,318
整天看你挨打
but I see your mother beat you all the time.

737
00:33:46,524 --> 00:33:47,320
你妈怎么那么凶啊！
Why is she so cruel?

738
00:33:48,426 --> 00:33:49,791
我不是她亲生的
I'm not her real daughter.

739
00:33:50,628 --> 00:33:53,654
我九岁的时候，她就把我买过来
She bought me when I was 9 years old.

740
00:33:54,032 --> 00:33:54,862
怪不得！
No wonder!

741
00:33:55,433 --> 00:33:56,798
我跟你差不多
I'm a bit like you.

742
00:33:57,001 --> 00:33:58,366
我从小就没了父母了
I also lost my parents when I was little.

743
00:34:01,105 --> 00:34:01,969
发仔哥
Fat Chai,

744
00:34:02,173 --> 00:34:03,800
你是不是读过很多的书啊？
have you studied a lot?

745
00:34:04,108 --> 00:34:05,166
那有钱读书
Who has the money to go to school?

746
00:34:05,376 --> 00:34:06,843
我十二岁就学补鞋了
I started mending shoes when I was 1 2.

747
00:34:07,178 --> 00:34:09,146
那么你怎么那么能干？
Then how come you're so capable?

748
00:34:09,347 --> 00:34:10,109
什么能干？
Capable? How so?

749
00:34:10,515 --> 00:34:12,642
比如你敢跟太子炳作对
Like when you opposed Master Bing,

750
00:34:12,850 --> 00:34:15,114
又肯帮助同屋住户
and the way you help your neighbors.

751
00:34:15,319 --> 00:34:16,650
我不知该怎么说
I don't know how to say it,

752
00:34:16,854 --> 00:34:19,152
总而言之，你实在太好了
but well, you're just too good.

753
00:34:19,357 --> 00:34:20,381
其实也没什么
There's nothing on it, really.

754
00:34:20,591 --> 00:34:22,354
一个人只要走正路
As long as a man walks a straight path

755
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:25,120
吃点亏也不在乎的话，准没错
and doesn't mind taking a few knocks,

756
00:34:26,464 --> 00:34:28,091
这不就是能干吗？
he can't go wrong. Is that capable?

757
00:34:28,299 --> 00:34:30,460
不，你会补衣服，我就不会
No. You can mend clothes and I can't,

758
00:34:30,668 --> 00:34:31,464
你不比我能干？
so you're more capable than I am!

759
00:34:32,770 --> 00:34:33,634
我不跟你说了
I'm not talking to you anymore.

760
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:39,476
发仔，发仔呀！
Fat Chai! Fat Chai!

761
00:34:39,677 --> 00:34:40,439
我在这儿
I'm up here!

762
00:34:41,813 --> 00:34:43,041
你怎么跑那儿去？
What are you doing up there?

763
00:34:43,414 --> 00:34:44,847
阿香在给我补衣服
Ah Heung's mending my jacket.

764
00:34:46,017 --> 00:34:47,245
补好了     谢谢你
All done. -Thank you!

765
00:34:47,452 --> 00:34:49,579
来，你先吃这碗粥吧！
Come have some congee.

766
00:34:51,522 --> 00:34:52,955
阿香在这儿正好
Ah Heung, you're here too. Good.

767
00:34:53,791 --> 00:34:56,385
我知道八姑不回来是不许煮饭的
I know you can't eat until Pat Koo's back,

768
00:34:56,894 --> 00:34:58,225
我想你肚子一定很饿的
so you must be very hungry.

769
00:34:58,429 --> 00:34:59,396
你先吃碗粥吧！
Here, have some congee first.

770
00:35:00,865 --> 00:35:02,856
不要了，你们两个吃吧！
No thanks. You two have it.

771
00:35:05,103 --> 00:35:06,229
我们一人少吃一口
We'll just each have a little less.

772
00:35:06,437 --> 00:35:08,769
阿香，阿香，真他妈倒霉
Ah Heung! Ah Heung! What rotten luck!

773
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:10,707
八圈牌输了十六底
I lost 16 games in 8 rounds of mahjong.

774
00:35:11,375 --> 00:35:15,641
阿香，开门      来了
Ah Heung, open the door. -Coming!

775
00:35:17,882 --> 00:35:18,849
倒茶
Pour me some tea.

776
00:35:24,388 --> 00:35:25,514
真倒霉
Dammit! What rotten luck!

777
00:35:28,993 --> 00:35:29,823
妈
Ma.

778
00:35:31,195 --> 00:35:32,992
你看你这死相
Look at your damned face!

779
00:35:33,831 --> 00:35:35,264
我看你就有气
It makes me angry just looking at you.

780
00:35:35,566 --> 00:35:36,590
都是你呀
It's all your fault!

781
00:35:37,668 --> 00:35:39,602
跑到那处，叫我一声妈
Calling me Ma everywhere.

782
00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:41,431
害我八圈牌输了十六底
Making me lse 16 games in 8 rounds!

783
00:35:45,243 --> 00:35:46,107
站着干什么？
What are you standing there for?

784
00:35:46,477 --> 00:35:47,967
你明知我打牌累
You know very well I've been playing mahjong.

785
00:35:48,179 --> 00:35:49,305
还不跟我捶捶
Give a massage already!

786
00:35:54,352 --> 00:35:55,444
用点力行不行？
Put a little strength into it.

787
00:35:55,653 --> 00:35:56,347
你没吃饭哪！
Haven't you eaten?

788
00:35:57,922 --> 00:35:58,980
我是没吃饭啊！
No, I haven't.

789
00:35:59,657 --> 00:36:01,056
早上不是有半碗冷饭吗？
Wasn't there half a bowl of leftovers?

790
00:36:02,293 --> 00:36:04,591
只有半碗冷饭，我吃了还不够饱
Half a bowl wasn't filing enough.

791
00:36:05,029 --> 00:36:06,053
你去死了吧！
Damn you!

792
00:36:08,266 --> 00:36:10,564
你疯了，你吃那么多
Have you gone crazy?

793
00:36:10,768 --> 00:36:11,792
你想把我吃穷了
You want to eat me out of house and home?

794
00:36:12,570 --> 00:36:14,595
楼上静点行不行啊！
Can you keep quiet upstairs?

795
00:36:15,306 --> 00:36:17,240
你想清静
If you want peace and quiet,

796
00:36:17,642 --> 00:36:19,132
想清静有地方
there's a perfect place for it:

797
00:36:19,877 --> 00:36:21,811
你为什么不搬到殡仪馆去住！
why don't you go live in a mortuary?

798
00:36:23,981 --> 00:36:26,541
好多沙子啊，我们在喝粥呢
You're making dust fall. We're having congee!

799
00:36:27,552 --> 00:36:29,019
喝粥有什么了不起
You're having congee? So what?

800
00:36:29,353 --> 00:36:31,787
要是你们吃全席的话那还得了
It's not as if you're having a full banquet!

801
00:36:32,223 --> 00:36:35,317
我要理     八婆！
Answer me! -Bitch!

802
00:36:36,827 --> 00:36:38,761
老虎不发威把我当病猫？
What makes you think you can pick on me?

803
00:36:40,598 --> 00:36:41,963
我愿意，我高兴
I just happen to like it noisy.

804
00:36:42,934 --> 00:36:45,095
发仔，你干什么？
Fat Chai, what are you doing?

805
00:36:45,803 --> 00:36:46,963
你干什么？
What are you doing?

806
00:36:48,105 --> 00:36:49,299
你要拆房子啊
You want to tear the house down?

807
00:36:49,607 --> 00:36:50,164
发仔
Fat Chai!

808
00:36:50,374 --> 00:36:51,272
杨伯别管我
Let me be, Uncle Yeung.

809
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:54,804
救命呀！有人要拆房子啊
Help! Someone's tearing down the house!

810
00:36:57,615 --> 00:36:58,775
你个死小子
You damned kid!

811
00:36:58,983 --> 00:36:59,813
发仔
Fat Chai!

812
00:37:00,017 --> 00:37:00,381
你以为我怕你呀
You think I'm scared of you?

813
00:37:00,585 --> 00:37:02,519
我怕你是不是
You think I'm scared, is that it?

814
00:37:04,422 --> 00:37:05,354
发仔
Fat Chai!

815
00:37:05,556 --> 00:37:06,454
我看你把我怎么样？
What are you going to do?

816
00:37:07,858 --> 00:37:08,984
你怎么打人呀？
Why are you hitting people?

817
00:37:10,294 --> 00:37:11,158
杨伯，拿把刀来
Uncle Yeung, hand me a knife.

818
00:37:11,362 --> 00:37:13,091
剁来做白云猪蹄子
I'll cut me some pig's trotters!

819
00:37:14,498 --> 00:37:16,022
发仔
Fat Chai!

820
00:37:16,701 --> 00:37:17,190
你骂够了没有
You dare insult me!

821
00:37:17,401 --> 00:37:18,959
对不起，对不起
Sorry, sorry!

822
00:37:20,404 --> 00:37:22,338
你这个死小子，我跟你拼了
You damned kid, I'll show you!

823
00:37:25,209 --> 00:37:26,471
杨伯，别拉我
Let's see what she'll do.

824
00:37:26,877 --> 00:37:28,003
什么事这么吵？
What's all this racket?

825
00:37:28,546 --> 00:37:29,740
你回来得正好
You've come back just in time.

826
00:37:29,947 --> 00:37:32,313
刚才那死小子想拆我们的楼
That bloody kid tried to tear the house down.

827
00:37:32,516 --> 00:37:33,380
弄坏了楼板
Smashed up the floorboards.

828
00:37:33,851 --> 00:37:34,476
在哪儿？
Where?

829
00:37:35,419 --> 00:37:36,511
就在这儿
Right here.

830
00:37:38,356 --> 00:37:41,519
我的肚子，刚才那个王八蛋
It hurts! Just now that bastard

831
00:37:41,726 --> 00:37:43,956
把我气得上气不接下气
made me so mad I couldn't breathe.

832
00:37:44,161 --> 00:37:47,653
堵住了中气，痛死我了！
Now my chest hurts! Oh, the agony!

833
00:37:48,232 --> 00:37:50,393
老八，你不要生气了
Don't be so angry.

834
00:37:50,601 --> 00:37:52,626
有气你留给我受
Just leave it to me.

835
00:37:53,070 --> 00:37:54,731
你自己何必这么辛苦呢？
Why trouble yourself so?

836
00:37:55,606 --> 00:37:57,574
要不然到隔壁弄两口抽抽
Go next door and have a smoke.

837
00:37:57,775 --> 00:37:59,902
顺顺气好不好，我亲爱的老八
Calm yourself down, my dear.

838
00:38:01,279 --> 00:38:02,211
你说得对
You're right.

839
00:38:02,647 --> 00:38:04,945
死丫头，把钱包拿过来
Get me the purse, you damned girl!

840
00:38:05,149 --> 00:38:06,173
快点，快点
Hurry up! Hurry up!

841
00:38:09,186 --> 00:38:10,517
快点，快点     妈
Hurry up! Hurry up! -Yes, Ma.

842
00:38:11,489 --> 00:38:12,751
可怜了
Poor thing.

843
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:18,922
你这个色鬼，等我回来再睡
Wait for me, you sex fiend!

844
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:20,119
知道了，老佛爷
Yes, Your Majesty.

845
00:38:20,498 --> 00:38:21,362
我每天晚上没有你的话
Don't I wait for you every night?

846
00:38:21,565 --> 00:38:22,554
怎么能够睡得着
How can I sleep without you?

847
00:38:23,167 --> 00:38:24,031
你等我呀
Wait for me.

848
00:38:24,935 --> 00:38:27,130
小心点，慢慢走！
Watch your step. Go slow.

849
00:38:48,125 --> 00:38:49,217
你干什么嘛炳叔？
What are you doing, Uncle Bing?

850
00:38:50,995 --> 00:38:51,757
这有什么关系呀
What does it matter?

851
00:38:51,962 --> 00:38:53,293
过来让我亲亲你
Just let me give you a little kiss.

852
00:38:54,031 --> 00:38:58,058
炳叔，你别走过来，不要…
Uncle, don't come any closer! No!

853
00:38:58,436 --> 00:38:59,801
这有什么不好
What's the big deal?

854
00:39:00,237 --> 00:39:02,364
其实我每天晚上都在想着你
Actually I think of you every night,

855
00:39:02,573 --> 00:39:03,972
不过那个老八老看着我
but what can I do with the missus around?

856
00:39:04,175 --> 00:39:07,633
我没有办法，看你嫩皮白肉
Look at you, so young and fresh;

857
00:39:08,279 --> 00:39:09,769
那个老八她怎能跟你比呀
how can that old trout compare with you?

858
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:10,776
过来让我亲亲
Come. Give me a kiss.

859
00:39:11,816 --> 00:39:14,046
不要，不要，你让开
No! Leave me alone!

860
00:39:15,353 --> 00:39:15,842
没关系嘛
What's the big deal?

861
00:39:16,053 --> 00:39:18,112
你不要这样，炳叔你别过来
No! Uncle, don't come any closer

862
00:39:20,558 --> 00:39:21,217
不要
No! No!

863
00:39:21,425 --> 00:39:21,754
这有什么关系
What is it!

864
00:39:21,959 --> 00:39:23,358
炳叔，你别过来
Uncle Bing, don't come any closer!

865
00:39:23,561 --> 00:39:25,256
你过来我就喊救命
If you do, I'll scream!

866
00:39:25,796 --> 00:39:26,728
不要
No, don't!

867
00:39:28,065 --> 00:39:29,396
救命啊
Help!

868
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:32,125
着火啦，着火啦
Fire, fire!

869
00:39:32,336 --> 00:39:33,667
大家快来救火啊！
Fire! Put out the fire!

870
00:39:34,205 --> 00:39:35,331
快点打电话吧！
Call the fire brigade!

871
00:39:35,673 --> 00:39:37,538
救火啊，救火啊
Fire! Fire!

872
00:39:38,476 --> 00:39:40,205
阿香，没事吧？     没事
Ah Heung, are you all right? -Yes, I'm OK.

873
00:39:41,011 --> 00:39:42,376
着火啦，着火啦
Fire!, Fire!

874
00:39:43,447 --> 00:39:45,005
五叔，五叔
Uncle Hu! Uncle Hu!

875
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:51,385
不好了，着火啊
Fire! Put out the fire!

876
00:39:51,956 --> 00:39:53,116
快救火啊
Put out the fire!

877
00:39:54,558 --> 00:39:55,149
什么事呀？
What's the matter?

878
00:39:55,359 --> 00:39:56,690
着火了
Fire!

879
00:39:57,361 --> 00:39:59,226
你的铃呢！     铃都掉了
Where's your bell? -I lost it.

880
00:39:59,764 --> 00:40:00,628
快跑呀！
Run!

881
00:40:05,403 --> 00:40:07,667
着火了，快救火啊
Fire! Help put out the fire!

882
00:40:08,406 --> 00:40:09,464
快救火啊
Help put out the fire!

883
00:40:09,807 --> 00:40:10,899
发仔，哪儿着火了？
Fat Chai, where's the fire?

884
00:40:11,308 --> 00:40:13,333
我也不知道，我正在干活
I don't know. I was working,

885
00:40:13,544 --> 00:40:14,704
听楼上阿香喊救命
then I heard Ah Heung cry for help,

886
00:40:14,912 --> 00:40:15,435
我以为着火呢！
so I thought there was a fire.

887
00:40:15,646 --> 00:40:17,944
你这死发仔，我楼上哪儿着火了
Damned kid! Where the hell's the fire?

888
00:40:18,616 --> 00:40:20,106
不着火，阿香喊救命干什么？
If there's no fire, why did she cry for help?

889
00:40:21,685 --> 00:40:24,119
你说，说，阿香你说
Ah Hsiang, you tell me.

890
00:40:24,422 --> 00:40:25,684
我…
I...

891
00:40:25,890 --> 00:40:26,982
怕什么，这么多人
Don't be afraid. There's so many people here.

892
00:40:28,993 --> 00:40:29,960
我告诉你，阿香
I'm warning you, Ah Heung,

893
00:40:30,161 --> 00:40:30,786
你要敢说一句
if you dare say a word,

894
00:40:30,995 --> 00:40:31,654
等你妈回来就打死你
I'll have your Ma beat you to death.

895
00:40:31,862 --> 00:40:32,453
我没…
I...didn't...

896
00:40:32,663 --> 00:40:33,721
你再说，你敢说
You wouldn't dare.

897
00:40:33,931 --> 00:40:34,556
还不跟我回去
Come home with me.

898
00:40:34,932 --> 00:40:36,559
没事了，大家回去了
All right, show's over, break it up.

899
00:40:38,335 --> 00:40:39,427
救火车来了
The firemen are here.

900
00:40:40,171 --> 00:40:41,263
让开，让开
Make way! Make way!

901
00:40:41,605 --> 00:40:42,799
走开，走开
Move back! Move back!

902
00:40:43,007 --> 00:40:45,100
救火呀，走开
Fire! Move back!

903
00:40:45,476 --> 00:40:46,875
跟我来，跟我来
Follow me! Follow me!

904
00:40:47,278 --> 00:40:48,540
在前面，跟我来
Right over here. Follow me!

905
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:51,004
这儿才是九十六号嘛
Here's No. 96!

906
00:40:51,215 --> 00:40:52,842
来，走，走
Come on.

907
00:40:53,050 --> 00:40:55,348
慢着，外边你可看好
Wait. You keep watch out here.

908
00:40:55,553 --> 00:40:56,918
走
Go!

909
00:40:58,489 --> 00:40:59,751
谁是房东？
Who's the landlord?

910
00:40:59,957 --> 00:41:01,754
我是，我就是
That's me, that's me.

911
00:41:02,660 --> 00:41:04,218
原来是你呀，大黑痣
So it's you, Big Mole.

912
00:41:04,829 --> 00:41:05,693
什么事？     听着
What's going on? -Listen.

913
00:41:08,265 --> 00:41:09,129
里边可以放水了吗？
Can we turn the tap on now?

914
00:41:09,533 --> 00:41:10,397
慢等，正在谈呢？
Wait. We're still negotiating.

915
00:41:11,335 --> 00:41:11,960
听着
Listen.

916
00:41:12,336 --> 00:41:13,496
有钱有水，没钱没水
Cash equals splash, no cash no splash.

917
00:41:13,704 --> 00:41:15,194
要水给钱，没钱没水
You pay we spray, no pay no stay.

918
00:41:17,441 --> 00:41:19,068
对不起，你们再说清楚点好不好
Sorry, could you explain that again please?

919
00:41:20,478 --> 00:41:23,038
你真是麻烦，听清楚点
What a nuisance. Listen carefully.

920
00:41:24,014 --> 00:41:24,810
听着，听着
Listen.

921
00:41:25,015 --> 00:41:26,243
有钱有水，没钱没水
Cash equals splash, no cash no splash.

922
00:41:26,450 --> 00:41:28,350
要水给钱，没钱没水
You pay we spray, no pay no stay.

923
00:41:30,588 --> 00:41:31,418
你们要钱是不是
You're asking for money?

924
00:41:31,822 --> 00:41:34,416
当然了，没有钱有什么好谈的
Of course, no money, no talk.

925
00:41:35,459 --> 00:41:36,585
别啰啰嗦苏的，快点呀
You'd better make up your mind quickly.

926
00:41:37,127 --> 00:41:38,151
要不然我们就不管了
The pipe might get blocked any minute.

927
00:41:40,231 --> 00:41:41,892
哥儿们，你们全弄错了
Brothers, you've made a mistake.

928
00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:43,925
这个地方根本没有着火
There's no fire here!

929
00:41:45,102 --> 00:41:45,830
没着火！
No fire?

930
00:41:48,739 --> 00:41:49,763
太不像话     就是
Preposterous! -You said it.

931
00:41:50,975 --> 00:41:52,135
你骗我们
Are you having us on?

932
00:41:52,676 --> 00:41:54,075
没着火就叫我们来
Why call us if there's no fire?

933
00:41:54,345 --> 00:41:55,403
是谁打电话？
Who made the call?

934
00:41:55,613 --> 00:41:58,047
打电话的是我，喊着火的是他
I did, but he's the one who yelled "fire".

935
00:41:59,316 --> 00:42:00,283
你的罪过可大了
This is a serious transgression.

936
00:42:00,618 --> 00:42:01,243
过来
Quick, quick.

937
00:42:01,785 --> 00:42:03,082
叫什么名，干什么的？
Name and profession?

938
00:42:03,854 --> 00:42:04,878
我叫发仔，补鞋的
My name's Fat Chai. I'm a cobbler.

939
00:42:05,623 --> 00:42:06,282
补鞋的
A cobbler?

940
00:42:08,392 --> 00:42:11,088
小曾，补鞋的没有钱的
Cheng, cobblers don't have money.

941
00:42:11,695 --> 00:42:15,563
我知道了，大黑痣过来
I know. Big mole, come here.

942
00:42:17,268 --> 00:42:18,360
我们现在新规定
According to our new regulations,

943
00:42:18,569 --> 00:42:19,900
叫着火的无罪
the one who yells fire gets off,

944
00:42:20,104 --> 00:42:21,765
打电话的要负全责
but whoever calls it in is responsible.

945
00:42:22,106 --> 00:42:24,040
还有我们一到了现场
Also, once we're at the scene,

946
00:42:24,241 --> 00:42:26,436
就照样要放水兼拆房子
we must hose the house and demolish it.

947
00:42:26,911 --> 00:42:27,775
拆房子？
Demolish the house?

948
00:42:28,579 --> 00:42:31,605
因为我们怕有炉子什么碰倒了
In case a stove or something turns over

949
00:42:31,815 --> 00:42:33,874
容易引起真的火灾来
and causes a real fire.

950
00:42:34,184 --> 00:42:35,481
没错，拆房子
Right. Level the house!

951
00:42:40,724 --> 00:42:41,850
不要拆房子啊！
No, don't!

952
00:42:42,159 --> 00:42:43,786
有话慢慢说嘛
Iet's talk this over.

953
00:42:45,763 --> 00:42:48,323
兄弟啊，美人说句话就是不同
Thus speaketh the beauty, lads.

954
00:42:49,033 --> 00:42:50,694
大黑痣，你该知道了
Big Mole, you know the score.

955
00:42:52,403 --> 00:42:53,734
兄弟，那你开个价吧
You name a price.

956
00:42:54,371 --> 00:42:55,360
起码一条黄金
At the very least, one gold bar.

957
00:42:55,739 --> 00:42:56,797
你说什么，一条黄金
What? One gold bar?

958
00:42:57,241 --> 00:42:58,003
就这个破房子
For this delapidated house?

959
00:42:58,842 --> 00:43:01,606
破房子，破房子就是危楼
A delapidated house is dangerous.

960
00:43:02,146 --> 00:43:05,115
拆     不能拆
Level it. -No!

961
00:43:06,650 --> 00:43:09,414
老八，这几个死小子很难对付
These guys are hard to handle.

962
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:12,054
我看你不拿点钱出来很难办了
I think you had better pay them off.

963
00:43:12,256 --> 00:43:12,585
怎么办？
What should we do?

964
00:43:12,790 --> 00:43:13,552
这是什么？
What's this?

965
00:43:16,527 --> 00:43:17,755
干什么？
Why are you taking my bracelet?

966
00:43:17,962 --> 00:43:19,054
喝杯茶
Treat yourself to a drink.

967
00:43:20,230 --> 00:43:21,254
这是真的，不假的
This is genuine, is it not?

968
00:43:21,565 --> 00:43:22,327
这是真金吧？
Real gold?

969
00:43:22,533 --> 00:43:23,295
那还错得了吗？
Of course!

970
00:43:23,934 --> 00:43:26,095
不只，还有
We need more than that.

971
00:43:27,304 --> 00:43:28,862
这就当给我点面子吧！
Come on, give me a bit of face.

972
00:43:29,873 --> 00:43:30,897
给点面子
Come on, give me a bit of face.

973
00:43:31,108 --> 00:43:32,973
行，这个还给你
All right. This is yours.

974
00:43:33,577 --> 00:43:34,703
够意思   这个是我的
Great. -This is mine.

975
00:43:34,912 --> 00:43:35,674
够朋友
You're a pal.

976
00:43:36,213 --> 00:43:37,612
大黑痣，你住哪儿？
Big Mole, which flat is yours?

977
00:43:37,815 --> 00:43:39,009
上面，最漂亮那间
The nicest one, up there.

978
00:43:39,216 --> 00:43:39,978
就在上面
That one up there.

979
00:43:40,184 --> 00:43:40,673
请上去喝杯茶…
Come up and have some tea.

980
00:43:40,884 --> 00:43:45,344
等等，兄弟，上面最漂亮那间
In a while, lads. The nicest one up there.

981
00:43:45,556 --> 00:43:46,284
你明白了吗？
Understood?

982
00:43:47,358 --> 00:43:49,849
弟兄们，拆最漂亮那间
Level the nicest one, lads.

983
00:43:50,060 --> 00:43:51,357
是
Yes sir!

984
00:43:51,562 --> 00:43:53,359
不能拆，不能拆
No! No!

985
00:43:53,564 --> 00:43:56,465
我给你，我全部都给你，给你…
I'll give you everything! Everything!

986
00:43:56,667 --> 00:43:58,259
阿炳，你还有一个挂表
Ah Bing, you still have a pocket watch.

987
00:43:58,469 --> 00:43:59,458
全都给了他们
Give them everything!

988
00:44:02,506 --> 00:44:03,234
没有
There's nothing,

989
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:04,907
这个没什么的
there's really nothing.

990
00:44:05,576 --> 00:44:06,406
你干什么呢？
What are you doing?

991
00:44:07,011 --> 00:44:10,003
我们来的多，每个人只能分一点
There's not enough to go round so many of us.

992
00:44:11,415 --> 00:44:12,177
拆好了没有？
Are you finished in there?

993
00:44:12,583 --> 00:44:14,414
钱到了，走人
We got the money. Let's go.

994
00:44:18,255 --> 00:44:20,723
记着，以后要是真的着火
Remember, if ever you have a real fire,

995
00:44:20,924 --> 00:44:22,915
最要紧的是打电话找我
be sure to call us.

996
00:44:24,261 --> 00:44:25,558
再见
Bye!

997
00:44:29,366 --> 00:44:30,924
你们这些绝子绝孙的
You god damn bastards!

998
00:44:31,268 --> 00:44:33,463
你们这样做还不如去抢
They're no better than robbers.

999
00:44:35,739 --> 00:44:39,869
买了，买了，买了就有
Come on, place your bets.

1000
00:44:40,077 --> 00:44:41,601
买了，买了
Come on, place your bets.

1001
00:44:48,018 --> 00:44:48,985
开！
Open!

1002
00:44:59,830 --> 00:45:01,092
森哥，换班了
Brother Shum, we've just changed shifts.

1003
00:45:01,932 --> 00:45:03,399
这么快你就下班啦？
Off work so soon?

1004
00:45:04,435 --> 00:45:05,663
快就快了点
Yes, it is a bit soon.

1005
00:45:05,869 --> 00:45:07,996
虽然这条街是你地方
This is your street.

1006
00:45:08,205 --> 00:45:09,365
我少来
I'm not here often.

1007
00:45:10,541 --> 00:45:12,008
你在这儿等我
Wait for me here.

1008
00:45:13,811 --> 00:45:15,278
买了，买了就有
Place your bets.

1009
00:45:15,479 --> 00:45:17,174
钟哥，三六九来了在那边
Brother Chung, 369 is over there.

1010
00:45:17,748 --> 00:45:19,682
妈的，拿点钱给他花吧
Damn! Give him some money.

1011
00:45:22,619 --> 00:45:23,745
胖子，拿那衣服来
Fatso, hand me my jacket.

1012
00:45:25,989 --> 00:45:26,478
这儿就交给你了
I'm leaving you in charge.

1013
00:45:26,690 --> 00:45:27,588
好，你放心吧
Don't worry, leave it to me.

1014
00:45:27,791 --> 00:45:30,316
买，买
Place your bets!

1015
00:45:30,527 --> 00:45:34,088
开，开
Opening up!

1016
00:45:34,565 --> 00:45:35,429
买，买
Place your bets!

1017
00:45:35,632 --> 00:45:37,122
买定离手
Hands off the table!

1018
00:45:39,103 --> 00:45:40,001
三六九   怎么这么少？
369 -ls that all?

1019
00:45:40,337 --> 00:45:42,100
今天生意不好吗
Yes, business is bad tonight.

1020
00:45:42,506 --> 00:45:43,336
不好
Bad?

1021
00:45:44,174 --> 00:45:45,732
刚才开完一二，买三吧！
It was 1 and 2 just now. Try 3!

1022
00:45:47,211 --> 00:45:49,008
我偏不买三，我买四
Not 3. I'll bet on 4.

1023
00:45:49,780 --> 00:45:51,213
阿朱，买四
Ah Chu, I'm betting on 4.

1024
00:45:51,415 --> 00:45:52,404
好的，好小子
Very well, kid.

1025
00:45:53,717 --> 00:45:54,513
三六九，你买四
369. Your betting on 4.

1026
00:45:54,952 --> 00:45:59,548
开，摊开三
There it is. Three!

1027
00:46:05,462 --> 00:46:07,054
三六九，我找你好半天了
369, I've been looking for you all day!

1028
00:46:07,264 --> 00:46:07,992
你到哪儿去了？
Where have you been?

1029
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:10,862
炳哥，什么事啊？
What's the matter, Brother Bing?

1030
00:46:11,235 --> 00:46:11,599
我告诉你
I'm telling you,

1031
00:46:11,802 --> 00:46:13,531
昨天晚上丢了很多金条
I lost a lot of gold bars last night.

1032
00:46:13,937 --> 00:46:15,564
谁那么大胆敢偷你的东西？
Who'd dare steal from you?

1033
00:46:15,939 --> 00:46:17,930
别说这么多了，我慢慢再告诉你
I'll tell you the details later.

1034
00:46:18,675 --> 00:46:20,472
你听着，明天你到都顺街
Listen, go to To Shun Street tomorrow,

1035
00:46:20,677 --> 00:46:22,406
九十六号陈园那里
Look for no. 96, Chan Yuen.

1036
00:46:22,679 --> 00:46:24,670
陈园？我没去过
Chan Yuen? I've never been there.

1037
00:46:24,882 --> 00:46:26,372
没有去过，你去找嘛
That's why you need to look for it.

1038
00:46:27,251 --> 00:46:27,774
你记着
Remember. Once you're there,

1039
00:46:27,985 --> 00:46:30,112
一到那儿就抓那个补鞋的发仔
arrest Fat Chai, the cobbler.

1040
00:46:31,588 --> 00:46:33,249
一、二、三
One, two, three.

1041
00:46:33,657 --> 00:46:35,215
一、二、三
One, two, three.

1042
00:46:35,759 --> 00:46:37,056
一、二
One, two.

1043
00:46:41,765 --> 00:46:45,963
一、二、一、二…
One, two, one two.

1044
00:46:46,170 --> 00:46:48,798
四妹，拿口袋去买米了
Fourth sister, let's go buy some rice.

1045
00:46:49,006 --> 00:46:49,734
我先去拿钱
I'll go get the money.

1046
00:46:51,308 --> 00:46:53,435
发仔哥，你要不要买点东西？
Fat Chai, is there anything you need?

1047
00:46:53,977 --> 00:46:55,808
不要买什么了，谢谢福嫂
Nothing, thanks, Mrs Fook.

1048
00:46:56,747 --> 00:46:57,771
好，我们走吧
OK. Let's go

1049
00:46:59,783 --> 00:47:00,647
发仔哥，我们走了
See you later, Fat Chai.

1050
00:47:01,285 --> 00:47:02,183
再见！  再见！
Bye! -Bye!

1051
00:47:06,790 --> 00:47:10,089
发仔哥，发仔哥，这回我完了
Fat Chai! I'm really in trouble this time!

1052
00:47:10,294 --> 00:47:11,158
什么事？
What's wrong?

1053
00:47:11,361 --> 00:47:12,726
就在着火那天晚上
Ma found out what happened

1054
00:47:12,930 --> 00:47:15,262
我妈知道了炳叔的事
with Uncle Bing on the night of the fire.

1055
00:47:15,465 --> 00:47:16,796
他们两大吵了一场
They had a huge argument

1056
00:47:17,401 --> 00:47:18,766
现在还要把我卖到导游社
and now they want to sell me

1057
00:47:18,969 --> 00:47:19,731
做导游女
to a travel agency to be a tour guide.

1058
00:47:19,937 --> 00:47:20,801
什么话
What?

1059
00:47:22,306 --> 00:47:23,637
那种地方你也能去
How can they send you to such a place?

1060
00:47:24,241 --> 00:47:25,435
那不等于妓女吗？
That's just like becoming a prostitute!

1061
00:47:25,642 --> 00:47:27,075
所以呀，发仔哥
Fat Chai, you must help me this time!

1062
00:47:27,544 --> 00:47:29,011
这回你要救救我
Fat Chai, you must help me this time!

1063
00:47:29,513 --> 00:47:30,445
这怎么办？
What shall I do now?

1064
00:47:33,083 --> 00:47:33,981
不如这样吧
Let's do this. Go straight to the police station

1065
00:47:34,184 --> 00:47:36,209
你马上去分局，告他们迫良为娼
and say they're forcing you into prostitution.

1066
00:47:37,287 --> 00:47:39,812
九十六号陈园，没错
No. 96, Chan Yuen. This is it.

1067
00:47:40,190 --> 00:47:41,088
刚好巡警来
Perfect! Here comes a policeman.

1068
00:47:41,925 --> 00:47:44,223
兄弟，这儿是不是有个叫…
Pal, is there someone here called...

1069
00:47:44,428 --> 00:47:45,725
巡警先生
Mr Policeman,

1070
00:47:45,929 --> 00:47:47,760
这位大姑娘正要找你有事
this young lady needs to talk to you.

1071
00:47:51,034 --> 00:47:53,662
会有这么漂亮的大姑娘要找我
Such a pretty young lady wants to talk to me?

1072
00:47:54,037 --> 00:47:56,062
有什么事？你哭了？
What's the matter? You're crying?

1073
00:47:56,840 --> 00:47:58,137
有什么事情？你说
Tell me what the matter is.

1074
00:47:58,475 --> 00:47:59,203
我…   说啊
I... -Well?

1075
00:48:02,079 --> 00:48:05,071
我知道了，你这小子一定是姓楚
I know. It's you, isn't it?

1076
00:48:05,282 --> 00:48:06,374
楚完溜，是不是？
You humped her and dumped her, right?

1077
00:48:06,583 --> 00:48:08,414
你别在胡说
Shut your big mouth!

1078
00:48:08,819 --> 00:48:10,252
我胡说
My big mouth?

1079
00:48:10,454 --> 00:48:12,922
我一看见你就知道你不是好人
I knew you were no good the moment I saw you.

1080
00:48:13,457 --> 00:48:14,981
大姑娘，你不用怕
Don't be afraid, young lady.

1081
00:48:15,192 --> 00:48:16,682
有什么事情你尽管说好了
Whatever it is, you can tell me.

1082
00:48:16,894 --> 00:48:18,521
只要医生证明你破了
Once a doctor proves you've been deflowered,

1083
00:48:18,729 --> 00:48:19,991
我马上就会抓他
I'll arrest him immediately!

1084
00:48:21,365 --> 00:48:22,889
你不要瞎猫捉死耗子好不好
Don't jump to crazy conclusions!

1085
00:48:23,300 --> 00:48:24,426
这件事不关我的事
It's got nothing to do with me.

1086
00:48:24,635 --> 00:48:26,466
不关你的事难道还关我的事？
Nothing to do with you?

1087
00:48:26,970 --> 00:48:28,631
这种事情还能两个人一块来吗？
So who did it? Me?

1088
00:48:28,839 --> 00:48:30,363
这件事她妈…
It's her mother...

1089
00:48:30,574 --> 00:48:31,632
你还在骂人？
Now you're trying to blame her mother?

1090
00:48:31,842 --> 00:48:33,070
不干不净的他妈他妈的
Why drag her mother into this?

1091
00:48:33,277 --> 00:48:35,177
我妈可没有得罪你？
What did her mother ever do to you?

1092
00:48:35,612 --> 00:48:36,670
我是说这件事
What I'm trying to say is,

1093
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:38,472
是她妈逼她去做生意
her mother's forcing her into "business".

1094
00:48:40,150 --> 00:48:41,412
怎么说你就不对了
What's wrong with that?

1095
00:48:41,752 --> 00:48:43,913
大姑娘，你自己想一想
Think about it, young lady.

1096
00:48:44,121 --> 00:48:45,884
做生意吗要赚钱
Going into business means making money.

1097
00:48:46,089 --> 00:48:49,183
有钱你都不肯赚，你今年几岁？
Don't you want money? How old are you?

1098
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:51,088
十九岁
Nineteen.

1099
00:48:51,495 --> 00:48:52,621
十九岁还小？
19. You're not a kid anymore!

1100
00:48:52,829 --> 00:48:54,387
我十六岁就接生意了
I started doing business when I was 16.

1101
00:48:56,133 --> 00:48:57,998
你知不知道她妈叫她做什么生意
Do you know what kind of business?

1102
00:48:58,335 --> 00:48:58,858
做什么生意？
What kind of business?

1103
00:48:59,069 --> 00:49:00,127
做导游女
To be a so-called "tour guide".

1104
00:49:00,704 --> 00:49:02,831
导游女，那不就是妓女？
Tour guide? That's being a prostitute!

1105
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:03,734
就是了
Isn't that so!

1106
00:49:04,942 --> 00:49:07,206
十九岁就做妓女，不是小一点
A 19-year-old prostitute's a bit young.

1107
00:49:07,644 --> 00:49:09,168
那你又说你十六岁就出来接客
You said you started yourself at 1 6.

1108
00:49:10,080 --> 00:49:11,377
我那是做那种生意的？
I didn't mean that kind of business!

1109
00:49:11,581 --> 00:49:12,206
怎么？
What business was it?

1110
00:49:12,416 --> 00:49:14,543
我是接火柴盒回家里去做的
I made matchboxes at home.

1111
00:49:16,186 --> 00:49:18,950
那有那样的母亲逼女儿去做妓女
What mother forces her kid to be a whore?

1112
00:49:19,156 --> 00:49:19,747
她母亲呢？
Where's her mother?

1113
00:49:19,957 --> 00:49:21,185
她不是她亲生的母亲
She's not her real mother.

1114
00:49:21,391 --> 00:49:22,824
她是买回来的
She bought her.

1115
00:49:24,161 --> 00:49:27,062
怪不得呢？她有罪啊！
No wonder! That makes her guilty.

1116
00:49:27,698 --> 00:49:29,723
你可以告她逼良为娼
You can charge her.

1117
00:49:30,067 --> 00:49:30,624
发仔哥
Fat Chai, is that true?

1118
00:49:30,834 --> 00:49:31,391
是不是真的？
Fat hai, is that true?

1119
00:49:31,768 --> 00:49:33,099
当然是真的了，骗你是王八蛋
Sure! I wouldn't lie to you.

1120
00:49:33,303 --> 00:49:35,168
告诉我，我马上去把她抓回来
Tell me where I can arrest her.

1121
00:49:35,706 --> 00:49:37,731
阿香，这就不用怕了
Ah Heung, you don't have to be scared now.

1122
00:49:39,376 --> 00:49:40,308
想不到巡警里头
I never thought there'd be such a good man

1123
00:49:40,510 --> 00:49:41,704
也会有你这种大好人
among the ranks of you policemen.

1124
00:49:43,914 --> 00:49:46,348
其实你们一看见我
From the moment you saw me

1125
00:49:46,550 --> 00:49:49,644
就应该知道我三六九是个大好人
you should have known 369 is a great guy.

1126
00:49:50,587 --> 00:49:52,680
还有那些聋子、哑吧、瞎子
Those deaf, mute and blind people people

1127
00:49:52,889 --> 00:49:54,880
都以为我是包公再世呢
all think I'm Justice incarnate!

1128
00:49:55,092 --> 00:49:56,252
好了，不要再说了
All right, no more chit-chat.

1129
00:49:56,660 --> 00:49:58,321
快去抓他妈去吧     行
go arrest her mother. -Righto.

1130
00:50:00,297 --> 00:50:01,093
慢着
Hold it. I didn't come here for this.

1131
00:50:02,432 --> 00:50:04,627
我到这儿来不是为这件事的
Hold it. I didn't come here for this.

1132
00:50:06,069 --> 00:50:07,058
我为什么事呢？
What did I come here for?

1133
00:50:07,371 --> 00:50:08,201
是不是来抓人？
Did you come to arrest someone?

1134
00:50:08,405 --> 00:50:09,599
没错，抓人
That's right, to arrest someone.

1135
00:50:10,007 --> 00:50:10,666
抓谁呢？
Arrest who?

1136
00:50:12,576 --> 00:50:15,477
抓谁呢？我抓谁呢？
Arrest who? Who am I arresting?

1137
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:20,548
阿香，你这死丫头原来躲在这儿
Ah Heung! So there you are, you damned girl!

1138
00:50:20,851 --> 00:50:21,681
这就是她妈！
That's her mother!

1139
00:50:21,885 --> 00:50:23,819
我知道了，你听着
Got it. Listen, you.

1140
00:50:24,021 --> 00:50:24,817
死八婆
You old witch!

1141
00:50:25,022 --> 00:50:27,991
听说你要把女儿卖给导游社
You're selling your daughter to an agency.

1142
00:50:28,291 --> 00:50:30,020
这就是逼良为娼
That's forcing her into prostitution.

1143
00:50:30,327 --> 00:50:31,726
你有罪，跟我到警察局去
That's a criminal ofence. Come with me.

1144
00:50:34,698 --> 00:50:36,893
我把她从小买了回来养到这么大
I bought her when she was a child.

1145
00:50:37,100 --> 00:50:38,124
我花了多少钱
I spent a lot of money raising her.

1146
00:50:38,468 --> 00:50:39,958
我现在把她卖给别人
So now I'm selling her on to someone else.

1147
00:50:40,170 --> 00:50:41,000
没什么不对
What's so wrong with that?

1148
00:50:41,605 --> 00:50:43,300
你这个臭娘们，你那么想钱
What a bitch! If you want money,

1149
00:50:43,507 --> 00:50:45,338
为什么不自己去卖
why don't you go sell yourself?

1150
00:50:45,542 --> 00:50:46,668
你看你那副德性
Look at you!

1151
00:50:46,877 --> 00:50:49,505
长得歪里歪斜，八歪八扭的
What a crooked-looking face!

1152
00:50:49,713 --> 00:50:51,704
我一看你就知道你不是个好人
I knew you were no good the moment I saw you.

1153
00:50:54,184 --> 00:50:57,381
你看看我们长得多帅，多自然
Look at how nice we look, how natural.

1154
00:50:57,587 --> 00:50:58,952
你只要仔细一看
If you look closely,

1155
00:50:59,156 --> 00:51:00,088
就知道我们三个
you'll see that all three of us

1156
00:51:00,290 --> 00:51:02,758
是道道地地的正人君子
are regualr, authentic good people!

1157
00:51:03,927 --> 00:51:04,393
看够了没有
Seen enough?

1158
00:51:04,594 --> 00:51:05,788
走，跟我到警察局去
Come with me to the station!

1159
00:51:07,330 --> 00:51:08,729
你这个混蛋在这儿干什么？
You idiot! What're you standing there for?

1160
00:51:09,199 --> 00:51:10,598
太子炳怎么你这么巧也在这儿
Master Bing, what a coincidence!

1161
00:51:10,801 --> 00:51:11,495
我…
I...

1162
00:51:13,703 --> 00:51:15,136
我找到一条财路
I've discovered a way to make money.

1163
00:51:15,338 --> 00:51:15,963
什么财路？
What way?

1164
00:51:16,606 --> 00:51:18,233
有个八婆想逼良为娼
Someone's forcing girls into prostitution.

1165
00:51:18,942 --> 00:51:19,931
那你得多要点了
Then you must put the squeeze on her.

1166
00:51:20,143 --> 00:51:21,303
当然了，这还用你教吗？
Of course! I know what to do.

1167
00:51:22,312 --> 00:51:23,404
那个八婆在哪儿？
Where's this no-good bitch?

1168
00:51:25,816 --> 00:51:26,680
你这个该死的
You god damned bastard!

1169
00:51:27,184 --> 00:51:30,119
你眼睛瞎了，她是我老婆
Are you blind? That's my wife!

1170
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:32,550
太子炳，你不用骗我
Master Bing, what a kidder you are!

1171
00:51:32,756 --> 00:51:34,724
你老婆肥婆四我认识
I know who your wife is. Fat Woman Sei!

1172
00:51:34,925 --> 00:51:35,357
死一边去
Go to hell!

1173
00:51:35,559 --> 00:51:37,026
阿炳，谁个肥婆四？
Ah Bing, who's Fat Woman Sei?

1174
00:51:37,227 --> 00:51:38,956
没事，你这该死的，叫嫂子呀
Nothing. You idiot, say hello to my wife!

1175
00:51:39,596 --> 00:51:40,290
这个也是嫂子？
This one's your wife too?

1176
00:51:40,497 --> 00:51:41,156
什么？
What?

1177
00:51:41,498 --> 00:51:42,692
没事，没事
Nothing, nothing.

1178
00:51:42,899 --> 00:51:43,695
快叫呀
Greet her, quick.

1179
00:51:44,534 --> 00:51:45,296
阿嫂
Ma'am.

1180
00:51:48,705 --> 00:51:49,797
你这个该死的东西
You stupid fool!

1181
00:51:50,006 --> 00:51:51,166
我叫你来抓发仔
I told you to arrest Fat Chai!

1182
00:51:51,374 --> 00:51:52,341
你抓我老婆干什么？
What are you doing arresting my wife?

1183
00:51:54,344 --> 00:51:57,575
对了，我明明是进来抓补鞋仔的
That's right. I came to arrest the cobbler.

1184
00:51:57,781 --> 00:51:58,805
发仔在哪儿？
Where's Fat Chai?

1185
00:51:59,449 --> 00:52:00,177
他不就是啦！
That's him right there.

1186
00:52:02,352 --> 00:52:02,841
那个就是呀！
That's him.

1187
00:52:03,053 --> 00:52:03,451
不就是他吗！
That's him?

1188
00:52:03,653 --> 00:52:04,984
你听着，我先上楼上去
Listen, I'm going up.

1189
00:52:05,188 --> 00:52:06,746
这件事情交给你办     好
You sort things out here. -OK!

1190
00:52:07,491 --> 00:52:09,288
回去，回去，你这个死丫头
Come with me, you damned girl!

1191
00:52:09,493 --> 00:52:10,824
快抓她，快抓她
Arrest her! Quick, arrest her!

1192
00:52:11,161 --> 00:52:11,650
我现在要抓你
You're under arrest.

1193
00:52:11,862 --> 00:52:14,057
阿炳，快实说，谁是肥婆四
Ah Bing, the truth. Who's Fat Woman Sei?

1194
00:52:15,365 --> 00:52:16,195
你干什么？
What are you doing?

1195
00:52:16,700 --> 00:52:17,860
无缘无故你抓我干什么？
Why are you arresting me for no reason?

1196
00:52:18,201 --> 00:52:19,293
什么无缘无故
For no reason?

1197
00:52:19,503 --> 00:52:20,697
我本来就是来抓你的
You're the reason I came in the first place!

1198
00:52:21,371 --> 00:52:23,168
我一进门就看你小子不顺眼
As soon as I stepped through the door,

1199
00:52:23,373 --> 00:52:24,931
我就知道你不是个好人
I knew you were no good.

1200
00:52:25,275 --> 00:52:25,900
这就不对了
That's not right.

1201
00:52:26,109 --> 00:52:27,736
你刚才不是说我是个大好人吗
Didn't you say I was a good guy just now?

1202
00:52:28,311 --> 00:52:29,642
刚才是刚才的事
That was then, this is now.

1203
00:52:29,846 --> 00:52:30,744
去年很多有钱的人
There were lots of rich people last year too

1204
00:52:30,947 --> 00:52:32,380
今天不也变成大闸蟹
who've all gone bankrupt this year!

1205
00:52:33,083 --> 00:52:33,879
多少岁？说！
Age? Speak!

1206
00:52:34,417 --> 00:52:35,042
什么事？
What's going on?

1207
00:52:35,252 --> 00:52:36,048
抽壮丁
It's the draft!

1208
00:52:37,554 --> 00:52:38,543
多少岁，快说
What's your age? Quick!

1209
00:52:39,556 --> 00:52:40,045
二十四岁
Twenty-four.

1210
00:52:40,257 --> 00:52:41,315
正好，中选
Excellent. You're drafted.

1211
00:52:41,758 --> 00:52:43,589
有没有弄错，什么岁数也中选
What? Just on account of my age?

1212
00:52:43,793 --> 00:52:44,987
凡是十八岁到四十岁
Any able-bodied male between 1 8 and 24

1213
00:52:45,195 --> 00:52:46,184
都是壮丁年龄
Any able-bodied male between 1 8 and 24

1214
00:52:46,396 --> 00:52:47,260
你正好就中选了
is elible for the draft.

1215
00:52:47,464 --> 00:52:48,226
跟我到警察局去
Come with me to the station.

1216
00:52:48,832 --> 00:52:49,890
动手动脚的，干什么？
Hey, hands off!

1217
00:52:50,100 --> 00:52:51,067
有话的慢慢的谈吗
Let's discuss this.

1218
00:52:53,236 --> 00:52:54,863
其实我进来一眼看见你
The moment I laid eyes on you

1219
00:52:55,071 --> 00:52:56,333
就知道你这个人很聪明
I knew you were a smart person.

1220
00:52:56,706 --> 00:52:59,004
你要跟我谈一谈，是不是？
You want to discuss things, right?

1221
00:53:05,815 --> 00:53:06,679
干什么？这什么意思？
What do you mean?

1222
00:53:07,017 --> 00:53:08,382
公价人情，五斗米
Standard price. Five pecks of rice.

1223
00:53:08,885 --> 00:53:09,749
你发神经啊？
Have you gone mad?

1224
00:53:11,488 --> 00:53:14,048
夏季大减价，三斗好了
Summer discount. Three pecks.

1225
00:53:14,558 --> 00:53:15,252
你给我？
You're giving it to me?

1226
00:53:18,295 --> 00:53:19,421
就这么说吧
Let's say...

1227
00:53:19,796 --> 00:53:21,263
你给我三块大头好了
you give me 3 HK dollars.

1228
00:53:21,765 --> 00:53:23,790
也没有，我有一条命你要不要？
I don't have it either. Just take my life!

1229
00:53:24,901 --> 00:53:26,300
你这个小子脾气这么硬呀
What a stubborn kid you are!

1230
00:53:28,939 --> 00:53:31,169
干干脆脆给我一块大头好了
Just give me a dollar then.

1231
00:53:31,374 --> 00:53:32,068
去你妈的，没有
Up yours! I don't have it.

1232
00:53:37,247 --> 00:53:37,736
好货
Very well then.

1233
00:53:37,948 --> 00:53:39,677
你干什么，抢东西
What're you doing? This is robbery!

1234
00:53:39,883 --> 00:53:40,679
代罚款，代罚款
It's just a token fine.

1235
00:53:40,884 --> 00:53:41,612
什么代罚款，简直是抢劫
What token fine? It's daylight robbery!

1236
00:53:41,818 --> 00:53:43,115
我三六九还要抢，你真是混帐
I'm a cop, I don't have to rob. Idiot!

1237
00:53:43,320 --> 00:53:45,686
发仔，什么事？什么事？
What's wrong, Fat Chai?

1238
00:53:46,022 --> 00:53:46,954
金医生，他抢我东西
Dr Kim, he's robbing me!

1239
00:53:47,157 --> 00:53:48,784
他是巡警，怎么会抢东西呢
He's a cop, how can he be robbing you?

1240
00:53:49,159 --> 00:53:49,921
他比贼还坏
He's worse than a common thief!

1241
00:53:50,126 --> 00:53:51,753
哎…你说什么？
What are you saying?

1242
00:53:54,030 --> 00:53:56,430
你是不是医生？    是啊！
Are you a doctor? -Yes.

1243
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:57,425
医什么的？
What do you specialise in?

1244
00:53:57,634 --> 00:54:00,194
内科、外科、妇科、牙科
Gynaecology, surgery, dentistry...

1245
00:54:00,403 --> 00:54:03,304
牙科，正好，我这儿有个坏牙
Dentistry? Geat! I've got a rotten tooth.

1246
00:54:03,506 --> 00:54:04,837
帮我拔掉，走…
Take it out for me, will you?

1247
00:54:05,508 --> 00:54:07,271
哎呀，我不会拔牙啊！
I don't know how to pull teeth!

1248
00:54:08,578 --> 00:54:11,809
你这该死的，牙科医生不会拔牙
What kind of dentist doesn't pull teeth?

1249
00:54:14,050 --> 00:54:15,540
你看见我穿这身老虎皮
Is it because of my uniform?

1250
00:54:15,752 --> 00:54:17,344
怕我不给钱是不是
You think I won't pay. Is that it?

1251
00:54:17,787 --> 00:54:19,721
说了半天，这才是良心话
That's the first true thing you said all day.

1252
00:54:19,923 --> 00:54:20,617
你少废话
Shut up.

1253
00:54:22,726 --> 00:54:25,957
老不死的，你是不见棺材不掉泪
You're asking for it, you old fool.

1254
00:54:26,763 --> 00:54:27,787
今年多少岁？
How old are you?

1255
00:54:27,998 --> 00:54:29,431
五十岁，干什么？
Fifty. Why?

1256
00:54:30,634 --> 00:54:35,970
十八，四十，你有没有牌？
18 to 40. Have you got a license?

1257
00:54:37,474 --> 00:54:38,771
我从山东刚到这儿来
I just arrived from Shantung.

1258
00:54:38,975 --> 00:54:39,805
那来的牌？
Where would I get a licence from?

1259
00:54:40,610 --> 00:54:41,668
那你为什么不去领牌？
Why didn't you apply for one?

1260
00:54:42,612 --> 00:54:44,045
我是想去领的
I was intending to,

1261
00:54:44,247 --> 00:54:46,738
可是又要担保，又要证书
but they need guarantees, certificates,

1262
00:54:46,950 --> 00:54:49,316
又要人事，九十几重手续
connections, and dozens of forms filled.

1263
00:54:49,519 --> 00:54:51,043
单在你们牌照部
At the licensing department alone

1264
00:54:51,254 --> 00:54:53,484
就被你们的弟兄骂了一百零八次
I got told off God knows how many times!

1265
00:54:55,425 --> 00:54:57,256
你自己找来骂吗！
You brought it on yourself.

1266
00:54:57,460 --> 00:54:59,655
衙门里的规矩你都不懂
You should know how officialdom operates.

1267
00:55:00,397 --> 00:55:02,092
好了，不用多说了，走吧
OK, no more talk. Let's go!

1268
00:55:02,699 --> 00:55:03,825
没有牌跟我回警察局去
No licence? Back to the station with me!

1269
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:06,691
老兄，帮帮忙行不行？
Please, could you do me a favour this once?

1270
00:55:07,704 --> 00:55:08,898
你这个老不死的
You old fool.

1271
00:55:09,105 --> 00:55:11,835
我都说你是不见棺材不掉泪
I told you you were asking for it.

1272
00:55:12,542 --> 00:55:14,271
你想我不抓你吗？行
You want me to let you go? Sure.

1273
00:55:15,745 --> 00:55:16,837
你给我把牙拔掉
Pull my tooth for me.

1274
00:55:17,047 --> 00:55:19,948
好，我拔，我拔，可是没有家伙
OK, I'll do it. But I need some tools.

1275
00:55:20,750 --> 00:55:22,217
起码得有把钳子
At the very least, a pair of pincers.

1276
00:55:22,419 --> 00:55:23,078
钳子？
Pincers?

1277
00:55:30,327 --> 00:55:30,884
你又偷东西呀？
You're stealing again?

1278
00:55:31,094 --> 00:55:31,560
慢着慢着
Wait a minute.

1279
00:55:31,761 --> 00:55:32,853
把你的东西借用一下
I'm just borrowing your stuff for a moment.

1280
00:55:33,063 --> 00:55:34,553
你想我会偷你的钱
You think I'd steal your money?

1281
00:55:34,764 --> 00:55:35,423
神经病的
You're crazy!

1282
00:55:35,632 --> 00:55:36,257
你才神经病
You are the one who's crazy!

1283
00:55:38,068 --> 00:55:39,433
老兄，帮帮忙
Brother, do me a favour.

1284
00:55:39,969 --> 00:55:41,903
我的鞋跟松了，给我钉一钉
The heel's come loose. Fix it, would you?

1285
00:55:42,505 --> 00:55:43,164
钱呢？
Where's the money?

1286
00:55:43,973 --> 00:55:45,167
大家都是兄弟不用算了
Come on, we're brothers!

1287
00:55:45,375 --> 00:55:46,307
谁跟你做兄弟？
Who's your brother?

1288
00:55:46,509 --> 00:55:51,776
这就叫协助警方，钉紧一点
It's called assisting the police. Fix it!

1289
00:55:52,415 --> 00:55:53,245
神经病
Crazy fool!

1290
00:55:54,551 --> 00:55:55,347
钳子
There, pincers.

1291
00:55:56,119 --> 00:55:57,518
老虎钳，老虎钳怎么行啊！
They're too big. How can I use it?

1292
00:55:57,721 --> 00:55:58,380
什么不成？
Why not?

1293
00:55:59,089 --> 00:56:01,284
想让我抓你回警察局，是不是？
Do you want me to arrest you?

1294
00:56:02,092 --> 00:56:04,652
好，我拔，你坐…坐
OK, OK. Sit down.

1295
00:56:07,764 --> 00:56:08,458
你干什么？
What are you doing?

1296
00:56:08,665 --> 00:56:09,757
我的力气不够
I haven't got the strength.

1297
00:56:11,701 --> 00:56:12,565
踩开点
Bend a little.

1298
00:56:13,503 --> 00:56:14,094
哪一颗啊？
Which one?

1299
00:56:14,904 --> 00:56:18,067
下边…
Down there.

1300
00:56:20,377 --> 00:56:21,639
你的嘴怎么那么臭啊
Your breath really stinks!

1301
00:56:22,112 --> 00:56:23,477
你是不是不刷牙！
Don't you brush your teeth?

1302
00:56:29,319 --> 00:56:30,718
到底是哪一颗？
Which one?

1303
00:56:30,920 --> 00:56:33,115
这个…
This one...

1304
00:56:36,693 --> 00:56:37,660
哪一颗？
Which one is it?

1305
00:56:37,861 --> 00:56:39,624
这个…
This one...

1306
00:56:59,282 --> 00:57:02,046
老不死的，到底有没有拔呀！
Have you pulled it yet, old fool?

1307
00:57:03,286 --> 00:57:05,151
拔了！你看，牙不是在这儿
I've pulled it. Look, here it is.

1308
00:57:06,656 --> 00:57:08,487
你这老不死，你拔错了
You idiot! You pulled the wrong one!

1309
00:57:09,259 --> 00:57:13,286
下边那个才是，你拔了上边那个
It's the one below. You pulled the one on top!

1310
00:57:13,496 --> 00:57:15,225
下边的烂牙还在这儿
The rotten one's still there!

1311
00:57:15,865 --> 00:57:17,332
这不便宜了你，三六九
You got yourself a bargain, 369!

1312
00:57:17,534 --> 00:57:18,694
你爱贪小便宜
You like bargains, don't you?

1313
00:57:18,902 --> 00:57:20,893
这样买一送一很花得来啊！
Buy one, get one free!

1314
00:57:22,439 --> 00:57:23,633
是呀，反正不用钱
That's right, it's free anyway.

1315
00:57:23,840 --> 00:57:25,398
拔两只也没关系
One tooth or two, it doesn't matter.

1316
00:57:25,608 --> 00:57:26,939
你不如把满嘴牙都拔了
Why don't you have them all pulled?

1317
00:57:27,911 --> 00:57:28,878
鞋修好了，怎么样
I've fixed your shoe. How's that?

1318
00:57:29,345 --> 00:57:30,175
放在这儿
Leave it here.

1319
00:57:33,516 --> 00:57:34,414
金医生，来
Come on, Dr Kim.

1320
00:57:34,984 --> 00:57:35,814
我没有力气了
I've got no strength left.

1321
00:57:36,286 --> 00:57:39,016
发仔，帮帮忙     好好
Give me a hand, Fat Chai. -Sure.

1322
00:57:43,159 --> 00:57:45,354
你要了我的命，你大概做惯了强盗
You want to kill me? What are you,

1323
00:57:45,562 --> 00:57:46,051
是不是？
a bandit or something?

1324
00:57:46,262 --> 00:57:47,627
搂住这儿…
Hold tight here.

1325
00:58:02,846 --> 00:58:04,711
金娇、银娇、紫罗莲
Gold, Silver, Violet!

1326
00:58:05,048 --> 00:58:07,778
快点出来见客，快点呀
Come quickly and greet our guests!

1327
00:58:10,153 --> 00:58:11,245
来了
Coming!

1328
00:58:13,857 --> 00:58:15,051
来了
Coming!

1329
00:58:26,035 --> 00:58:26,694
你们快点！
Hurry up!

1330
00:58:26,903 --> 00:58:28,427
客人来了好半天了，走
They've been waiting a long time.

1331
00:58:34,577 --> 00:58:39,014
二少，二少，姑娘们都来了
Sir, the girls are here.

1332
00:58:39,215 --> 00:58:39,943
快进来
Come in quickly.

1333
00:58:43,086 --> 00:58:46,453
二少，还要什么人侍候请快点说
Sir, if you want anyone else, just say so.

1334
00:58:46,656 --> 00:58:48,351
不用了，待一会儿我再要你
That's all right. Maybe I'll have you later.

1335
00:58:48,858 --> 00:58:50,723
你真混蛋，去吧，去吧
You rotter! Go on.

1336
00:58:51,661 --> 00:58:55,028
老板娘   来了
Boss lady! -Coming.

1337
00:59:01,271 --> 00:59:03,068
有什么事，快点说
What's the matter? Out with it quick.

1338
00:59:03,273 --> 00:59:04,638
三六九来了
369 is here.

1339
00:59:08,344 --> 00:59:11,177
三六九，你怎么也中毒了？
369, have you been poisoned?

1340
00:59:13,149 --> 00:59:14,138
钉
Nail!

1341
00:59:14,617 --> 00:59:15,242
搞得生疔啊？
You have a wart?

1342
00:59:15,451 --> 00:59:17,214
你到底有什么事情，快点说
What's the matter? Be quick with it.

1343
00:59:18,154 --> 00:59:19,553
钉你个死人头
Nail your ass!

1344
00:59:19,756 --> 00:59:21,747
是钉棺材盖的钉子
This is a coffin nail!

1345
00:59:22,892 --> 00:59:25,258
我说你们老板？
Where's your boss?

1346
00:59:25,461 --> 00:59:26,689
跟八姑在聊天呢？
He's chatting with Pat Koo.

1347
00:59:27,463 --> 00:59:28,259
你说什么？
What did you say?

1348
00:59:29,032 --> 00:59:32,593
我们那个破屋子值八条黄金？
Our run-down house is worth 8 bars?

1349
00:59:32,802 --> 00:59:34,565
不过我们要空房子
But we want vacant possession.

1350
00:59:36,372 --> 00:59:39,307
因为我们要装修好才能开张的吗
We'll have to rennovate the place.

1351
00:59:41,911 --> 00:59:43,538
阿炳啊！你听见了没有？
Ah Bing, did you hear that?

1352
00:59:43,746 --> 00:59:45,941
我们那破屋子可以值八条黄金啊
Our old house is worth 8 gold bars?

1353
00:59:46,316 --> 00:59:47,442
听见了，你以为我是聋子
I heard you. You think I'm deaf?

1354
00:59:50,820 --> 00:59:55,223
峰哥，你怎能开这么多导游社
How come you have so many travel agencies,

1355
00:59:55,425 --> 00:59:56,323
奉旨的？
Brother Feng? It's as if by imperial decree!

1356
00:59:57,327 --> 00:59:58,419
不是奉旨的
It's not imperial decree.

1357
00:59:58,628 --> 01:00:01,654
不过她的干爹是分局的局长
Her godfather's the police chief, though.

1358
01:00:01,864 --> 01:00:02,888
你这个傻瓜
You stupid fool!

1359
01:00:03,433 --> 01:00:06,061
逢年过节，我要送很多礼的
At festive times, we give a lot of gifts.

1360
01:00:06,436 --> 01:00:09,428
怪不得呢，不过如果查了出来
No wonder! But if he's found out,

1361
01:00:09,639 --> 01:00:11,266
她的干爹不是有麻烦吗？
won't he get into a lot of trouble?

1362
01:00:12,208 --> 01:00:14,574
这怕什么，最多买张飞机票
What's to worry? He can always buy a ticket

1363
01:00:14,777 --> 01:00:16,677
一飞就飞走了
and just fly away from it all.

1364
01:00:16,879 --> 01:00:18,676
不什么事都没有了吗？
What trouble will there be then?

1365
01:00:19,382 --> 01:00:20,849
走开，走开，让我来问他
Make way. I want to ask him something.

1366
01:00:21,050 --> 01:00:23,518
我们那屋子真的值八条黄金吗？
Is our house really worth 8 gold bars?

1367
01:00:23,720 --> 01:00:25,312
当然了，宝贝
Of course, darling.

1368
01:00:25,521 --> 01:00:27,148
老八，我们先把谁赶走？
So who shall we get rid of first?

1369
01:00:27,357 --> 01:00:28,551
那还用问
Do you have to ask?

1370
01:00:28,758 --> 01:00:30,919
当然是那个卖香烟的杨伯了
Uncle Yeung the cigarette vendor, of course.

1371
01:00:31,594 --> 01:00:32,720
八姑，我谢谢你
Pat Koo, I'll thank you

1372
01:00:32,929 --> 01:00:34,226
你不能扔我的东西了
not to throw away my things.

1373
01:00:34,697 --> 01:00:37,723
八姑，你做做好事，我求求你
Pat Koo, I beg you, have pity!

1374
01:00:37,934 --> 01:00:40,994
你叫我以后怎么生活呢？八姑
How will I live if you turn me out?

1375
01:00:41,237 --> 01:00:42,465
杨伯，杨伯，你不要着急呀
Uncle Yeung, don't worry.

1376
01:00:42,672 --> 01:00:44,037
你叫我以后怎么生活呢？
How will I live.

1377
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:45,434
什么事呀？
What's going on?

1378
01:00:46,476 --> 01:00:47,238
八姑，你干什么？
Pat Koo, what are you doing?

1379
01:00:48,044 --> 01:00:49,511
干什么，我要他搬家
What do you think? I'm evicting him.

1380
01:00:50,179 --> 01:00:51,373
要我搬家
She wants me to move out!

1381
01:00:51,614 --> 01:00:54,276
别动手，什么事？
Hold it! What's going on?

1382
01:00:54,617 --> 01:00:55,675
她要赶杨伯走
She's evicting Uncle Yang.

1383
01:00:56,152 --> 01:00:57,119
你为什么赶杨伯走？
Why do you want to get rid of him?

1384
01:00:57,687 --> 01:00:59,382
他交不出房钱，我当然要他搬家
Of course I'm evicting him. He owes rent.

1385
01:00:59,589 --> 01:01:00,214
你当我这儿是什么？
What do you think this place is?

1386
01:01:00,423 --> 01:01:01,617
我这儿是善堂呀？
A charity home?

1387
01:01:03,292 --> 01:01:04,281
他一共欠你多少钱？
How much does he owe you?

1388
01:01:05,061 --> 01:01:07,325
欠得可多了，一个月十斤米
A lot! It's 10 catties of rice a month,

1389
01:01:07,530 --> 01:01:08,690
欠我六个月的房钱
and he owes me for 6 months.

1390
01:01:08,898 --> 01:01:12,129
就是六十斤米，按照市价
That's 60 catties. At the market price,

1391
01:01:12,335 --> 01:01:14,735
六七四十二，就是四十二万
6 x 7=42, that's 420,000.

1392
01:01:15,905 --> 01:01:16,803
就这么多啊？
That much?

1393
01:01:18,207 --> 01:01:20,107
是啊，你有没有？
Yes. Do you have it?

1394
01:01:21,044 --> 01:01:22,636
现在买两个砂锅要多少钱？
How much is it now to buy 2 pots?

1395
01:01:23,312 --> 01:01:24,677
大概十万块左右了
Around 1 00,000.

1396
01:01:24,881 --> 01:01:25,506
就算十万
Let's say 1 00,000 then.

1397
01:01:27,150 --> 01:01:29,141
还有这些杯子、碟子、匙羹
Plus all this crockery, cutlery

1398
01:01:29,352 --> 01:01:31,183
乱七八糟的就算十万吧
and other stuff, another 1 00,000.

1399
01:01:31,621 --> 01:01:33,953
用不了那么多，七万块钱就够了
Not that much. 70,000's enough.

1400
01:01:34,157 --> 01:01:35,181
好，就算七万
OK, 70,000.

1401
01:01:35,792 --> 01:01:38,260
杨伯，她打坏你香烟要弄多少钱
Uncle Yeung, how much for the cigarettes?

1402
01:01:38,628 --> 01:01:41,222
我的香烟大概四万块钱左右
My cigarettes? About 40 thousand.

1403
01:01:41,431 --> 01:01:43,331
四万，七万，十万
40,000, 70,000, 100,000.

1404
01:01:43,533 --> 01:01:44,500
一共是二十一万
That's 210,000 in total.

1405
01:01:45,702 --> 01:01:47,465
这个先拿着，算三个月的房租
You hold this. It's 3 month's rent.

1406
01:01:47,770 --> 01:01:48,668
其余的慢慢给你
You'll get the rest later.

1407
01:01:49,405 --> 01:01:50,497
你干什么？干什么？
What are you doing? What are you doing?

1408
01:01:50,707 --> 01:01:51,298
你有没有弄错你？
What the hell are you playing at?

1409
01:01:51,507 --> 01:01:52,303
当然没弄错了
I'm not playing at anythng.

1410
01:01:52,508 --> 01:01:54,100
怎么你打坏东西不赔？
Don't you have to pay for breaking things?

1411
01:01:54,677 --> 01:01:56,508
打坏了东西还用赔
If I had to pay,

1412
01:01:56,779 --> 01:01:57,905
要赔我就不打了
I wouldn't beak them in the first place.

1413
01:01:59,048 --> 01:02:00,481
打坏东西不用赔，是不是？
So you don't have to pay for breaking things?

1414
01:02:00,683 --> 01:02:01,581
当然不用赔了
Of course not!

1415
01:02:01,784 --> 01:02:04,810
好，大家听着
OK, listen everyone.

1416
01:02:05,021 --> 01:02:06,648
八姑说打坏东西不用赔
She says you can break things without paying!

1417
01:02:07,323 --> 01:02:08,620
那我们上楼把她的东西都打破了
Let's go upstairs and break all her stuff!

1418
01:02:09,258 --> 01:02:10,816
好呀
All right, all right!

1419
01:02:14,030 --> 01:02:16,089
好了，好了，我赔，我赔
I'll pay, I'll pay.

1420
01:02:16,299 --> 01:02:20,235
赔了…
I'll pay, I'll pay.

1421
01:02:21,170 --> 01:02:24,162
死发仔我告诉你，这些算二十一万
Damn you, Fat Chai! That's 210,000,

1422
01:02:24,373 --> 01:02:25,635
但是他还欠我二十一万
but he still owes me another 210,000.

1423
01:02:25,842 --> 01:02:27,605
你今天无论如何要还给我
I must be paid today, no matter what.

1424
01:02:27,810 --> 01:02:29,641
要不然的话，说什么也没有用
Otherwise, there's nothing more to be said.

1425
01:02:30,346 --> 01:02:34,305
快点拿给我，拿来，二十一万
So give it to me. 210,000!

1426
01:02:45,394 --> 01:02:47,419
发仔，我这儿有两万
Fat Chai, I've got 20,000 here.

1427
01:02:50,066 --> 01:02:52,466
发仔，我这儿还有三万块
Fat Chai, I've got another 30,000.

1428
01:02:52,902 --> 01:02:53,800
好，三万
OK, 30,000.

1429
01:02:54,804 --> 01:02:56,101
我这儿有两万，拿去
I have 20,000 here, take it.

1430
01:02:58,374 --> 01:03:00,308

这是三万
Here's 30,000.

1432
01:03:04,046 --> 01:03:05,377
我这儿还有一万块钱
And here's 10,000.

1433
01:03:08,384 --> 01:03:09,510
还差六万
150,000. Still 60,000 short.

1434
01:03:09,719 --> 01:03:11,050
谁帮帮忙，还差六万
Can anyone help out? Another 60,000.

1435

Can anyone help out? Another 60,000.

1436
01:03:14,857 --> 01:03:17,257
你的药刚刚吃完了，医生说
You've just finished your medicine.

1437
01:03:17,460 --> 01:03:19,189
一定要买药回来吃才行啊！
The doctor says you need to get some more.

1438
01:03:20,496 --> 01:03:23,294
帮帮忙，还差六万块
Please help. We still need 60,000.

1439
01:03:25,201 --> 01:03:28,967
八姑，八姑，我老婆去收钱去了
Pat Koo, my wife's gone to collect money.

1440
01:03:29,172 --> 01:03:30,764
你再等两个钟头怎么样？
How about waiting another couple of hours?

1441
01:03:31,641 --> 01:03:34,007
就有六万块，你这个死人头
Who has 60,000, you dmaned idiot?

1442
01:03:34,210 --> 01:03:35,768
洗衣服能洗得了多少钱
How much can you make washing clothes?

1443
01:03:35,978 --> 01:03:37,036
你别在骗人了你
Don't try to con people.

1444
01:03:38,381 --> 01:03:40,281
够不够，不够给我滚
Is it enough? If not, out you go!

1445
01:03:42,385 --> 01:03:43,010
你们还有吗？
Have you got any?

1446
01:03:43,219 --> 01:03:45,483
没有了，你呢？   我也没有了
No? You? -I don't have any either.

1447
01:04:12,181 --> 01:04:14,445
我还是走了好
I suppose I'd better go.

1448
01:04:15,084 --> 01:04:17,780
不要再连累你们了
I don't want to trouble you anymore.

1449
01:04:44,914 --> 01:04:49,248
爷爷…
Gramps...

1450
01:05:02,565 --> 01:05:08,026
小福，爷爷赶明有空再回来看你
Little Fook, as long as Gramps is free,

1451
01:05:09,472 --> 01:05:11,838
乖乖的听妈的话
I'll come back to see you. Be good!

1452
01:05:15,845 --> 01:05:17,745
我要爷爷
I want Gramps!

1453
01:05:19,515 --> 01:05:20,777
杨伯
Uncle Yeung.

1454
01:05:21,284 --> 01:05:23,252
我走了
I'd better go.

1455
01:05:29,025 --> 01:05:30,083
杨伯，你先别走
Uncle Yeung, don't go.

1456
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:40,592
杨伯，我这儿有六万块钱
Uncle Yeung, I've got 60,000 here.

1457
01:05:40,803 --> 01:05:41,929
你先拿去交租吧
use it to pay your rent.

1458
01:05:43,306 --> 01:05:44,898
不，韩先生
No, Mr Han.

1459
01:05:45,441 --> 01:05:48,604
我知道你这些钱是用来买药的
I know you need it for medicine.

1460
01:05:48,811 --> 01:05:50,608
你还是留着吧
Keep it for yourself.

1461
01:05:51,514 --> 01:05:54,847
杨伯，你把钱先拿去交租吧
Uncle Yeung, take it for your rent.

1462
01:05:55,051 --> 01:05:56,951
今天晚上我叫阿福到街上去借钱
I'll ask Ah fook to borrow some money tonight

1463
01:05:57,153 --> 01:05:58,142
还给韩先生

1464
01:05:58,587 --> 01:06:00,521
对啊，杨伯，你先拿着吧
That's right, Uncle Yeung. You take it.

1465
01:06:00,923 --> 01:06:02,390
顶多我们再到别处借吧
We can always borrow some more later.

1466
01:06:02,591 --> 01:06:03,455
是呀

1467
01:06:03,659 --> 01:06:05,320
对呀
That's right.

1468
01:06:05,728 --> 01:06:08,697
杨伯，先拿着吧，拿着吧
Take it, Uncle Yeung.

1469
01:06:11,567 --> 01:06:12,727
谢谢…韩先生，谢谢…
Thank you, Mr. Han. Thank you.

1470
01:06:12,935 --> 01:06:16,200
不要客气，这个年头你不帮我
Don't mention it. How will we live

1471
01:06:16,405 --> 01:06:18,430
我不帮你，这日子怎么过？
if we don't help each other?

1472
01:06:18,641 --> 01:06:19,665
来，交给我
Here, give it to me.

1473
01:06:21,644 --> 01:06:23,441
八姑，这儿是二十一万
Pat Koo, here's 210,000.

1474
01:06:23,646 --> 01:06:24,374
那你自己数一数
You better count it.

1475
01:06:24,580 --> 01:06:25,478
我没空跟你数
I don't have time to count it for you.

1476
01:06:25,915 --> 01:06:28,509
我们帮杨伯把东西搬进去，来！
Let's help Uncle Yeung move back in.

1477
01:06:31,187 --> 01:06:34,520
真是谢谢大家，谢谢…
Thanks, everyone, Thank you so much!

1478
01:06:38,561 --> 01:06:41,029
八姑，这里也值二十一万的
Pat Koo, all this is worth 210,000 too.

1479
01:06:41,230 --> 01:06:43,255
记着拿回去，别再说钱不够
Don't forget it! Don't say it's not enough!

1480
01:06:44,934 --> 01:06:45,958
好了，我们走吧
OK, let's go.

1481
01:06:46,969 --> 01:06:49,062
没事了，走吧
Everything's fine, let's go.

1482
01:06:51,741 --> 01:06:54,403
好，我找三六九报复你这堕落鸡
I'll get 369 to sort you out, you whore!

1483
01:07:03,085 --> 01:07:04,245
你，过来！
You! Come here!

1484
01:07:07,189 --> 01:07:08,349
你先生姓韩
Isn't your husband's name Han Yi-Shi?

1485
01:07:08,557 --> 01:07:09,922
叫韩一世对不对？
Isn't your husband's name Han Yi-Shi?

1486
01:07:10,126 --> 01:07:11,787
对呀，什么事？
Yes. What's the matter?

1487
01:07:11,994 --> 01:07:12,892
韩一世
Han Yi-Shi.

1488
01:07:16,966 --> 01:07:18,024
有没有牌？查牌
You got a licence? I want to check.

1489
01:07:18,501 --> 01:07:19,297
查什么牌？
What license?

1490
01:07:19,902 --> 01:07:22,234
你以为我不知道，你是做舞女的
You think I don't know you're a hostess?

1491
01:07:22,438 --> 01:07:23,996
舞女时常兼做私娼
Hostesses usually moonlight as prostitutes,

1492
01:07:24,206 --> 01:07:25,434
私娼就是野鸡
and unlicensed prostitutes are against the law.

1493
01:07:25,641 --> 01:07:27,734
野鸡是犯法的，跟我到警察局
Come with me to the police station!

1494
01:07:28,878 --> 01:07:30,607
三六九，你动手动脚的干什么？
369, What are you doing here?

1495
01:07:30,813 --> 01:07:31,302
抓野鸡
Arresting an unlicensed whore.

1496
01:07:31,614 --> 01:07:32,546
你怎么知道她是野鸡？
How do you know she's a whore?

1497
01:07:33,215 --> 01:07:34,682
这还用问，你看她
Do you have to ask? Just look at her!

1498
01:07:34,884 --> 01:07:36,784
天黑的时候擦胭脂抹粉
All tarted up at this hour,

1499
01:07:36,986 --> 01:07:38,044
打扮得特别漂亮
wandering around the streets,

1500
01:07:38,254 --> 01:07:39,585
四处乱逛，还会是好人吗？
how could she be an honest woman?

1501
01:07:40,856 --> 01:07:43,620
你觉得她漂亮吗？不见得
You reckon she's pretty? I don't think so.

1502
01:07:43,959 --> 01:07:45,426
我觉得你老婆比她漂亮
I think your wife's prettier.

1503
01:07:46,429 --> 01:07:47,293
你认识我老婆？
You know my wife?

1504
01:07:47,496 --> 01:07:49,521
认识，挺风骚的     对…
Sure! She's real hot. -That's right!

1505
01:07:50,366 --> 01:07:53,267
你老婆也是天黑时候擦胭脂抹粉
Your wife dressed up in the evening too,

1506
01:07:53,469 --> 01:07:55,835
打扮得特别漂亮，四处乱逛
wandering around, looking great,

1507
01:07:56,605 --> 01:07:59,836
个子高高大大的，线条特别的…
She's tall, right? With great figure.

1508
01:08:00,242 --> 01:08:01,470
你老婆有牌吗？
Does your wife have a licence?

1509
01:08:02,511 --> 01:08:04,479
有我顶着还用领牌
She's got me, she doesn't need a licence.

1510
01:08:04,980 --> 01:08:05,878
有空来关照一下吧
Drop in to see us when you have time.

1511
01:08:07,349 --> 01:08:07,815
该死的
Dammit!

1512
01:08:08,017 --> 01:08:09,314
我怎么把这种丑事说出来
How could I have blurted this out!

1513
01:08:10,486 --> 01:08:11,350
三六九
369...

1514
01:08:13,155 --> 01:08:15,623
你老婆就是没有牌做野鸡
your wife's an unlicenced whore.

1515
01:08:15,825 --> 01:08:16,723
回去抓她吧
Go arrest her!

1516
01:08:17,059 --> 01:08:17,753
你这混账东西
You son of a bitch!

1517
01:08:17,960 --> 01:08:19,484
现在是我查她还是你查我？
Am I checking her or are you checking me?

1518
01:08:19,695 --> 01:08:20,389
走开
Get lost!

1519
01:08:21,630 --> 01:08:23,825
告诉我，你先生多大？
Tell me, how old's your husband?

1520
01:08:24,500 --> 01:08:25,023
什么事？
What for?

1521
01:08:25,234 --> 01:08:26,826
抽壮丁
The draft.

1522
01:08:27,036 --> 01:08:27,900
千万别抽他
Please don't pick him!

1523
01:08:28,104 --> 01:08:30,595
我先生有病，求求你帮帮忙吧
He's not well. Please!

1524
01:08:31,173 --> 01:08:33,641
好吧，那么还是老价钱吧
OK then. Same old price.

1525
01:08:35,811 --> 01:08:37,301
你…     五斗米
You... -5 pecks of rice.

1526
01:08:38,881 --> 01:08:40,075
我哪有五斗米？
Where would I get 5 pecks of rice?

1527
01:08:40,282 --> 01:08:40,611
你没有呀…
Do you have it or not?

1528
01:08:40,816 --> 01:08:42,943
夏季大减价三斗米
Summer discount, 3 pecks.

1529
01:08:43,919 --> 01:08:44,977
三斗也没有
I don't have 3 pecks either.

1530
01:08:45,187 --> 01:08:45,983
这样好吧
OK, let's do this.

1531
01:08:46,422 --> 01:08:47,411
大家都是朋友
We're all friends here.

1532
01:08:47,623 --> 01:08:49,352
给三块大头用用
I'll settle for 3 HK dollars.

1533
01:08:50,059 --> 01:08:51,720
我皮包里头那有这么多？
How would I have that much in my purse?

1534
01:08:52,027 --> 01:08:52,721
干干脆脆
Let's cut the bull. One dollar!

1535
01:08:52,928 --> 01:08:54,896
一块钱
Let's cut the bull. One dollar!

1536
01:08:59,668 --> 01:09:00,896
原来你比我还熟
You're more familiar with this than I am!

1537
01:09:01,103 --> 01:09:01,933
我这份你干了算吧
Why don't you have my job?

1538
01:09:02,138 --> 01:09:03,628
赚到钱我们两人分
We'll split the money.

1539
01:09:04,240 --> 01:09:05,332
谁要干你这一行呀！
Who wants to do what yu do?

1540
01:09:06,208 --> 01:09:07,539
韩师母，不要怕
Don't be scared, Mrs Han.

1541
01:09:07,743 --> 01:09:10,177
这种人能欺负就欺负，能抢就抢
These people only prey on the weak.

1542
01:09:10,379 --> 01:09:12,040
不理他就没事，上班去吧
Just ignore him. Go to work.

1543
01:09:12,248 --> 01:09:13,180
谢谢福哥
Thanks, Brother Fook.

1544
01:09:13,549 --> 01:09:15,540
三六九，你别那么凶好不好
369, don't you go too far.

1545
01:09:15,851 --> 01:09:17,113
这个世界还有法律的
There are still laws in the world.

1546
01:09:17,319 --> 01:09:19,787
公道自在人心，你斗不过我们的
Justice is in men's hearts. You can't win!

1547
01:09:22,558 --> 01:09:23,718
又栽了…
Foiled again!

1548
01:09:23,926 --> 01:09:26,690
你真是没有用的，每次让你出马
You're useless!

1549
01:09:26,896 --> 01:09:28,261
没有一次是很顺利的
You never do anything right!

1550
01:09:28,464 --> 01:09:29,362
都是拖泥带水
Always messing things up!

1551
01:09:30,432 --> 01:09:32,093
又有什么办法
What can I do?

1552
01:09:32,635 --> 01:09:33,567
那个痨病鬼
Even that consumptive guy

1553
01:09:33,769 --> 01:09:36,067
连他自己看病的钱都拿了出来了
gave away his own medicine money.

1554
01:09:37,006 --> 01:09:39,531
三六九，每次叫你去对付人
Every time I ask you to sort someone out,

1555
01:09:39,742 --> 01:09:40,902
没有一次是痛痛快快的
you always make a mess of things!

1556
01:09:41,110 --> 01:09:42,805
一块钱两块钱你都要
You can't even pass up a buck or two!

1557
01:09:43,479 --> 01:09:46,448
大哥，一块两块也得抢才有啊
You won't get a buck if you pass it up!

1558
01:09:46,649 --> 01:09:47,013
是啊
Yeah!

1559
01:09:47,216 --> 01:09:47,648
你也不想想
You should stop to think:

1560
01:09:47,850 --> 01:09:49,283
现在要把楼上这帮穷人
if we get rid of these beggars upstairs,

1561
01:09:49,485 --> 01:09:50,543
统统都赶走
if we get rid of these beggars upstairs,

1562
01:09:50,753 --> 01:09:52,914
光这间屋子就值八条金子
the house alone will be worth 8 gold bars!

1563
01:09:53,289 --> 01:09:53,778
你不想一想
Try to imagine

1564
01:09:53,989 --> 01:09:55,581
我太子炳要有八条金子的话
if l, Master Bing, had 8 gold bars,

1565
01:09:55,791 --> 01:09:56,951
手指缝里漏一点给你
what benefits might trickle down to you!

1566
01:09:57,159 --> 01:09:58,091
你也不得了啊
what benefits might trickle down to you!

1567
01:10:00,029 --> 01:10:01,587
你说这么多干什么了
Why all the words and no action then?

1568
01:10:01,797 --> 01:10:02,786
还不赶快想个办法
Hurry up and think of some way

1569
01:10:02,998 --> 01:10:04,795
把这帮穷鬼都赶出去
to get rid of this lot of beggars.

1570
01:10:06,135 --> 01:10:08,899
我已经想过了，说定了就这样办
I've thought it through.

1571
01:10:09,104 --> 01:10:11,129
这幢楼里边最恶的就是发仔
Fat Chai's the toughest of the lot.

1572
01:10:11,340 --> 01:10:12,307
先拿他开刀
We'll del with him first.

1573
01:10:12,641 --> 01:10:15,132
你说得对，有什么办法？
You're right, but how?

1574
01:10:15,411 --> 01:10:16,241
有什么办法？
But how?

1575
01:10:19,381 --> 01:10:21,645
你立刻去拿几件最漂亮的旗袍
Go wrap up a few of your best cheongsams

1576
01:10:21,850 --> 01:10:23,511
然后把它包起来，放在发仔那儿
and put them at Fat Chai's place.

1577
01:10:24,053 --> 01:10:26,283
然后呢，让三六九在门口等着
369, you wait outside.

1578
01:10:26,488 --> 01:10:29,753
等发仔一回来，你就大声嚷有贼
When Fat Chai returns, you yell "thief".

1579
01:10:29,959 --> 01:10:32,985
三六九上前一搜，人赃并获
369 will conduct a search, find the loot,

1580
01:10:33,395 --> 01:10:35,158
发仔被抓到警察局去
and haul him off to the police station.

1581
01:10:36,098 --> 01:10:38,225
你真聪明了，你应该发财
You're real smart. You deserve to get rich.

1582
01:10:39,435 --> 01:10:40,697
别讲那么多了，趁发仔还没回来
Enough talk. Hurry, before Fat Chai returns.

1583
01:10:40,903 --> 01:10:42,734
赶快拿进去，快点
Go put the things on his bunk, now!

1584
01:10:45,274 --> 01:10:47,834
我说炳哥，你想的计策真绝
I say, Brother Bing, that's real dastardly!

1585
01:10:48,043 --> 01:10:48,634
绝吧
Indeed!

1586
01:10:49,511 --> 01:10:50,705
你有儿子没有？
Do you have a son?

1587
01:10:50,913 --> 01:10:51,743
没有，干什么？
No. Why?

1588
01:10:52,281 --> 01:10:55,375
俗话说得好，要是缺德事做得多
They say that too many dastardly deeds

1589
01:10:55,584 --> 01:10:56,983
会绝子绝孙的
condemn one to having no pogeny.

1590
01:10:57,186 --> 01:10:57,880
去你妈的
Go to hell!

1591
01:11:03,626 --> 01:11:04,490
发仔哥
Fat Chai!

1592
01:11:05,561 --> 01:11:06,459
老八
Ah Bing.

1593
01:11:09,898 --> 01:11:10,557
快点
Hurry!

1594
01:11:12,468 --> 01:11:13,935
赶快拿进去，快点，快点
Put it in there quickly!

1595
01:11:15,604 --> 01:11:16,901
你去把风，我在那儿守着
You keep watch outside. I'll stay here

1596
01:11:29,018 --> 01:11:29,814
放好了？   放好了！
Done? -Done.

1597
01:11:31,387 --> 01:11:32,479
发仔回来了？     回来了
Finished work, Fat Chai? -Yes.

1598
01:11:32,888 --> 01:11:34,549
你现在上去，马上下来喊有贼
Go upstairs, then come down and yell "thief".

1599
01:11:38,927 --> 01:11:39,894
发仔，你收工？
Back from work, Fat Chai?

1600
01:11:40,763 --> 01:11:41,252
生意好吗？
How is business?

1601
01:11:41,997 --> 01:11:43,794
有贼呀，大家快点来呀…
Thief! Come quickly!

1602
01:11:45,100 --> 01:11:46,431
不得了，有贼…
Thief! Come quickly!

1603
01:11:46,635 --> 01:11:47,329
不得了
Thief!

1604
01:11:47,536 --> 01:11:48,025
什么事？…
What's happening?

1605
01:11:48,237 --> 01:11:49,534
我刚才在楼上找东西
I was looking for something just now

1606
01:11:49,738 --> 01:11:51,399
我发现不见了一件红旗袍
and discovered I'm missing a red cheonsam,

1607
01:11:51,607 --> 01:11:54,201
一件绿旗袍，还有一件丝棉袄
a green one, as well as a padded silk jacket.

1608
01:11:54,410 --> 01:11:56,901
这三样东西可以值一担米呀
In all, they're worth 100 catties of rice!

1609
01:11:57,112 --> 01:11:57,703
我怎么办？
What am I going to do now?

1610
01:11:57,913 --> 01:11:58,709
别动，你们别动
Hold it, all of you!

1611
01:11:58,914 --> 01:11:59,778
你叫我怎么办？
What am I going to do?

1612
01:11:59,982 --> 01:12:02,143
别急，别急，急也没有用
Calm down. There's no use getting upset.

1613
01:12:02,351 --> 01:12:04,046
慢慢的说给大家听吗
Tell us exactly what happened.

1614
01:12:04,386 --> 01:12:06,286
来来来
Come, come.

1615
01:12:06,488 --> 01:12:07,352
说给大家听听
Tell everyone.

1616
01:12:07,556 --> 01:12:08,545
来来来，大家听听
Come, let's all hear it.

1617
01:12:08,757 --> 01:12:10,816
我一焦急就什么都说不出来
I'm so upset I can hardly speak.

1618
01:12:12,227 --> 01:12:14,127
大家听着，八姑又丢东西了
Listen, Pat Koo's lost something again.

1619
01:12:14,330 --> 01:12:15,058
大家不要走啊
Everybody stay where you are.

1620
01:12:15,464 --> 01:12:17,728
这次要是捉到贼，一定让他坐牢
If we catch the thief, he's going to jail!

1621
01:12:19,535 --> 01:12:20,524
你先站上去
Stand up here.

1622
01:12:21,670 --> 01:12:23,069
千万别焦急，有话慢慢说
Don't fret, tell us slow and calm.

1623
01:12:23,272 --> 01:12:23,966
大家都听着呀！
Everybody listen!

1624
01:12:24,173 --> 01:12:25,697
等等，三六九     有
Wait a minute. 369! -Here!

1625
01:12:26,008 --> 01:12:26,497
有没有带手铐来？
You have your handcuffs with you?

1626
01:12:26,709 --> 01:12:28,006
带来了     准备拉人
I've got them.   Ready for an arrest.

1627
01:12:28,210 --> 01:12:28,904
准备拉人
Get ready then.

1628
01:12:29,111 --> 01:12:29,805
好，说吧
OK, tell us.

1629
01:12:31,380 --> 01:12:32,347
大家都听着啊
Everybody listen.

1630
01:12:33,549 --> 01:12:35,744
我今天下午从外边回来
I came back this afternoon and saw a man

1631
01:12:35,951 --> 01:12:36,383
看见有一个人
I came back this afternoon and saw a man

1632
01:12:36,585 --> 01:12:38,052
从楼上匆匆忙忙的下来
running down the stairs hurriedly.

1633
01:12:38,253 --> 01:12:39,550
我也觉得有点奇怪
I thought it was a bit strange.

1634
01:12:39,755 --> 01:12:42,588
没想到我跑到楼上找东西的时候
Then I went upstairs looking for something,

1635
01:12:42,791 --> 01:12:44,622
我不见了一件红旗袍
and found I was missing a red cheongsam,

1636
01:12:44,827 --> 01:12:47,159
一件绿旗袍，还有一件丝棉袄
a green one as well, and a silk jacket.

1637
01:12:47,629 --> 01:12:49,256
原来是有贼呀
I realised I'd been robbed!

1638
01:12:49,465 --> 01:12:50,159
有贼？
Robbed?

1639
01:12:50,366 --> 01:12:51,424
有没有见到那人呀？
Did you take a good look at the thief?

1640
01:12:51,633 --> 01:12:52,827
我见是没有见到
Not really, but I thought he resembled

1641
01:12:53,035 --> 01:12:54,332
不过我觉得那个人的样子
Not really, but I thought he resembled

1642
01:12:54,536 --> 01:12:57,232
有点像发仔那个死小子
that damned kid, Fat Chai!

1643
01:12:57,473 --> 01:12:58,804
你有没有搞错？
Are you sure?

1644
01:12:59,341 --> 01:13:00,865
发仔怎会偷东西？
How can Fat hai be a thief?

1645
01:13:01,443 --> 01:13:02,137
胡说
Nonsense!

1646
01:13:02,578 --> 01:13:03,169
绝对不会是发仔
It couldn't possibly be Fat Chai!

1647
01:13:03,379 --> 01:13:04,437
八姑你发神经病啊？
Pat Koo, have you gone crazy?

1648
01:13:04,780 --> 01:13:05,940
我整天在做生意怎会偷你的东西
I was working all day, how could it be me?

1649
01:13:06,148 --> 01:13:06,978
好了，好了
All right, all right.

1650
01:13:07,182 --> 01:13:09,207
发仔有没有偷也用不着吵嘛
Whether it's Fat Chai or not,

1651
01:13:09,418 --> 01:13:10,442
吵也没有用嘛
there's no need for a commotion.

1652
01:13:10,652 --> 01:13:11,243
三六九在这儿
369 is here.

1653
01:13:11,453 --> 01:13:12,613
一搜，不就清楚了吗？
A search will sort everything out.

1654
01:13:12,821 --> 01:13:15,688
好，三六九，搜
That's right. A search!

1655
01:13:20,028 --> 01:13:21,586
我问你要是搜不着你怎么说？
What if he doesn't find anything?

1656
01:13:21,797 --> 01:13:22,456
那些东西明明在里面
The stuff's definitely there.

1657
01:13:22,664 --> 01:13:23,824
怎么会搜不到？
How can he not find anything?

1658
01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:25,094
你说什么？
What did you say?

1659
01:13:25,401 --> 01:13:26,129
不…她是说
No...she simply said...

1660
01:13:26,335 --> 01:13:28,496
如果是你偷的东西一定在里边了
if you stole the stuff, it must be there.

1661
01:13:28,704 --> 01:13:29,363
好呀，好呀
OK, OK.

1662
01:13:29,571 --> 01:13:30,560
我倒不怕你们搜
I'm not afraid of any search.

1663
01:13:32,040 --> 01:13:33,735
别吵，别吵
Quiet! Quiet!

1664
01:13:33,942 --> 01:13:34,772
如果搜不到怎么说？
But what if he finds nothing?

1665
01:13:35,110 --> 01:13:36,236
你不说明我不会让你搜的
Unless that's clear, there'll be no search.

1666
01:13:36,545 --> 01:13:37,705
你先说明白，我才让你搜
Unless that's clear, there'll be no search.

1667
01:13:38,113 --> 01:13:39,944
一定搜得到，你怕什么？
He'll find it. What are you afraid f?

1668
01:13:40,215 --> 01:13:41,239
我不是怕，没什么可怕的
I'm not afraid. I've nothing to be afraid of.

1669
01:13:42,918 --> 01:13:44,852
你听我说，发仔说的对
Listen to me. Fat Chai's right.

1670
01:13:45,053 --> 01:13:46,042
有赏有罚嘛
We must have reward as well as punishment.

1671
01:13:46,355 --> 01:13:48,516
不然的话，很容易冤枉好人
Otherwise, the innocent will suffer.

1672
01:13:48,724 --> 01:13:49,782
你们说对不对？
Don't you agree?

1673
01:13:49,992 --> 01:13:52,460
对对…
That's right.

1674
01:13:58,066 --> 01:13:58,395
说明白了
Lets clear the whole thing up.

1675
01:13:58,600 --> 01:13:59,294
多余的
Lets clear the whole thing up.

1676
01:13:59,501 --> 01:14:00,399
好啦，好啦，大家听着
Alright, alright. Listen, everybody.

1677
01:14:00,836 --> 01:14:03,202
如果我在里面搜不到那些东西
If I don't find the stuff in there,

1678
01:14:03,405 --> 01:14:05,669
我、八姑、三六九我们三个人
then Pat Koo, 369, and I will kneel down

1679
01:14:05,874 --> 01:14:08,968
即刻跪在地下向发仔磕三个响头
and kowtow 3 times to Fat Chai.

1680
01:14:14,249 --> 01:14:16,444
大家听着，他们搜不到东西来
You heard it. If they find nothing,

1681
01:14:16,652 --> 01:14:18,313
三个给我磕三个响头
the'll kowtow to me 3 times!

1682
01:14:19,221 --> 01:14:20,688
太子炳，你小心点
Master Bing, be warned.

1683
01:14:21,356 --> 01:14:22,414
我是不会放过你的
I'm not letting this go.

1684
01:14:22,624 --> 01:14:23,454
放心
Relax.

1685
01:14:27,796 --> 01:14:30,458
你看清楚啊，三六九，搜！
Be vigilant, 369. Go!

1686
01:14:48,817 --> 01:14:51,411
在哪儿？     籘箱
Where's the stuff? -Rattan basket...

1687
01:14:58,861 --> 01:14:59,885
籘箱子
Rattan basket.

1688
01:15:01,864 --> 01:15:02,353
阿炳
Ah Bing,

1689
01:15:02,564 --> 01:15:04,259
我看发仔这次一定要坐牢了
Fat Chai's going to jail for sure.

1690
01:15:04,633 --> 01:15:05,565
我们不如写张招租
Why don't we put up a notice now

1691
01:15:05,767 --> 01:15:07,394
把发仔的那个床位给租出去
to let out his bunk space?

1692
01:15:07,970 --> 01:15:08,994
你想啊？
You'd like to, wouldn't you?

1693
01:15:10,105 --> 01:15:11,402
不过用不着那么急
But there's no need to jump the gun.

1694
01:15:11,707 --> 01:15:13,766
等把那个包袱搜出来后也不迟
Wait till 369 finds the bundle of clothes.

1695
01:15:19,147 --> 01:15:21,012
八姑，你到底搁在哪里啊？
Pat Koo, where did you put the stuf?

1696
01:15:23,418 --> 01:15:24,112
他说什么？
What did he say?

1697
01:15:24,686 --> 01:15:26,051
没什么，他说搜了一半
Nothing, he said he's half done.

1698
01:15:26,255 --> 01:15:27,119
还有一半没有搜
Another half to go.

1699
01:15:30,025 --> 01:15:32,186
你这死人头，这样你都搜不到
Damned idiot! Can't even search right!

1700
01:15:32,394 --> 01:15:34,862
整张床位，只有一个破籘箱子嘛
There's only one basket on the bunk!

1701
01:15:36,598 --> 01:15:38,088
可是籘箱子里面没有哇
But there's nothing in the basket!

1702
01:15:40,168 --> 01:15:41,430
三六九，你怎么这么笨呀
369, how can you be so stupid?

1703
01:15:47,476 --> 01:15:48,534
真是莫名奇妙
I can't understand it!

1704
01:15:48,744 --> 01:15:50,006
我明明放在这里边的
I put it here myself!

1705
01:15:50,345 --> 01:15:51,676
你说什么？     不是
What did you say? -Nothing!

1706
01:15:52,014 --> 01:15:53,481
她以为是你把东西放在这里
She thought you put the stuff here.

1707
01:15:53,815 --> 01:15:54,406
你…
You...

1708
01:15:58,020 --> 01:15:58,543
你有没有弄错
Can you be mistaken?

1709
01:15:59,021 --> 01:15:59,953
你不是说亲自放在里边
Didn't you say you put it here yourself?

1710
01:16:00,155 --> 01:16:00,678
我怎么会弄错
How could I have got it wrong?

1711
01:16:00,889 --> 01:16:02,220
我明明是放在里面的
I definitely put it here!

1712
01:16:03,292 --> 01:16:04,691
三六九，不管三七二十一
369, forget it.

1713
01:16:04,893 --> 01:16:05,917
把他拉到警察局去
Just haul him off to the police station.

1714
01:16:06,128 --> 01:16:07,595
无赃无证，怎么能告他呢
Without proof, how can I charge him?

1715
01:16:08,797 --> 01:16:10,697
你就说下午他拿东西去卖了嘛
Just say he sold off the loot this afternoon.

1716
01:16:11,466 --> 01:16:13,934
你真够毒的了，难怪你没有儿子
That's wicked! No wonder you have no son!

1717
01:16:14,436 --> 01:16:15,095
发仔
Fat Chai!

1718
01:16:16,405 --> 01:16:18,498
我现在才明白为什么找不到赃物
I realise why I can't find the loot.

1719
01:16:18,907 --> 01:16:20,932
你一定是下午把东西拿去卖了
You must have sold it off this afternoon.

1720
01:16:21,143 --> 01:16:22,667
你胡说！     别动！
Ridiculous! -Don't move!

1721
01:16:24,613 --> 01:16:25,807
我一进到这里来
As soon as I saw you

1722
01:16:26,014 --> 01:16:28,278
就看出你这小子根本不是好人
I knew you were no good.

1723
01:16:28,483 --> 01:16:29,211
跟我到警局去！
Come with me to the station!

1724
01:16:32,120 --> 01:16:33,519
别吵
Quiet!

1725
01:16:33,722 --> 01:16:36,714
想我不拉他，除非他把旗袍拿出来
I won't let him go. Where's the loot?

1726
01:16:37,192 --> 01:16:38,159
把旗袍拿出来吧
Hand over the cheongsams!

1727
01:16:38,360 --> 01:16:39,088
三六九先生，三六九先生
Mr 369, Mr 369!

1728
01:16:39,294 --> 01:16:40,124
拿出来
Hand it over!

1729
01:16:40,329 --> 01:16:41,887
那些衣服没有丢啊，全都在这儿
The clothes aren't stolen, they're all here.

1730
01:16:44,433 --> 01:16:45,764
你这个死丫头
You damned girl!

1731
01:16:47,269 --> 01:16:48,031
打死你
I'll kill you!

1732
01:16:48,337 --> 01:16:51,272
红的、绿的，还有丝棉袄
The red one, the green, and the silk jacket.

1733
01:16:51,840 --> 01:16:53,967
衣服全在这儿，你们全看见了
They're all here, as you can all see.

1734
01:16:54,743 --> 01:16:55,539
你们三个跪下
You three, on your knees!

1735
01:16:56,111 --> 01:16:57,840
跪下
On your knees!

1736
01:17:00,315 --> 01:17:03,148
什么？你把阿香卖给我们做导游
What? You want to sell us Ah Heung?

1737
01:17:03,485 --> 01:17:04,213
是呀
Yes.

1738
01:17:04,419 --> 01:17:05,784
我不服这口气，妈的
I can't stand her anymore, dammit!

1739
01:17:06,221 --> 01:17:07,483
那个死丫头，吃里扒外
That bloody girl has no family loyalty,

1740
01:17:07,856 --> 01:17:09,118
帮着那个臭小子
always taking the side of that damned kid.

1741
01:17:09,858 --> 01:17:10,722
八姑
Pat Koo,

1742
01:17:10,926 --> 01:17:13,258
你要把阿香卖给我们不值钱呐
she's not worth much to us.

1743
01:17:14,630 --> 01:17:16,530
老八，如果价钱不合适就别卖了
If the price's not right, we won't sell.

1744
01:17:16,832 --> 01:17:18,231
去你的！你当然不想卖了
Damn you! Of course you don't want to sell!

1745
01:17:18,433 --> 01:17:19,798
你想留着自己用了
You want to keep her for yourself!

1746
01:17:20,535 --> 01:17:23,265
我才不管，十块也好，二十块也好
I don't care if it's $10 or $20,

1747
01:17:23,472 --> 01:17:25,963
反正我非把她卖掉不可
I'm selling her for sure!

1748
01:17:26,174 --> 01:17:27,801
等一等…
Wait a minute.

1749
01:17:28,810 --> 01:17:29,538
吓死我了
You're scaring me!

1750
01:17:29,745 --> 01:17:30,507
我现在给你搭上一条线
I've found you a good connection.

1751
01:17:30,712 --> 01:17:31,610
干什么啊？三六九
What is it, 369?

1752
01:17:31,813 --> 01:17:33,747
来        拉拉扯扯的干嘛
Come! - Stop pulling! What's the matter?

1753
01:17:34,383 --> 01:17:35,680
我一回到分局子里
As soon as I got back to the station house,

1754
01:17:35,884 --> 01:17:38,546
就听见分局长嚷着要娶七姨太太
I heard the Chief wants a 7th wife,

1755
01:17:38,754 --> 01:17:40,585
声明要十七岁至十八岁
specifically between the ages of 1 7 and 1 8,

1756
01:17:40,789 --> 01:17:42,780
我一想就想起阿香来了
so I imediately thought of Ah Heung.

1757
01:17:42,991 --> 01:17:43,958
你有没有搞错
You must be joking!

1758
01:17:44,426 --> 01:17:46,519
你们分局长有六十多岁了
Your police chief's over 60 years old!

1759
01:17:47,229 --> 01:17:48,628
八十岁都要娶
He'll still want it when he's 80.

1760
01:17:49,264 --> 01:17:51,732
鬼叫他六个老婆蛋都没生一个
None of his 6 wives has had a child.

1761
01:17:52,534 --> 01:17:55,264
老八，分局长立妾等于是徵用吗
Marriage to the chief is like the draft:

1762
01:17:55,470 --> 01:17:56,528
不但没有聘礼
he offers no betrothal gifts,

1763
01:17:56,738 --> 01:17:59,104
连嫁妆你都要赔进去
so you lose out on the dowry!

1764
01:17:59,675 --> 01:18:00,198
炳哥
And you call yourself a man of the world!

1765
01:18:00,409 --> 01:18:02,274
真难为你在外面混了这么久
And you call yourself a man of the world!

1766
01:18:02,477 --> 01:18:03,637
嫁个女儿给分局长
If your daughter marries a Police Chief,

1767
01:18:03,845 --> 01:18:05,335
还在乎那点礼金，是不是？
what do you care about betrothal gifts!

1768
01:18:06,014 --> 01:18:07,208
你嫁个女儿给分局长
If your daughter marries the Police Chief,

1769
01:18:07,416 --> 01:18:08,815
分局长就是你的女婿
he'll be your son-in-law.

1770
01:18:09,017 --> 01:18:10,075
将来的好处怎么样
Think of the advantages that'll bring!

1771
01:18:10,285 --> 01:18:12,879
你自己去想想好了，想想！
Just think it over!

1772
01:18:14,289 --> 01:18:17,850
八姑，这次三六九说得对
Pat Koo, 369's right for a change.

1773
01:18:18,060 --> 01:18:20,858
到时候别说赶尽七十二家房客
Never mind evicting your 72 tenants,

1774
01:18:21,063 --> 01:18:23,497
就算赶尽全区也没有人敢说话
you can evict the whole district!

1775
01:18:23,699 --> 01:18:25,860
怎么会，全城赶尽都行的
Evict the whole city, even!

1776
01:18:26,168 --> 01:18:26,862
那也不好
No, that wouldn't do.

1777
01:18:27,069 --> 01:18:28,696
如果把全城的人都赶走了
If I got rid of everyone in the city,

1778
01:18:28,904 --> 01:18:30,201
就剩我们几个人
there'd just be the few of us left.

1779
01:18:30,405 --> 01:18:31,167
那又太冷清了
It'd be too quiet and lonely.

1780
01:18:31,373 --> 01:18:32,738
说的是呀！    是呀！
You have a point. -Yes.

1781
01:18:34,142 --> 01:18:36,406
三六九，如果这件事成功了
369, if this thing works out,

1782
01:18:36,611 --> 01:18:39,444
我一定送你两条大肥猪作为谢聘
I'll reward you two nice plump pigs.

1783
01:18:39,881 --> 01:18:42,372
两条大肥猪，油腻太重了吧
Two pigs? That's a bit heavy.

1784
01:18:42,918 --> 01:18:44,112
肥猪我是不要啦
You can keep the pigs.

1785
01:18:44,319 --> 01:18:46,480
最要紧的是你叫分局长
Just make sure you ask the Chief

1786
01:18:46,688 --> 01:18:49,088
替我多挂几条杠就行啦
to put a few stripes on my arm.

1787
01:18:50,025 --> 01:18:50,821
别说挂几条
Only a few?

1788
01:18:51,026 --> 01:18:52,084
就是挂满了也没问题
You can have an arm full of them!

1789
01:18:53,962 --> 01:18:55,190
那你准备办喜事吧
Then you should go make preparations.

1790
01:19:00,268 --> 01:19:01,860
真是太缺德
How disgraceful!

1791
01:19:03,071 --> 01:19:04,538
把个十九岁的女孩子
Marrying off a 1 9-year-old girl

1792
01:19:04,740 --> 01:19:06,264
嫁给一个六十几岁的老头子
to a 60-year-old man!

1793
01:19:07,142 --> 01:19:08,439
谁想出这种主意
Whoever came up with that idea

1794
01:19:08,643 --> 01:19:09,667
生个儿子也没有屁呀
deserves to have a son with no rear end!

1795
01:19:10,011 --> 01:19:11,774
他就是生没屁孩子都生不出来
No rear end? He doesn't deserve a son at all!

1796
01:19:12,180 --> 01:19:14,273
如果他能生的话我都生了十个
If he can have a son, I should have 10!

1797
01:19:14,616 --> 01:19:15,913
阿香以后的日子怎样过？
What kind of life will it be for Ah Heung?

1798
01:19:18,153 --> 01:19:20,383
爸爸，小福硬要我带他去买东西去
Dad, Little Fook wants me to buy him sweets.

1799
01:19:20,756 --> 01:19:21,620
好了，好了，别吵了
Okay, settle down.

1800
01:19:21,823 --> 01:19:23,256
抱他出去玩玩，快去，快去
Take him outside to paly. Go.

1801
01:19:24,126 --> 01:19:24,649
阿福哥
Brother Fook.

1802
01:19:24,860 --> 01:19:25,622
福哥，回来了？
You're back, Brother Fook?

1803
01:19:25,961 --> 01:19:27,428
阿香怎么了，发仔呢？
How's Ah Heung? Where's Fat Chai?

1804
01:19:28,196 --> 01:19:29,424
发仔在楼上陪阿香
Fat Chai's gone up to see Ah Heung.

1805
01:19:31,633 --> 01:19:33,032
你们这班臭要饭的
You stinking beggars!

1806
01:19:33,235 --> 01:19:34,497
吱吱喳喳地说我什么？
What are you jabbering about?

1807
01:19:35,604 --> 01:19:39,540
你快说，你们这群王八蛋
Tell me, you sons of bitches!

1808
01:19:41,476 --> 01:19:43,706
今天是我嫁女儿的好日子
You know it's my daughter's wedding day.

1809
01:19:44,112 --> 01:19:45,841
你们为什么不来给我道喜？
Why don't you come to congratulate me?

1810
01:19:46,047 --> 01:19:46,741
你们都死了？
One would think you'd all died!

1811
01:19:47,249 --> 01:19:50,082
八姑，你嫁女都没分钱给我们
They've all gone out to make a living.

1812
01:19:50,285 --> 01:19:51,616
他们出去赚钱吃饭嘛
It's not like you're giving out bridal money.

1813
01:19:53,588 --> 01:19:56,853
你们全都站在这干什么？想害我
So why are you all here? To plot against me?

1814
01:19:59,394 --> 01:20:00,827
八姑，你猜错了
Pat Koo, you've got us wrong.

1815
01:20:01,329 --> 01:20:03,456
我们正在商量送东西给你
We're discussing what presents to give.

1816
01:20:06,501 --> 01:20:08,469
上海婆要送一张大床
Shanghai Po's giving you a bed.

1817
01:20:09,538 --> 01:20:12,507
我呢，准备送一张红木梳妆台
I'm going to give you a chest of drawers.

1818
01:20:12,908 --> 01:20:13,704
梳妆台？
A chest of drawers!

1819
01:20:15,043 --> 01:20:18,672
陈嫂准备送一打旗袍，是给你的
Mrs Chan's a dozen cheongsams just for you,

1820
01:20:19,114 --> 01:20:21,514
不是给阿香，因为你嫁女儿吗？
since you're giving away your daughter.

1821
01:20:23,218 --> 01:20:25,516
陈嫂，你要记住腰做小点
Remember to make the waist a bit tighter,

1822
01:20:25,720 --> 01:20:26,982
叉开高点
and the slit higher!

1823
01:20:31,526 --> 01:20:32,458
还有啊
There's more.

1824
01:20:33,195 --> 01:20:34,685
金医生跟韩师母
Dr Kim, the Hans,

1825
01:20:34,896 --> 01:20:36,090
还有他们几个邻居
and a few other neighbors

1826
01:20:36,298 --> 01:20:39,096
合伙打条三斤重的金链送给你
are ordering a 3-catty gold chain for you.

1827
01:20:40,535 --> 01:20:42,526
金医生，让你破费了
Dr Kim, what an extravagance!

1828
01:20:43,438 --> 01:20:44,564
这是不好意思
I don't know what to say.

1829
01:20:44,873 --> 01:20:47,433
阿福，你们要送礼就早一点送
Ah Fook, you must bring the gifts early,

1830
01:20:47,642 --> 01:20:49,735
我呢，好跟你们准备酒席
I've got to prepare a banquet for you.

1831
01:20:50,412 --> 01:20:51,401
那可不必啦
Oh, that's not necessary.

1832
01:20:52,113 --> 01:20:53,740
那多不好意思
Of course it is.

1833
01:20:53,949 --> 01:20:55,473
你们都送那么重的礼
You're giving me so many gifts,

1834
01:20:55,684 --> 01:20:57,049
不请不好意思
how can I not invite you?

1835
01:20:58,253 --> 01:20:59,220
你听我说嘛
But I haven't finished.

1836
01:20:59,921 --> 01:21:01,889
我的橄榄今天又没有卖光
I didn't sell all my olives today,

1837
01:21:02,357 --> 01:21:04,222
金医生今天又没有生意
Dr Kim saw no patients,

1838
01:21:04,626 --> 01:21:06,526
我们街上又捡不到钱
and we didn't find money on the street.

1839
01:21:06,895 --> 01:21:08,954
所以嘛…这个…
So...

1840
01:21:10,599 --> 01:21:11,293
说什么？
What are you saying?

1841
01:21:11,900 --> 01:21:13,800
所以我们想过还是不送了
So we can't give you anything!

1842
01:21:14,002 --> 01:21:14,832
去你的
Damn you!

1843
01:21:18,974 --> 01:21:21,033
你们这班的臭东西
You stinking beggars!

1844
01:21:21,243 --> 01:21:23,871
大伙儿合起来戏弄我，你们想死
Ganging up to make a fool of me!

1845
01:21:24,880 --> 01:21:28,179
好，等我女儿三朝回门那天
Wait till my daughter comes home to visit.

1846
01:21:28,383 --> 01:21:29,213
你们就知道厉害
Then you'll see!

1847
01:21:29,551 --> 01:21:31,451
八姑，是不是摆十桌酒
Pat Koo, aren't you throwing a 10-table banquet

1848
01:21:31,653 --> 01:21:32,711
请我们大家？
to which we're all invited?

1849
01:21:32,921 --> 01:21:35,355
十桌酒，吃都把你吃死呀
Ten tables? You'll all be stuffed to death!

1850
01:21:36,291 --> 01:21:37,280
酒是酒
I'll throw all right...

1851
01:21:38,326 --> 01:21:40,294
到时候你们都得给我走
I'll throw you all out!

1852
01:21:47,168 --> 01:21:48,328
发仔，阿香怎么样啦？
Fat Chai, how's Ah Heung?

1853
01:21:48,837 --> 01:21:50,566
关着窗户，我看不见她
The windows are closed. I couldn't see her.

1854
01:21:50,772 --> 01:21:52,034
就听到哭呀
But I heard her crying inside

1855
01:21:52,240 --> 01:21:54,470
我看这样吧，你赶快带阿香走吧
I think you'd best her away from here.

1856
01:21:55,076 --> 01:21:57,010
能走就好了，只怕时间来不及了
I wish I could, but it's too late.

1857
01:21:57,445 --> 01:21:58,810
老爷，老爷
Sir, sir.

1858
01:21:59,314 --> 01:22:02,181
太太，老爷，老爷
Madam. Sir.

1859
01:22:02,851 --> 01:22:04,341
来了，马上下来
Coming! Coming right down!

1860
01:22:06,388 --> 01:22:07,582
你们这班臭要饭的
You stinking beggars.

1861
01:22:07,856 --> 01:22:09,050
赶紧找地方搬家
Get ready to move out,

1862
01:22:09,457 --> 01:22:10,253
不然我就拉人
or I'll have you all arrested.

1863
01:22:11,426 --> 01:22:12,256
快点啦
Hurry up!

1864
01:22:12,694 --> 01:22:13,592
我在锁门
I must lock the door first.

1865
01:22:13,895 --> 01:22:14,759
要是让那死丫头跑掉了
If that damned girl escapes,

1866
01:22:14,963 --> 01:22:16,157
就鸡犬不宁
we'll be in trouble.

1867
01:22:18,600 --> 01:22:19,328
太太
Madam.

1868
01:22:20,402 --> 01:22:21,528
是不是分局长来了？
Has the Police Chief arrive?

1869
01:22:22,003 --> 01:22:23,903
没有，我看见局长在整理衣服
Not yet. I saw him getting ready

1870
01:22:24,105 --> 01:22:24,764
我来通知你们
and came to tell you

1871
01:22:24,973 --> 01:22:26,463
叫你们到外面去迎接他
to get ready to welcome him outside.

1872
01:22:26,675 --> 01:22:28,666
等他来了好开心一点嘛
That will certainly please him.

1873
01:22:28,877 --> 01:22:29,844
是的…走…
Yes, yes. Let's go.

1874
01:22:30,045 --> 01:22:30,670
老爷，太太
Sir. Madam.

1875
01:22:31,146 --> 01:22:32,511
等回儿见到局长女婿
When you meet your Police Chief son-in-law,

1876
01:22:32,714 --> 01:22:33,772
最要紧提一提我的杠呀
don't forget to mention my stripes!

1877
01:22:33,982 --> 01:22:35,210
你放心，整堆都有
Don't worry. You'll get a bunch of them.

1878
01:22:38,019 --> 01:22:39,987
太太请     老爷请
Madam, please. -Sir, please.

1879
01:22:41,022 --> 01:22:44,856
请，请
Please.

1880
01:22:51,666 --> 01:22:52,360
笑什么？
What's so funny?

1881
01:22:53,535 --> 01:22:54,627
笑什么？
What's so funny?

1882
01:22:56,938 --> 01:22:59,498
去…
Go on up.

1883
01:23:02,377 --> 01:23:03,742
发仔，你上去干什么？
Fat Chai, what are you going up for?

1884
01:23:04,112 --> 01:23:04,976
我上去救阿香
I'm going to save Ah Heung.

1885
01:23:05,313 --> 01:23:06,302
不要爬水管，拆楼板
Don't climb the pipes or smash floorboards.

1886
01:23:09,651 --> 01:23:12,745
阿香…     你…
Ah Heung. -It's you!

1887
01:23:13,088 --> 01:23:13,747
我带你走
I'm taking you away.

1888
01:23:15,824 --> 01:23:16,722
快
Hurry!

1889
01:23:17,592 --> 01:23:18,456
太太，我先去看着
Madam. I'm going to watch out for them.

1890
01:23:21,363 --> 01:23:22,455
快，快
Hurry!

1891
01:23:23,498 --> 01:23:25,728
阿香来了     阿香
Ah Heung's coming. -Ah Heung.

1892
01:23:26,134 --> 01:23:26,623
趁他们现在不在
Take Ah Heung away while they're gone!

1893
01:23:26,835 --> 01:23:27,665
你赶快带阿香走吧
Take Ah Heung away while they're gone!

1894
01:23:30,071 --> 01:23:31,038
我现在不能走
I can't go now!

1895
01:23:31,239 --> 01:23:32,228
我走了连累你们大家
I'll get you all into trouble!

1896
01:23:32,607 --> 01:23:33,699
你走了不关我们的事
Your going won't have anything to do with us.

1897
01:23:33,908 --> 01:23:35,876
你再不走就来不及啦，快点吧
Hurry, go before it's too late!

1898
01:23:37,145 --> 01:23:38,203
发仔，我这有点钱
Fat Chai, here's some money.

1899
01:23:38,413 --> 01:23:39,675
你赶快带阿香走吧
Take Ah Heung and go!

1900
01:23:42,317 --> 01:23:43,147
这里有些钱
Here's some money.

1901
01:23:43,351 --> 01:23:44,784
走吧，快点走
Hurry, go!

1902
01:23:45,553 --> 01:23:47,953
快点走，快走
Hurry, go!

1903
01:23:48,990 --> 01:23:49,786
你们到什么地方去？
Where are you going?

1904
01:23:50,058 --> 01:23:50,547
带阿香走呀
I'm taking Ah Heung away.

1905
01:23:50,759 --> 01:23:52,590
不能走呀，八姑已经到了巷口
You can't go. Pat Koo's already in the alley.

1906
01:23:53,628 --> 01:23:54,219
真麻烦
Dammit!

1907
01:23:54,429 --> 01:23:55,293
早不撒尿，晚不撒尿
What dreadful timing!

1908
01:23:55,497 --> 01:23:56,327
这个时候撒尿
What dreadful timing!

1909
01:23:56,631 --> 01:23:58,531
金医生，你念过那么多书
Dr Kim, you're an educated man,

1910
01:23:58,733 --> 01:24:00,963
想办法救救阿香吧     是
Can't you think of some way to help them?

1911
01:24:01,169 --> 01:24:03,433
可惜韩先生到医院排队看病去
Too bad Mr Han's queuing at the hospital,

1912
01:24:03,738 --> 01:24:04,170
要不然的话
otherwise there'd be one more person

1913
01:24:04,372 --> 01:24:06,101
可以多个人想想办法   是
To help think of what to do. -Yes.

1914
01:24:06,508 --> 01:24:07,406
排队看病？
He's queuing at the hospital?

1915
01:24:08,276 --> 01:24:10,836
有了，我有办法了
That's it! I've got an idea!

1916
01:24:12,547 --> 01:24:14,014
什么办法？
What is it?

1917
01:24:15,050 --> 01:24:15,948
慢着
Hang on.

1918
01:24:16,384 --> 01:24:18,944
上海婆…这是瓶泻药
Shanghai Po, this is a laxative.

1919
01:24:19,454 --> 01:24:21,684
等一会给八姑吃了就行了
Get Pat Koo to take it somehow.

1920
01:24:22,257 --> 01:24:24,122
阿香赶快换套男人衣服
Ah Heung, put on some men's clothes.

1921
01:24:24,325 --> 01:24:24,916
发仔
Fat Chai,

1922
01:24:25,126 --> 01:24:26,991
找张棉被把阿香包起来就行了
wrap her up in a quilt blanket.

1923
01:24:27,328 --> 01:24:27,817
包起来？
Wrap her up?

1924
01:24:28,029 --> 01:24:29,189
金医生，到底是怎么回事？
Dr Kim, what's all this about?

1925
01:24:29,798 --> 01:24:33,461
这你就不懂，来…
You don't understand. Come!

1926
01:24:35,603 --> 01:24:37,628
三六九，局长来了你在这等着
369, the Police Chief is coming. Wait here

1927
01:24:37,839 --> 01:24:38,806
我跟老八先去办事
I have something to do for Ah Pat.

1928
01:24:39,007 --> 01:24:40,304
好，你请
All right. Please.

1929
01:24:46,981 --> 01:24:49,040
救命呀！
Help!

1930
01:24:55,156 --> 01:24:57,317
他妈的，我今天嫁女儿
Damn it! It's my daughter's wedding!

1931
01:24:57,525 --> 01:24:58,583
你要动刀杀人
Are you trying to murder someone?

1932
01:24:59,027 --> 01:25:01,052
八姑，这回倒是金医生不对
Pat Koo, Dr Kim's in the wrong this time.

1933
01:25:01,262 --> 01:25:02,251
做医生的不给病人看病
A doctor can't refuse to see a patient.

1934
01:25:02,730 --> 01:25:03,958
这种病怎么能看
It's not an illness I can treat!

1935
01:25:05,767 --> 01:25:07,962
发仔发仔，你也别动刀子
Fat Chai, put down your chopper.

1936
01:25:08,670 --> 01:25:09,534
事情是这样的
It's like this.

1937
01:25:09,737 --> 01:25:11,830
昨天晚上发仔有个朋友住在这
Fat Chai had a friend stay over last night

1938
01:25:12,040 --> 01:25:13,302
今天早上觉得有点不舒服
who didn't feel well this morning,

1939
01:25:13,508 --> 01:25:14,566
就请金医生给他看看
so he went to see Dr Kim.

1940
01:25:14,776 --> 01:25:18,143
好了，好了，他死是他的事
All right, it's his funeral.

1941
01:25:18,346 --> 01:25:19,176
又不关我们的事
None of our business!

1942
01:25:19,681 --> 01:25:20,773
你快回去撒尿去吧
Go and take a leak already!

1943
01:25:21,616 --> 01:25:22,548
这话可就不对了
That's not right!

1944
01:25:22,917 --> 01:25:23,815
你知道他得了什么病吗？
Do you know what disease he's got?

1945
01:25:24,486 --> 01:25:25,976
难道得的是霍乱啊
It couldn't be cholera, could it?

1946
01:25:26,921 --> 01:25:27,683
就是霍乱
It is indeed cholera!

1947
01:25:31,292 --> 01:25:32,987
你再说一次！    是这样…
Say that again? -It's like this.

1948
01:25:34,262 --> 01:25:35,320
让我来，我告诉你
Let me tell you what happened.

1949
01:25:35,897 --> 01:25:36,989
今天早上我朋友得了病
My friend didn't feel well this morning.

1950
01:25:37,198 --> 01:25:38,290
又吐又泻又头晕
He had the runs and felt dizzy,

1951
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:40,228
我请金医生来看一看
so I took him to see Dr Kim.

1952
01:25:40,702 --> 01:25:41,999
他告诉我是霍乱
ut he told me it was cholera

1953
01:25:42,504 --> 01:25:44,472
说完他就跑了，连看都不看
and wouldn't even take a look.

1954
01:25:44,672 --> 01:25:45,502
你说有没有医德？
Doesn' he have any medical ethics?

1955
01:25:45,707 --> 01:25:48,767
可是，这种病会传染的
But this disease is contagious!

1956
01:25:49,477 --> 01:25:51,411
八姑，这事我们倒不怕
Pat Koo, that's nothing to worry about.

1957
01:25:51,613 --> 01:25:52,944
大不了进集中营，对不对
Comes to the worst, we'll just be quarantined.

1958
01:25:53,548 --> 01:25:55,243
我最担心就是警察局长到了这儿
But what if the Police Chief finds out?

1959
01:25:55,450 --> 01:25:57,145
到时候连阿香都不要了
He may not want Ah Heung anymore!

1960
01:25:57,652 --> 01:25:58,346
你想想吧
Think of something!

1961
01:25:59,220 --> 01:26:01,188
金医生
Dr Kim!

1962
01:26:01,856 --> 01:26:04,086
你这老不死的，连病人都不看
You old bastard! Refusing to treat a patient!

1963
01:26:04,292 --> 01:26:05,520
你还算是什么医生？
What kind of a doctor are you?

1964
01:26:05,927 --> 01:26:06,586
我告诉你
Let me tell you,

1965
01:26:06,794 --> 01:26:08,455
要是我的女儿嫁不出去
if my daughter's wedding falls through,

1966
01:26:08,663 --> 01:26:10,563
你看我饶不饶了你
I won't let you get away with it!

1967
01:26:11,065 --> 01:26:14,000
八姑，这件事是山东佬的不好
Pat Koo, it's all the Shantung guy's fault!

1968
01:26:14,202 --> 01:26:15,430
你也何必生那么大气
Don't upset yourself so.

1969
01:26:15,870 --> 01:26:17,098
喝点茶润润嗓子吧
Have a cup of hot tea.

1970
01:26:17,605 --> 01:26:18,537
气死我
I'm so mad!

1971
01:26:22,243 --> 01:26:24,734
上海婆，这一次你对我最好了
Shanghai Po, you're very kind this time.

1972
01:26:24,946 --> 01:26:25,878
应该的，应该的
You deserve it.

1973
01:26:26,748 --> 01:26:29,080
死山东佬，你要赶快想办法
Shantung Man, do something quickly!

1974
01:26:29,817 --> 01:26:31,808
八姑，这种病是没得救
Pat Koo, it's an incurable disease.

1975
01:26:32,020 --> 01:26:32,952
一定死的
He'll die for sure.

1976
01:26:33,321 --> 01:26:33,787
你说什么？
What are you saying?

1977
01:26:33,988 --> 01:26:35,353
这么说一定要把死尸挺在这儿
You might have to put up with a corpse here.

1978
01:26:35,757 --> 01:26:36,815
这可便宜了你，八姑？
What a stroke of luck, Pat Koo!

1979
01:26:37,025 --> 01:26:38,549
三朝回门兼做七了
You can have a wedding and a funeral!

1980
01:26:38,860 --> 01:26:42,261
去你的，你要赶快想办法
Damn you! Do something, quick!

1981
01:26:42,463 --> 01:26:44,761
要不然的话，我就宰了你
Or I'll have your hide for this!

1982
01:26:44,966 --> 01:26:45,933
八姑啊
Pat Koo.

1983
01:26:47,702 --> 01:26:50,500
救是没得救了，唯一的办法
It's too late to save him. All we can do

1984
01:26:50,705 --> 01:26:53,902
就是趁局长没来之前把他搬出去
is get rid of him before the Chief arrives.

1985
01:26:54,108 --> 01:26:56,042
不然咱们都没有办法
Otherwise we're all done for. And you, too.

1986
01:26:56,878 --> 01:27:00,006
你也是一样，肚子一痛就没救了
Once the stomach cramps start, that's it!

1987
01:27:00,215 --> 01:27:02,615
去你妈的，你咒我，真该死
To hell with you! Cursing me to die!

1988
01:27:02,817 --> 01:27:03,511
死发仔
Damn you, Fat Chai!

1989
01:27:04,953 --> 01:27:06,443
把你的朋友赶快跟我搬走
Get your friend out of here immediately.

1990
01:27:06,654 --> 01:27:09,122
你说什么，你就让他见死不救
You mean you won't help a dying man?

1991
01:27:09,324 --> 01:27:10,552
算了算了，我怕你了
Alright, alright. You win.

1992
01:27:11,326 --> 01:27:11,815
这儿有点钱
Here's some money.

1993
01:27:12,026 --> 01:27:13,755
你赶快拿去跟那个病人去看病吧
Take him to see another doctor.

1994
01:27:14,729 --> 01:27:15,127
去，去
Go! Go!

1995
01:27:15,330 --> 01:27:16,888
发仔，你还不快点带你朋友走
Fat Chai! Take your friend now and go!

1996
01:27:17,865 --> 01:27:18,832
好，我搬走
OK, I'm moving out.

1997
01:27:21,803 --> 01:27:26,900
金医生，你的这个主意出得真好
Dr Kim, that was a really good idea!

1998
01:27:27,308 --> 01:27:28,900
我们全都靠你帮忙了
We really must thank you.

1999
01:27:29,844 --> 01:27:31,311
我的主意不错？
My idea's not bad?

2000
01:27:31,512 --> 01:27:32,570
正，正
It's great!

2001
01:27:32,780 --> 01:27:36,341
让开…传人啊…让开
Make way! Make way! Contagion!

2002
01:27:37,151 --> 01:27:38,015
什么事啊？
What's the matter?

2003
01:27:39,254 --> 01:27:40,221
你可千万不能进去
Fo heaven's sake don't go in!

2004
01:27:40,421 --> 01:27:41,649
那个病鬼得的是霍乱啊
There's a cholera victim!

2005
01:27:41,856 --> 01:27:43,084
在局长没有来之前
We must move him out

2006
01:27:43,291 --> 01:27:45,225
我们一定要把他抬出去
before the Police Chief arrives.

2007
01:27:45,727 --> 01:27:46,591
我现在告诉你
But I came to tell you

2008
01:27:46,794 --> 01:27:48,819
分局长的花轿已经到了街口了
his palanquin's has just arrived outside.

2009
01:27:49,397 --> 01:27:52,491
让开！
Make way!

2010
01:27:52,867 --> 01:27:54,391
阿炳，这怎么办啊？
Ah Bing, what do we do now?

2011
01:27:56,437 --> 01:27:57,768
发仔，还不赶快把他抬进去
Fat Chai, get your friend inside quickly!

2012
01:27:58,172 --> 01:27:59,799
等会局长来了你想把他抬进花轿
Are you waiting for the Chief's palanquin?

2013
01:28:01,509 --> 01:28:04,137
抬进去…
Inside!

2014
01:28:04,345 --> 01:28:06,836
那怎么办，如果让分局长知道了
What if the Police Chief finds out?

2015
01:28:07,048 --> 01:28:08,982
我们这儿闹霍乱这事情不全完了
If he knows there's cholera here, it's over.

2016
01:28:09,951 --> 01:28:11,816
大家听着，等一会局长来了
Listen everybody. When the Chief comes,

2017
01:28:12,020 --> 01:28:13,817
任何人不许提霍乱这两个字
don't anyone mention the word cholera!

2018
01:28:14,022 --> 01:28:15,421
谁要提了，我就把他枪毙
I'll shoot anyone who does!

2019
01:28:16,291 --> 01:28:17,087
你们听见了吗？
Do I make myself clear?

2020
01:28:20,094 --> 01:28:22,858
阿炳，我不知是不是心理作用
Ah Bing, I may be imagining it,

2021
01:28:23,564 --> 01:28:25,259
我的肚子有点痛
but my stomach hurts.

2022
01:28:25,867 --> 01:28:26,799
老八
Ah Pat,

2023
01:28:27,001 --> 01:28:28,400
你不能在这时候开我的玩笑
this is no time for jokes!

2024
01:28:28,703 --> 01:28:30,170
局长到
The Police Chief!

2025
01:28:42,250 --> 01:28:43,877
敬礼！
Salute!

2026
01:28:44,218 --> 01:28:45,810
局长大人女婿
Mr Police Chief son-in-law.

2027
01:28:55,096 --> 01:28:56,085
坐
Please sit down.

2028
01:29:01,436 --> 01:29:04,166
局长大人女婿，早
Good morning. Police Chief son-in-law.

2029
01:29:05,540 --> 01:29:08,532
姑爷，老爷、太太给你请安
My greetings, Sir and Madam.

2030
01:29:11,579 --> 01:29:14,878
副官，以前那几个怎么叫的？
Officer, what did I use to call the others?

2031
01:29:16,050 --> 01:29:18,245
全都是叫爹地、妈咪
You called them Daddy and Mommy.

2032
01:29:21,189 --> 01:29:24,352
爹地、妈咪，早
Daddy, Mommy, Good morning.

2033
01:29:24,826 --> 01:29:27,351
我们姑爷向老爷太太请安
Our master greets Sir and Madam.

2034
01:29:28,162 --> 01:29:29,527
乖，乖
Good, good.

2035
01:29:29,731 --> 01:29:32,359
你看我们女婿大人多有礼貌
See how polite our son-in-law is.

2036
01:29:33,101 --> 01:29:33,863
你叫什么姐？
What's your name?

2037
01:29:34,202 --> 01:29:36,102
我，我叫阿银
I...I'm called Ah Yin.

2038
01:29:37,405 --> 01:29:38,099
阿银姐
Ah Yin,

2039
01:29:38,306 --> 01:29:40,297
陪我上楼给新娘子换衣服吧
come up with me to help the bride change.

2040
01:29:41,843 --> 01:29:42,867
请请
Please.

2041
01:29:44,379 --> 01:29:45,471
肚子痛，肚子痛
My stomach hurts!

2042
01:29:48,449 --> 01:29:51,714
老婆大人，我的肚子啊
Dear wife, my stomach hurts!

2043
01:29:51,919 --> 01:29:55,377
我…我要拉出来了
I...I can't hold it in!

2044
01:29:55,656 --> 01:29:57,055
赶快回家吧，快走
Quick, go home!

2045
01:30:03,097 --> 01:30:05,827
快走吧，快点回去，走吧
Quick, go home!

2046
01:30:09,237 --> 01:30:10,226
我肚子痛呀
My stomach hurts!

2047
01:30:10,438 --> 01:30:11,336
你怎么了？
How do you feel?

2048
01:30:11,539 --> 01:30:12,699
我要大便
I must go to the toilet.

2049
01:30:13,074 --> 01:30:14,564
你快背我，背我
Carry me. Carry me.

2050
01:30:24,252 --> 01:30:25,344
快点
Hurry!

2051
01:30:26,020 --> 01:30:28,147
什么事？到底什么事啊？
What's the matter? What's going on?

2052
01:30:29,424 --> 01:30:31,858
局长女婿大人，没事
Nothing, Police Chief son-in-law.

2053
01:30:32,059 --> 01:30:33,321
绝对没事
Absolutely nothing.

2054
01:30:36,063 --> 01:30:37,428
我…
I...

2055
01:30:43,704 --> 01:30:45,433
下来了
Coming down

2056
01:30:45,973 --> 01:30:47,873
阿炳，你把门锁着干什么
Ah Bing! Why did you lock the door?

2057
01:30:49,710 --> 01:30:52,304
老爷，会不会是那玩意啊？
Master, could it be that thing?

2058
01:30:53,748 --> 01:30:55,943
不会吧，副官     有
I hope not. Officer! -Yes Sir!

2059
01:30:57,151 --> 01:30:58,914
我限你一分钟马上答覆我
You have one minute to find out

2060
01:30:59,120 --> 01:31:00,553
这是怎么回事？     是
what's going on here. -Yes Sir.

2061
01:31:02,690 --> 01:31:05,716
老家伙     我？
Old man! -Who? Me?

2062
01:31:06,160 --> 01:31:06,990
除了你还有谁
Who else but you?

2063
01:31:09,330 --> 01:31:10,991
老家伙，我限你三十秒钟内
Old man, you have 30 seconds

2064
01:31:11,199 --> 01:31:12,564
答覆我到底这是怎么一回事？
to tell me what's going on here.

2065
01:31:13,401 --> 01:31:15,665
不能说啊，炳哥告诉我们
I can't tell you. Ah Bing told us

2066
01:31:15,870 --> 01:31:18,134
千万不能提霍乱两个字   霍乱
not to mention the word "cholera". cholera

2067
01:31:18,906 --> 01:31:19,463
霍乱？
Cholera?

2068
01:31:21,709 --> 01:31:22,607
你这个老不死的
You old bastard!

2069
01:31:22,810 --> 01:31:25,176
这谁得霍乱了？谁拉肚子啊？
Who has cholera? Who has diarrhea?

2070
01:31:25,379 --> 01:31:26,846
我…拉
I...have...

2071
01:31:30,852 --> 01:31:31,876
你这死阿炳
Damn you Ah Bing!

2072
01:31:34,288 --> 01:31:36,620
你要是机灵的就给我讲清楚
If you're smart, you'll tell the truth.

2073
01:31:37,191 --> 01:31:39,125
你要是不讲老实话
If you don't,

2074
01:31:39,327 --> 01:31:41,124
我就判你终身监禁
I'll have you imprisoned for life.

2075
01:31:41,796 --> 01:31:42,763
终身监禁
Imprisoned for life?

2076
01:31:43,531 --> 01:31:44,998
炳哥，那我不能不说了
Ah Bing, I've got to tell him.

2077
01:31:48,069 --> 01:31:49,263
站远点，站远点
Stand back, stand back.

2078
01:31:50,071 --> 01:31:51,800
站这儿可以吧   行了，你说吧
Is here all right? -Yes. Speak!

2079
01:31:52,273 --> 01:31:53,240
事情是这样的
It's like this. This morning

2080
01:31:53,441 --> 01:31:55,306
今天早晨这儿有人得霍乱
someon came down with cholera.

2081
01:31:55,877 --> 01:31:57,708
本来我们要把他搬走
We wanted to move him away

2082
01:31:57,912 --> 01:31:59,675
可是局长大人娶媳妇
but you were to become a father-in-law,

2083
01:32:00,348 --> 01:32:01,815
不，不，做新郎倌
No, no, I mean a bridegroom,

2084
01:32:02,483 --> 01:32:04,508
所以现在病人还在我房里
so the patient's still in my room.

2085
01:32:05,553 --> 01:32:06,383
三六九

2086
01:32:06,587 --> 01:32:07,918
三六九     有
369! -Yes Sir!

2087
01:32:09,724 --> 01:32:12,488
限你一分钟内把那霍乱鬼搬出去
You have 1 minute to remove the patient.

2088
01:32:12,693 --> 01:32:13,284
是
Yes Sir!

2089
01:32:17,565 --> 01:32:18,725
发仔，你去搬吧
Fat Chai, you do it.

2090
01:32:19,200 --> 01:32:20,132
你不帮忙，我一个人搬不动
I can't move him without your help.

2091
01:32:27,141 --> 01:32:29,006
小心点，病人会传染的
Careful! It's contagious!

2092
01:32:29,644 --> 01:32:32,408
看一眼都会传染的，抬脚
Don't even look. Take his legs.

2093
01:32:35,950 --> 01:32:36,746
还有
Another thing.

2094
01:32:37,318 --> 01:32:39,047
你要是觉得肚子痛就去看医生
If your stomach hurts, go see a doctor.

2095
01:32:39,253 --> 01:32:39,981
要不然会死的

2096

谢谢，谢谢你
Thank you. Thank you.

2097
01:32:42,690 --> 01:32:44,021
行了吗？   行了
Ready? -Ready.

2098
01:32:46,427 --> 01:32:47,553
发仔，有多远走多远
Fat Chai, go as far away as you can.

2099
01:32:47,895 --> 01:32:48,759
我知道了，韩师母
I know, Mrs Han.

2100
01:32:49,063 --> 01:32:49,961

2106
01:33:01,008 --> 01:33:02,475
再见了，大家再见了

2107
01:33:02,677 --> 01:33:05,475
再见了…
Goodbye.

2108
01:33:05,680 --> 01:33:06,942
发仔，你还不赶快抬出去
Fat Chai, hurry up and take him outside.

2109
01:33:07,148 --> 01:33:08,206
难道等着上花轿吗
You want to wait for the palanquin?

2110
01:33:08,516 --> 01:33:10,074
你想得倒美，再见了

2113
01:33:20,828 --> 01:33:21,385
什么事？
What's the matter?

2114
01:33:21,596 --> 01:33:22,494
局长有命令
An order from the Chief.

2115
01:33:22,697 --> 01:33:24,460
把这棉被里的东西都扔走
Throw away everything inside this blanket.

2116
01:33:24,665 --> 01:33:25,529
这个是什么东西？
What is this?

2117
01:33:25,733 --> 01:33:27,132
是不是金器、古董？
Silverware and antiques?

2118
01:33:27,668 --> 01:33:28,862
那有那么多金器、古董
How can there be so much of it?

2119
01:33:29,070 --> 01:33:30,435
这是霍乱鬼
It's a cholera victim.

2120
01:33:31,305 --> 01:33:32,203
你们究竟搬不搬啊？
Are you moving him or not?

2121
01:33:32,640 --> 01:33:34,130
不搬我就搬回去了     搬…
If not, I'll take him back. -We're moving!

2122
01:33:34,342 --> 01:33:38,711
谁说不搬哪，车，车…
Who says we're not? Pedicab!

2123
01:33:40,381 --> 01:33:41,075
叫我？
You calling me?

2124
01:33:41,515 --> 01:33:42,607
当然是叫你了
Of course I'm calling you.

2125
01:33:42,817 --> 01:33:43,806
有什么事？
What's the matter?

2126
01:33:44,151 --> 01:33:45,448
现在要徵用你的车子
We're requisitioning your cab.

2127
01:33:45,653 --> 01:33:47,177
把这个棉被和裹着的东西
Take all this as far away as possible.

2128
01:33:47,388 --> 01:33:48,013
把它拉走
Take all this as far away as possible.

2129
01:33:48,222 --> 01:33:49,052
行，给钱
Okay, but money first.

2130
01:33:49,690 --> 01:33:50,281
你这是什么话
What are you saying?

2131
01:33:50,491 --> 01:33:52,049
我们徵用你的车还要给钱
Money? We're requisitioning your cab!

2132
01:33:52,727 --> 01:33:54,558
不给钱，你凭什么不给钱
No money! Who do you think you are?

2133
01:33:55,196 --> 01:33:57,027
你少啰啰嗦嗦的
Shut up. I can charge you with obstructing

2134
01:33:57,231 --> 01:33:59,392
我随随便便的可以告你妨碍公务
a police officer in the course of his duty.

2135
01:34:00,234 --> 01:34:01,326
你这不是在欺负我吗？
Are you trying to bully me?

2136
01:34:01,636 --> 01:34:02,466
你有几个老子你？
How many fathers have you got?

2137
01:34:02,670 --> 01:34:03,967
老兄，我朋友得了霍乱
Buddy, my friend has cholera.

2138
01:34:04,171 --> 01:34:06,366
要到医院去，求你帮个忙好不好
Get us to the hospital quick, please!

2139
01:34:06,574 --> 01:34:08,405
霍乱？有病你们早说嘛
Cholera? Why didn't you say so earlier?

2140
01:34:08,743 --> 01:34:10,005
你这人真是开…
The sooner you take him...

2141
01:34:10,444 --> 01:34:11,001
要多少钱？
How much?

2142
01:34:11,212 --> 01:34:12,110
救人要什么钱
I don't charge for saving lives.

2143
01:34:12,446 --> 01:34:13,435
你以为我和他们一样
You think I'm like them?

2144
01:34:13,648 --> 01:34:15,172
等救护车来还得等半天，走吧
Can't wait for an ambulance. Let's go.

2145
01:34:16,517 --> 01:34:17,779
你胡说八道什么
What are you blabbering about?

2146
01:34:17,985 --> 01:34:19,577
你再胡说八道，我抄你的牌
Do you want me to write you a ticket?

2147
01:34:20,955 --> 01:34:23,014
他妈的，怎么那么多人恨我们？
Dammit! Why do so many people hate us?

2148
01:34:26,260 --> 01:34:27,557
阿炳，怎么样了？
Have they gone, Ah Bing?

2149
01:34:27,928 --> 01:34:28,860
我硬把他们推出去了
Yes, I got rid of them.

2150
01:34:29,697 --> 01:34:31,392
敬礼！报告局长大人
Salute! Reporting, Chief!

2151
01:34:31,599 --> 01:34:32,759
我已经徵用了一辆车
I requisitioned a pedicab

2152
01:34:32,967 --> 01:34:34,559
叫他们有多远就把他送多远
and sent them as far away as possible.

2153
01:34:36,971 --> 01:34:39,030
局长大人女婿
Police Chief son-in-law.

2154
01:34:39,240 --> 01:34:40,969
我可以叫我女儿换衣服了？
Shall I tell my daughter to get dressed now?

2155
01:34:41,175 --> 01:34:41,903
快点，快点
Hurry up!

2156
01:34:42,243 --> 01:34:43,210
我已经在大三元
I've ordered over 100 tables

2157
01:34:43,411 --> 01:34:45,402
订了一百多桌酒席
for the wedding banquet.

2158
01:34:45,880 --> 01:34:47,245
快去，快去
Hurry, hurry.

2159
01:34:52,019 --> 01:34:52,883
我们现在怎么样了？
What are we going to do now?

2160
01:34:53,187 --> 01:34:54,654
不要紧了，我们马上就到火车站
It's OK. We're almost at the train station.

2161
01:34:54,855 --> 01:34:55,514
真的？
Really?

2162
01:34:59,860 --> 01:35:03,523
阿香…
Ah Heung...

2163
01:35:06,634 --> 01:35:11,799
老八…不得了
Oh my goodness, Ah Pat!

2164
01:35:12,006 --> 01:35:12,904
你怎么了你？
What's wrong with you?

2165
01:35:13,207 --> 01:35:14,640
阿香，阿香不见了
Ah Heung's gone!

2166
01:35:15,076 --> 01:35:16,771
阿炳，你说什么？
Ah Bing, what did you just say?

2167
01:35:16,977 --> 01:35:20,174
你别吓唬我，我晕过去了
Don't scare me, I'm going to faint.

2168
01:35:21,449 --> 01:35:22,780
你可不能晕过去
You can't faint now!

2169
01:35:22,983 --> 01:35:24,143
你别开这种玩笑
If that's a joke, it's not funny!

2170
01:35:24,919 --> 01:35:27,285
我在大三元订了一百多桌酒席
I've over 100 tables of guests at the restaurant.

2171
01:35:27,922 --> 01:35:29,287

That's a lot of gifts. -I know.

2172
01:35:32,126 --> 01:35:35,857
你们这帮穷鬼有谁见过阿香？
You beggars! Has anyone seen Ah Heung?

2173
01:35:36,063 --> 01:35:36,791
我看见
I saw her.

2174
01:35:38,766 --> 01:35:39,460
在什么地方？
Where?

2175
01:35:40,534 --> 01:35:41,398
就在这儿
Right here.

2176
01:35:41,969 --> 01:35:42,560
什么时候？
When?

2177
01:35:43,003 --> 01:35:43,731
昨天晚上
Last night.

2178
01:35:44,004 --> 01:35:45,028
去你妈的
Damn you!

2179
01:35:45,673 --> 01:35:47,334
三六九   三六九
369. -369.

2180
01:35:50,544 --> 01:35:53,775
在…这儿，局…局长，什么事啊
I'm...Here. What...is it, Chief?

2181
01:35:53,981 --> 01:35:54,845
我告诉你
I'm telling you.

2182
01:35:55,182 --> 01:35:57,707
你今天不把新娘找回来
If you don't find the bride today,

2183
01:35:59,720 --> 01:36:01,449
担心你那几条杠
start worrying about your stripes.

2184
01:36:01,655 --> 01:36:03,282
我那几条杠怎么样？
What will happen to my stripes?

2185
01:36:03,891 --> 01:36:05,188
你等下辈子
You'll get them inyour next life.

2186
01:36:07,628 --> 01:36:09,653
我告诉你我知道阿香去了哪儿
I can tell you where Ah Heung is.

2187
01:36:09,864 --> 01:36:11,024
去哪儿了？
Where?

2188
01:36:11,232 --> 01:36:12,927
前几天你们没听八姑说
Didn't you hear Pat Koo say a few days ago

2189
01:36:13,134 --> 01:36:15,625
要把阿香卖到梧州去做妓女吗
she was selling her to Hangchow as a whore?

2190
01:36:17,571 --> 01:36:18,629
你这死小子
You bastard!

2191
01:36:19,039 --> 01:36:19,937
还要打人
You want to assault me as well?

2192
01:36:20,574 --> 01:36:23,134
她一个女儿赚两份钱要打人啊
You're making money twice on your daughter!

2193
01:36:23,878 --> 01:36:25,106
来人   来人
Officers! -Officers!

2194
01:36:25,746 --> 01:36:27,771
把他们两个给我扣起来

2195
01:36:27,982 --> 01:36:29,950
把他们两个扣起来     是
Arrest both of them. -Yes sir!

2196
01:36:30,751 --> 01:36:31,479
老八

2197
01:36:33,154 --> 01:36:34,678
局长大人女婿
Police Chief son-in-law!

2198
01:36:34,889 --> 01:36:36,789
你千万别听那些王八蛋的话
don't listen to those bastards.

2199
01:36:37,958 --> 01:36:42,258
你看我的长相，我就跟菩萨一样
Look at me. I look like a bodhisattva.

2200
01:36:43,063 --> 01:36:45,293
我一点坏事都不会做的
How can I be a bad person?

2201
01:36:46,267 --> 01:36:48,167
再加上你长得这么风流潇洒
Plus you're such devastatingly handsome,

2202
01:36:48,369 --> 01:36:49,666
不但阿香想嫁给你
it's not just Ah Heung who wants to wed you,

2203
01:36:49,870 --> 01:36:51,599
连我都想嫁给你了
even I want to marry you myself!

2204
01:36:51,806 --> 01:36:53,103
老八，老八
Ah Pat, Ah Pat.

2205
01:36:53,440 --> 01:36:55,135
你等一等啊
Wait a minute.

2206
01:36:57,511 --> 01:36:58,273
副官
Officer.

2207
01:36:58,679 --> 01:37:01,375
反正今天晚上也没有新娘敬酒
Since I need a bride tonight anyway,

2208
01:37:01,582 --> 01:37:03,447
她也不错
this one's not too bad.

2209
01:37:03,851 --> 01:37:05,443
那是岳母呀，也要？
But she's your mother-in-law!

2210
01:37:05,920 --> 01:37:07,012
我可没试过
I've never tried one before.

2211
01:37:07,755 --> 01:37:11,782
那就试试吧，抓她妈     是
I might as well give her a go. -Yes Sir

2212
01:37:12,660 --> 01:37:14,685
上轿     是！
Palanquin! -Yes Sir!

2213
01:37:14,895 --> 01:37:16,123
救命呀！
Help!

2214
01:37:16,330 --> 01:37:17,627
老八
Ah pat!

2215
01:37:20,801 --> 01:37:21,790
你想溜啊
Don't try to get away!

2216
01:37:26,006 --> 01:37:26,973
走！
Let's go!
