1
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:22,581
Every person has a past,
be it good or bad.

2
00:00:23,323 --> 00:00:25,791
Every person has a past,
be it good or bad.

3
00:00:26,426 --> 00:00:29,395
It's the same with every city.

4
00:00:30,163 --> 00:00:31,755
The story I'm about to tell

5
00:00:31,965 --> 00:00:34,490
is about a certain city's past

6
00:00:35,135 --> 00:00:37,899
a long, long time in the past.

7
00:01:37,797 --> 00:01:47,433
The House of 72 Tenants

8
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:20,234
The roads are uneven, the lights are dim,

9
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,498
and the tap water's mucky.

10
00:02:34,787 --> 00:02:36,482
Damn this crazy tap!

11
00:02:42,228 --> 00:02:43,889
Washing your hair so early,
Shanghai Po?

12
00:02:45,298 --> 00:02:47,858
Wash with what? This tap's gone crazy!

13
00:02:51,437 --> 00:02:51,801
Fourth Sister!

14
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:53,199
Could you please bring over a bucket

15
00:02:53,406 --> 00:02:54,373
and claim me a place in the queue?

16
00:02:54,574 --> 00:02:55,768
I'll come back to wash later.

17
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:01,242
Hey, Big Guy!

18
00:03:02,415 --> 00:03:04,007
Been swimming so early in the morning?

19
00:03:04,217 --> 00:03:06,208
Swimming my foot! I got soaked!

20
00:03:06,419 --> 00:03:07,784
What are you standing here for?

21
00:03:08,121 --> 00:03:09,281
Go deliver the clothes already!

22
00:03:09,489 --> 00:03:11,787
Get the money
and change it to HK dollars!

23
00:03:11,991 --> 00:03:13,185
All right, I'm going!

24
00:03:17,897 --> 00:03:20,331
Uncle Yeung, off to work so early?

25
00:03:20,667 --> 00:03:22,100
How can I sleep
with all the bugs in my bed?

26
00:03:22,302 --> 00:03:23,132
How can I sleep
with all the bugs in my bed?

27
00:03:23,336 --> 00:03:24,166
True!

28
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:25,860
I still owe you for the cigarettes.

29
00:03:27,106 --> 00:03:28,767
You got them cheap, Shanghai Man.

30
00:03:28,975 --> 00:03:29,703
Morning!

31
00:03:29,909 --> 00:03:32,070
This much will only buy
6 cigarettes today.

32
00:03:32,278 --> 00:03:33,176
I'll pay the extra some other time.

33
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:36,041
It's OK. Prices rise daily. Not your fault.

34
00:03:37,183 --> 00:03:38,616
Morning Mrs Han! - Morning!

35
00:03:38,818 --> 00:03:41,048
Been working all night again?

36
00:03:41,254 --> 00:03:42,186
Yes!

37
00:03:42,789 --> 00:03:44,120
You better go upstairs quickly.

38
00:03:44,324 --> 00:03:47,418
Mr. Han was coughing all night again.

39
00:03:49,395 --> 00:03:50,327
Thank you!

40
00:03:54,367 --> 00:03:55,857
College graduate!

41
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:18,015
Haven't you gone to bed yet?

42
00:04:19,125 --> 00:04:23,255
No, I want to finish this for the paper.

43
00:04:37,543 --> 00:04:39,010
Why aren't you asleep yet?

44
00:04:39,579 --> 00:04:42,571
I bought some medicine. I'll fix it for you.

45
00:04:58,564 --> 00:04:59,462
Good morning, Mrs. Han!

46
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:00,360
Morning!

47
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:02,332
Morning!

48
00:05:06,372 --> 00:05:09,364
Mr Han's an
unemployed university graduate.

49
00:05:09,642 --> 00:05:11,132
After classes,
Mrs Han works as a hostess.

50
00:05:11,344 --> 00:05:12,368
What sort of world is this?

51
00:05:13,179 --> 00:05:14,544
I reckon you're no better!

52
00:05:14,747 --> 00:05:16,510
Quick! Go line up for water! - OK.

53
00:05:18,184 --> 00:05:20,152
Here's something for you to play with.

54
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:27,152
Off to work so early, Brother Fook?

55
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,156
That's right, Uncle Chan.

56
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:31,293
The sooner it's sold, the sooner I'm home.

57
00:05:31,497 --> 00:05:32,395
The later I go to Boss Chin's

58
00:05:32,598 --> 00:05:34,657
to exchange this cash,

59
00:05:34,867 --> 00:05:35,765
the fewer HK dollars it's worth!

60
00:05:36,102 --> 00:05:38,297
Ah Fook! - What is it?

61
00:05:38,805 --> 00:05:39,703
Go see if the cheongsam's dry yet.

62
00:05:39,906 --> 00:05:40,930
Go see if the cheongsam's dry yet.

63
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:42,266
Yes, almighty wife!

64
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:47,335
How's Little Fook?

65
00:05:49,282 --> 00:05:50,613
He still seems
to have a slight temperature.

66
00:05:50,817 --> 00:05:52,910
I'll take him to the doctor when I'm back.

67
00:06:00,393 --> 00:06:01,360
Morning!

68
00:06:10,103 --> 00:06:11,263
Morning!

69
00:06:12,472 --> 00:06:13,769
Shanghai Po. - Ah Heung, you're back.

70
00:06:15,408 --> 00:06:17,035
Yes. Soap's gone up again.

71
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:19,004
I could have bought two bars yesterday

72
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:20,873
for the same price as one today!

73
00:06:21,948 --> 00:06:24,439
How will I ever get through times
like these?

74
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:26,311
Shanghai Po, is there water yet?

75
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:28,043
It's coming. Damn crazy tap!

76
00:06:29,088 --> 00:06:31,079
I'll go get a bucket and queue up.

77
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:33,087
You better hurry.

78
00:06:33,359 --> 00:06:35,327
Shanghai Po. - Good morning!

79
00:06:35,528 --> 00:06:36,790
Good morning, Dr Kim.

80
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:40,196
Could you iron my trousers please?

81
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:42,162
Really, Dr Kim?

82
00:06:42,368 --> 00:06:44,836
Your first house call since moving here!

83
00:06:45,538 --> 00:06:48,063
Can't be helped.
Moving here from Shantung,

84
00:06:48,274 --> 00:06:49,764
I don't know anyone around here.

85
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:52,442
Besides, even a doctor needs luck.

86
00:06:52,645 --> 00:06:54,112
This time, Dr Kim,
you should charge more.

87
00:06:54,313 --> 00:06:55,439
This time, Dr Kim,
you should charge more.

88
00:06:55,648 --> 00:06:59,584
No, I couldn't. A doctor must have ethics.

89
00:06:59,786 --> 00:07:00,684
In Shantung, I never charged the poor.

90
00:07:00,887 --> 00:07:02,650
In Shantung, I never charged the poor.

91
00:07:03,122 --> 00:07:04,521
In that case, I'll register with you!

92
00:07:04,824 --> 00:07:06,291
But a poor people like me

93
00:07:06,492 --> 00:07:08,756
would rather die than be sick.

94
00:07:09,228 --> 00:07:10,661
So, I'd better go iron your trousers.

95
00:07:10,863 --> 00:07:12,160
Thank you. - Don't mention it.

96
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:16,257
Oh, wifey!

97
00:07:16,569 --> 00:07:18,696
Look.
The rats have eaten up the paste again.

98
00:07:19,071 --> 00:07:19,969
What are we going to do?

99
00:07:20,706 --> 00:07:23,140
Borrow some flour from
Wo Kee to make more.

100
00:07:23,509 --> 00:07:26,171
We can't.
We still owe them from last time.

101
00:07:26,579 --> 00:07:27,603
We'll give it all back tomorrow.

102
00:07:27,814 --> 00:07:29,076
How can I work without glue?

103
00:07:31,851 --> 00:07:32,317
Fourth sister. - Morning!

104
00:07:32,518 --> 00:07:33,542
Do you have any flour?

105
00:07:33,853 --> 00:07:35,787
Just ran out. But dad's gone to buy some.

106
00:07:36,923 --> 00:07:40,290
Mrs Chan, the rats got at the paste again?

107
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:42,056
Yes!

108
00:07:42,328 --> 00:07:44,193
How come there's
only half a bag of flour?

109
00:07:44,931 --> 00:07:46,865
Don't you know, the price went up again.

110
00:07:47,066 --> 00:07:48,294
The price of a whole bag yesterday

111
00:07:48,501 --> 00:07:49,593
could only buy half a bag today!

112
00:07:50,503 --> 00:07:51,731
How are we going to stay in business?

113
00:07:52,104 --> 00:07:52,798
We can do the same.

114
00:07:53,005 --> 00:07:54,063
We can always make our fritters thinner.

115
00:07:55,174 --> 00:07:56,038
They're already thin as chopsticks now.

116
00:07:56,242 --> 00:07:57,266
They're already thin as chopsticks now.

117
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:59,502
Any thinner and they'll be toothpicks!

118
00:08:02,582 --> 00:08:04,709
Mrs Chan,
didn't you say you need some flour?

119
00:08:05,017 --> 00:08:06,143
No, I don't need it anymore.

120
00:08:06,352 --> 00:08:07,580
Come on,

121
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:09,553
How can a tailor work without paste?

122
00:08:09,755 --> 00:08:12,246
No, no.

123
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,856
The water's coming! The water's coming!

124
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:20,465
Fourth Sister!

125
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:22,793
Please get a bucket and fetch me some!

126
00:08:24,537 --> 00:08:26,004
Come on.

127
00:08:26,205 --> 00:08:28,673
Ah Heung, could you let me go first?

128
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:29,671
Sure.

129
00:08:33,946 --> 00:08:35,470
You need it right away. You go ahead.

130
00:08:35,681 --> 00:08:36,841
Many thanks!

131
00:08:38,417 --> 00:08:42,513
Turn it off downstairs! Is this a rebellion?

132
00:08:42,722 --> 00:08:44,155
You know very well
I need to wash my face!

133
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:45,381
And yet you turn on the tap full blast!

134
00:08:49,128 --> 00:08:50,425
How are we to know you just got up?

135
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:52,925
Anyway, we haven't drawn our fill yet.

136
00:08:53,132 --> 00:08:56,465
Giving me grief first thing
in the morning!

137
00:08:56,669 --> 00:08:57,795
Damn it! I'll come down and show you.

138
00:08:58,471 --> 00:08:59,233
Ma's coming down. What shall I do?

139
00:08:59,438 --> 00:09:01,065
So what? It's got nothing to do with you.

140
00:09:01,274 --> 00:09:01,569
I...

141
00:09:01,774 --> 00:09:02,866
What are you so afraid of her for?

142
00:09:05,678 --> 00:09:07,771
You're not allowed to use it, damn it!

143
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:09,948
How long do I have to wait
to wash my face?

144
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:12,946
That's not fair, Pat Koo.

145
00:09:13,152 --> 00:09:14,881
You're being unreasonable.

146
00:09:15,521 --> 00:09:17,386
Didn't you install a personal water pipe?

147
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:17,919
That's right!

148
00:09:18,124 --> 00:09:18,988
What do you mean "personal"?

149
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:20,586
With you turning on the tap full blast,

150
00:09:20,793 --> 00:09:21,953
how can any water get up there?

151
00:09:22,528 --> 00:09:25,326
Ma, can't you see I'm already queuing?

152
00:09:27,066 --> 00:09:29,694
Shut up!
I told you last night to come early.

153
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:32,336
How come you're second in the queue?

154
00:09:33,105 --> 00:09:35,130
Don't hit her. Ah Heung let me go first.

155
00:09:36,509 --> 00:09:38,204
You let someone else go first!

156
00:09:38,477 --> 00:09:39,535
When you know
I need water for washing!

157
00:09:39,745 --> 00:09:41,372
You stupid girl!

158
00:09:43,215 --> 00:09:45,843
We still have a big bucket upstairs.

159
00:09:46,986 --> 00:09:48,510
It's none of your business!

160
00:09:48,721 --> 00:09:50,052
Stupid girl! I'll fix you later!

161
00:09:50,389 --> 00:09:52,357
Get the hell back upstairs!

162
00:09:52,558 --> 00:09:53,718
Damn it!

163
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:59,690
What are you cursing about?

164
00:09:59,899 --> 00:10:01,264
It's my water. If I like, I can even sell it.

165
00:10:01,701 --> 00:10:04,192
Right, you better sell it then!

166
00:10:04,537 --> 00:10:08,029
Damn the whole lot of you! Now listen!

167
00:10:08,975 --> 00:10:11,535
I'm making a new rule.

168
00:10:11,877 --> 00:10:13,606
From tomorrow, no one gets water

169
00:10:13,813 --> 00:10:14,745
until after I've finished using it.

170
00:10:15,681 --> 00:10:16,648
That's not right!

171
00:10:17,216 --> 00:10:19,309
We all pay a share of the water bill.

172
00:10:19,518 --> 00:10:20,485
That's right!

173
00:10:20,686 --> 00:10:23,678
You dare bring that up? Let me ask you:

174
00:10:23,889 --> 00:10:26,687
how much water do you use
for your share?

175
00:10:27,693 --> 00:10:28,921
Don't you remember now?

176
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:30,459
Didn't we agree on the matter?

177
00:10:30,663 --> 00:10:32,756
I wash and iron your clothes for free

178
00:10:32,965 --> 00:10:34,592
in return for using so much water.

179
00:10:37,403 --> 00:10:38,802
If it's all the same to you, fine!

180
00:10:39,438 --> 00:10:42,100
I don't need you to wash
and iron from now on.

181
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:42,637
Fine!

182
00:10:42,842 --> 00:10:44,707
Now listen, all of you!

183
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:47,605
From now on, the rule is each household

184
00:10:47,913 --> 00:10:50,643
can only have one tub of water a day.

185
00:10:52,251 --> 00:10:53,115
No way!

186
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:54,081
Damn that bloody bitch!

187
00:10:55,121 --> 00:10:55,815
Ah Fook!

188
00:10:56,122 --> 00:10:56,952
I'll be right back.

189
00:10:58,157 --> 00:10:59,181
Why don't you mind your own business?

190
00:11:00,026 --> 00:11:01,357
You're deliberately targeting me!

191
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:02,754
We run a laundry!

192
00:11:02,962 --> 00:11:04,429
How can a tub of water a day be enough?

193
00:11:04,764 --> 00:11:05,662
Don't worry, Shanghai Po,

194
00:11:06,465 --> 00:11:07,295
I, Olive Vendor Fook, am on your side.

195
00:11:09,368 --> 00:11:10,926
Big talk, little man.

196
00:11:11,137 --> 00:11:11,933
What good are you going to do her?

197
00:11:12,238 --> 00:11:15,503
I can spare you half of my daily water.

198
00:11:15,708 --> 00:11:17,642
Right, right.

199
00:11:17,843 --> 00:11:18,969
What's this, a rebellion? A rebellion?

200
00:11:19,779 --> 00:11:21,906
See? There's nothing to fear.

201
00:11:22,114 --> 00:11:23,411
There are 72 tenants here.

202
00:11:23,616 --> 00:11:25,447
That's 36 buckets of water a day.

203
00:11:25,651 --> 00:11:29,052
Enough even for a restaurant!
-Thank you!

204
00:11:30,022 --> 00:11:32,183
Hear that, Pat Koo?

205
00:11:32,458 --> 00:11:35,484
You'll have to wash
your own clothes now!

206
00:11:35,961 --> 00:11:38,862
We'll continue lining up for water,

207
00:11:39,498 --> 00:11:41,056
and I'll go iron Dr Kim's pants.

208
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:43,995
When my tub's full, please turn it off.

209
00:11:46,305 --> 00:11:46,703
Fat pig!

210
00:11:46,906 --> 00:11:48,897
Pat Koo, let me tell you,

211
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:51,870
one should never push people too far.

212
00:11:52,078 --> 00:11:59,177
You'll get your comeuppance

213
00:11:59,485 --> 00:12:05,890
if you try to hog the water for yourself.

214
00:12:08,494 --> 00:12:10,121
Ah Fook, come back here.

215
00:12:10,329 --> 00:12:11,762
Have some congee and get to work.

216
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:16,893
Eighth Aunt, I'm having congee.
See you!

217
00:12:24,944 --> 00:12:28,004
Come here, Shanghai Po!

218
00:12:28,214 --> 00:12:30,546
What do you want? I'm ironing!

219
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:33,476
What are you trying to do?

220
00:12:34,854 --> 00:12:38,051
I'm known as the battleaxe around here,

221
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:40,248
and you dare pick a fight with me?

222
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:41,583
You picked the fight yourself.

223
00:12:41,794 --> 00:12:45,821
Now you can wash
and iron your own clothes.

224
00:12:46,899 --> 00:12:51,097
Iron...iron...iron...oh no!

225
00:12:52,805 --> 00:12:55,569
Oh no! These are Dr Kim's trousers!

226
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:57,242
They're the only pair he has!

227
00:12:57,443 --> 00:12:58,671
And he has a housecall to make!

228
00:12:58,878 --> 00:13:00,277
They're ruined! What do I do now?

229
00:13:01,247 --> 00:13:03,807
Congratulations, Shanghai Po!

230
00:13:04,016 --> 00:13:06,280
As you sow, so shall you reap!

231
00:13:06,485 --> 00:13:07,816
See how nicely you've ironed

232
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:10,454
Dr Kim's trousers!

233
00:13:10,923 --> 00:13:12,788
Shanghai Po! Shanghai Po!

234
00:13:13,859 --> 00:13:15,156
Are my trousers ready?

235
00:13:15,561 --> 00:13:16,425
I...

236
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:21,191
Ironed crisply, all ironed to a crisp.

237
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,730
What do you mean, ironed to a crisp?

238
00:13:25,437 --> 00:13:26,631
Smells good, too.

239
00:13:29,508 --> 00:13:31,601
Shanghai Po, I'll pay you later.

240
00:13:32,511 --> 00:13:35,742
Dr Kim, look at your leg.

241
00:13:38,951 --> 00:13:41,749
Shanghai Po! What have you done?

242
00:13:41,954 --> 00:13:43,319
This is my only pair of trousers!

243
00:13:43,522 --> 00:13:45,854
My first housecall,
and I have no trousers!

244
00:13:46,158 --> 00:13:48,092
Dr Kim, it's not really my fault!

245
00:13:48,294 --> 00:13:49,886
It's all because of that bitch!

246
00:13:50,095 --> 00:13:51,084
Picking a quarrel while I was ironing!

247
00:13:51,297 --> 00:13:52,662
Picking a quarrel while I was ironing!

248
00:13:54,366 --> 00:13:57,301
You burned his pants. Don't blame me!

249
00:13:57,870 --> 00:13:58,859
That's not right!

250
00:13:59,071 --> 00:14:00,003
We all saw it.

251
00:14:00,206 --> 00:14:02,174
You dragged her out. Don't deny it!

252
00:14:02,541 --> 00:14:03,508
What business is it of yours?

253
00:14:04,276 --> 00:14:06,244
That's right, I did call her out,

254
00:14:06,445 --> 00:14:07,878
I didn't tell her to burn the pants!

255
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:12,947
But I can say a fair word too:

256
00:14:13,152 --> 00:14:14,141
if you want compensation,

257
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:16,981
there's no way this pauper can pay up.

258
00:14:17,623 --> 00:14:19,284
so it's just hard luck to Dr Kim!

259
00:14:19,491 --> 00:14:21,516
so it's just hard luck to Dr Kim!

260
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:24,996
Pat Koo, what a thing to say!

261
00:14:25,564 --> 00:14:28,658
Actually, you should pay for the trousers.

262
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:29,630
What?

263
00:14:29,835 --> 00:14:31,302
Yes, you should pay.

264
00:14:31,503 --> 00:14:32,697
Shut up!

265
00:14:34,306 --> 00:14:35,466
What's this, a rebellion?

266
00:14:37,476 --> 00:14:39,137
You bunch of bastards!

267
00:14:39,345 --> 00:14:41,813
Making so much noise in the morning!

268
00:14:42,014 --> 00:14:42,708
What's going on?

269
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:44,577
This Shanghainese woman

270
00:14:44,783 --> 00:14:47,377
wants me to pay for trousers she burnt!

271
00:14:48,287 --> 00:14:49,720
What sort of reasoning is that?

272
00:14:50,022 --> 00:14:52,149
You burn someone's pants,
and I should pay?

273
00:14:52,358 --> 00:14:53,154
Pay on what basis?

274
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:56,422
I wasn't the one who burned the pants,

275
00:14:56,629 --> 00:14:57,618
and even if I was,

276
00:14:57,830 --> 00:15:00,298
I wouldn't pay if I don't feel like it!

277
00:15:02,334 --> 00:15:03,699
How unreasonable can you get?

278
00:15:06,171 --> 00:15:07,103
Shantung Man,

279
00:15:07,473 --> 00:15:09,373
if you don't want your pants burnt,

280
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:11,338
you should iron them yourself!

281
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:14,770
It's an accident, an act of God,

282
00:15:15,114 --> 00:15:16,103
what more is there to be said?

283
00:15:17,216 --> 00:15:19,047
But these are the only trousers I have!

284
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:20,275
And I still have a housecall to make!

285
00:15:21,153 --> 00:15:23,781
Well, it's no use crying over split milk.

286
00:15:24,356 --> 00:15:26,119
I tell you,
you should count yourself lucky.

287
00:15:26,325 --> 00:15:27,656
If they'd been stolen instead,

288
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:28,827
you wouldn't have anything left!

289
00:15:29,728 --> 00:15:31,195
See? Isn't that fine?

290
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:33,091
You can turn them into a pair of shorts.

291
00:15:33,299 --> 00:15:35,028
Just like the Boy Scouts. Marvellous!

292
00:15:36,302 --> 00:15:39,066
Shorts are ideal for this hot weather.

293
00:15:40,139 --> 00:15:42,369
Oh no.
My son only has one pair of pants.

294
00:15:44,076 --> 00:15:45,270
Are these mine?

295
00:15:46,211 --> 00:15:48,702
Look...there's my name, Kim!

296
00:15:50,516 --> 00:15:52,279
Like I said, when a man's unlucky,

297
00:15:52,484 --> 00:15:53,473
even his trousers will lose a leg.

298
00:15:53,686 --> 00:15:55,654
even his trousers will lose a leg.

299
00:15:55,854 --> 00:15:58,049
You can't blame anyone else

300
00:15:59,124 --> 00:16:01,524
He's got more bad luck coming.

301
00:16:01,727 --> 00:16:02,716
How true!

302
00:16:03,429 --> 00:16:07,593
Chow Bing-Ken. Oh no! Brother Bing!

303
00:16:07,933 --> 00:16:09,332
Do you know this is yours?

304
00:16:11,904 --> 00:16:13,064
Ah Bing! This was made 2 days ago!

305
00:16:13,272 --> 00:16:14,739
Ah Bing! This was made 2 days ago!

306
00:16:15,441 --> 00:16:18,103
Shanghai Po, stay where you are!

307
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:19,641
I'll sue you! You'll pay me back!

308
00:16:19,845 --> 00:16:21,107
You'll bloody well pay me back!

309
00:16:22,614 --> 00:16:24,639
Ah Bing,
if you don't want your pants burnt,

310
00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:25,748
you should iron them yourself!

311
00:16:25,951 --> 00:16:29,011
It's an accident, an act of God,

312
00:16:29,221 --> 00:16:30,188
why should anyone pay?

313
00:16:32,858 --> 00:16:35,349
Count yourself lucky they weren't stolen,

314
00:16:35,561 --> 00:16:38,860
otherwise you'd have nothing left!

315
00:16:39,164 --> 00:16:42,065
But now you can turn them into shorts,

316
00:16:42,267 --> 00:16:45,725
just like the Boy Scouts. Cool too!

317
00:16:46,572 --> 00:16:49,166
Excuse me,
I must go make my housecall.

318
00:16:53,579 --> 00:16:55,945
Why give the pants to that damn woman?

319
00:16:56,815 --> 00:16:58,282
I didn't!

320
00:16:58,484 --> 00:17:00,042
I told Ah Heung to iron it!

321
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:04,080
Ah Heung! - Coming!

322
00:17:04,823 --> 00:17:07,018
What is it, ma?

323
00:17:07,393 --> 00:17:10,260
Who told you to give the pants to her?

324
00:17:10,996 --> 00:17:11,963
You did!

325
00:17:12,364 --> 00:17:14,798
You said Shanghai Po does it for free,

326
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:17,999
and only a fool wouldn't take advantage.

327
00:17:18,203 --> 00:17:19,329
Godammit! Stupid girl, I'll kill you!

328
00:17:20,439 --> 00:17:22,907
Godammit! Stupid girl, I'll kill you!

329
00:17:23,108 --> 00:17:24,507
Hold it! Don't hit her!

330
00:17:26,845 --> 00:17:27,743
What's the matter with you?

331
00:17:27,946 --> 00:17:29,436
He tells you to stop and you stop.

332
00:17:29,648 --> 00:17:30,171
Why are you so obedient?

333
00:17:30,382 --> 00:17:31,610
Standing there like a zombie!

334
00:17:33,786 --> 00:17:34,810
Who are you, you damned kid?

335
00:17:35,854 --> 00:17:37,913
Who am l? Listen well.

336
00:17:39,158 --> 00:17:41,991
I live at No. 96 on this street,

337
00:17:42,194 --> 00:17:44,662
next to Shanghai Po, below the landlady,

338
00:17:45,431 --> 00:17:46,921
to the left of the communal staircase,

339
00:17:47,132 --> 00:17:48,690
in the Chiu Chow cigarette vendor's room,

340
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:50,459
on the bunk you fixed
halfway up the ceiling.

341
00:17:50,669 --> 00:17:52,000
I'm Fat Chai, the cobbler,

342
00:17:52,638 --> 00:17:55,630
one of the 72 tenants here as well.

343
00:17:56,608 --> 00:17:57,666
Why haven't I seen this guy before?

344
00:17:58,410 --> 00:17:59,672
He only moved in a few days ago.

345
00:18:01,713 --> 00:18:03,112
No wonder.

346
00:18:05,017 --> 00:18:07,508
Do you know who I am, kid?

347
00:18:08,053 --> 00:18:08,576
No.

348
00:18:08,787 --> 00:18:09,754
Then, let me tell you.

349
00:18:09,955 --> 00:18:12,253
I'm the husband of the landlady, Pat Koo.

350
00:18:12,624 --> 00:18:14,854
Everyone around here,

351
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:16,618
from 80 year-old codgers to tiny tots of 3,

352
00:18:16,995 --> 00:18:18,826
east to Tungshan, west to West Village,

353
00:18:19,031 --> 00:18:20,794
south to Henan, north to the train station,

354
00:18:20,999 --> 00:18:22,933
everyone knows me, Master Bing!

355
00:18:23,802 --> 00:18:25,064
Everyone except me.

356
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:29,004
God damned kid!

357
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:30,869
How I treat my daughter's
not your business!

358
00:18:31,276 --> 00:18:32,265
Of course it's my business!

359
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:33,942
I must defend the weak against the strong!

360
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:36,142
What?

361
00:18:36,348 --> 00:18:37,940
Defend the weak against the strong?

362
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:39,478
Do you know what Ah Heung is?

363
00:18:42,354 --> 00:18:42,945
She's a woman.

364
00:18:43,355 --> 00:18:44,117
And what are you?

365
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:45,981
A man!

366
00:18:46,925 --> 00:18:47,823
You're her man?

367
00:18:48,293 --> 00:18:50,853
You bloody kid, poking your nose in!

368
00:18:51,196 --> 00:18:52,026
Let me get this straight!

369
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:54,899
Let's be clear about this, you bloody kid!

370
00:18:55,234 --> 00:18:55,893
What are you saying?

371
00:18:56,101 --> 00:18:57,033
That Ah Heung's your woman

372
00:18:57,236 --> 00:18:58,168
and you're her man?

373
00:18:58,704 --> 00:19:02,231
Why ask? You all heard clearly.

374
00:19:02,441 --> 00:19:04,500
Let me ask you.
Am I a man or a woman?

375
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:05,574
A man of course!

376
00:19:05,844 --> 00:19:07,106
Is Ah Heung a man or a woman?

377
00:19:07,946 --> 00:19:08,640
Of course she's a woman!

378
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:09,777
Then isn't it settled? Just now I said

379
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:12,576
that I'm a man and Ah Heung's a woman.

380
00:19:12,784 --> 00:19:14,342
And you say I got it wrong. Idiot!

381
00:19:17,222 --> 00:19:19,417
You son of a bitch, I'll kill you!

382
00:19:20,125 --> 00:19:20,989
Stop it!

383
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:22,590
Stop it! Tell them to come!

384
00:19:23,395 --> 00:19:24,885
Don't fight! Don't fight!

385
00:19:25,931 --> 00:19:27,330
Don't fight! Don't fight!

386
00:19:27,533 --> 00:19:28,397
I'll use my lron Palm on him!

387
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:29,328
Don't fight!

388
00:19:29,535 --> 00:19:31,264
Don't fight! Forget it!

389
00:19:35,107 --> 00:19:36,165
Help him!

390
00:19:39,611 --> 00:19:41,340
Not afraid of lron Palm?
Try my Tai-Chi!

391
00:19:45,384 --> 00:19:46,715
You're crazy!

392
00:19:59,831 --> 00:20:00,661
Get up! Get up!

393
00:20:01,433 --> 00:20:01,990
Don't fight!

394
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:05,295
Damned kid! You wait and see!

395
00:20:05,504 --> 00:20:06,664
I haven't used all my kung fu yet!

396
00:20:06,872 --> 00:20:07,930
Try my Monkey Fist!

397
00:20:08,307 --> 00:20:10,901
Forget it! Stop fighting!

398
00:20:11,243 --> 00:20:11,937
Stop fighting! -Forget about them.

399
00:20:12,144 --> 00:20:12,473
Forget about them.

400
00:20:12,678 --> 00:20:13,702
Forget this bunch of penniless beggars.

401
00:20:14,012 --> 00:20:15,912
I'm telling you,
I'm not demeaning myself

402
00:20:16,114 --> 00:20:17,103
by crossing swords with you peasants!

403
00:20:17,316 --> 00:20:18,476
What? What?

404
00:20:18,684 --> 00:20:19,582
Let's go! Go!

405
00:20:19,785 --> 00:20:20,513
Go! - All right.

406
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:22,016
Just you wait, you damned kid!

407
00:20:22,354 --> 00:20:24,117
You won't be so lucky the next time!

408
00:20:24,323 --> 00:20:24,982
Where are you going?

409
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:29,956
Are you all right?

410
00:20:30,495 --> 00:20:31,723
He didn't touch me.

411
00:20:33,332 --> 00:20:34,060
Are you all right?

412
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,298
Yes, thanks to you.

413
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:40,436
Hey, don't go! I lost a piece of fabric.

414
00:20:41,106 --> 00:20:42,334
None of your business. Go!

415
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:43,007
How can l?

416
00:20:43,208 --> 00:20:44,072
Who knows if it's for real or not?

417
00:20:44,643 --> 00:20:45,041
Damn it!

418
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:45,642
Ah Bing!

419
00:20:45,844 --> 00:20:47,812
Wife, we lost a piece of fabric.

420
00:20:48,013 --> 00:20:48,741
How did that happen?

421
00:20:48,947 --> 00:20:51,074
It vanished during the fight.

422
00:20:51,283 --> 00:20:52,113
What do we do?

423
00:20:52,851 --> 00:20:54,443
Have you lost it for real?

424
00:20:54,653 --> 00:20:55,711
Or are you just making it up?

425
00:20:55,921 --> 00:20:56,751
Of course it's for real!

426
00:20:56,955 --> 00:20:58,980
The fabric looks exactly like this one.

427
00:20:59,324 --> 00:21:00,916
It's for making two cheongsams

428
00:21:01,126 --> 00:21:02,559
for Fourth Aunt's pair of twins.

429
00:21:02,894 --> 00:21:05,124
Say no more.
Everybody stay where you are.

430
00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:07,321
I'm searching you one by one.

431
00:21:07,532 --> 00:21:08,328
Whoever the fabric's found on

432
00:21:08,533 --> 00:21:10,626
will have to compensate us all

433
00:21:10,836 --> 00:21:12,235
for everything we ever lost.

434
00:21:12,437 --> 00:21:13,961
for everything we ever lost.

435
00:21:16,041 --> 00:21:18,532
And if the loot turns up,

436
00:21:18,744 --> 00:21:20,837
Iet him roast a pig to thank the gods

437
00:21:21,046 --> 00:21:23,105
and hold a banquet for all the tenants.

438
00:21:23,815 --> 00:21:25,783
That's too much. Forget it!

439
00:21:26,084 --> 00:21:26,982
Forget it! Forget it!

440
00:21:27,185 --> 00:21:28,049
Forget it! Forget it!

441
00:21:28,253 --> 00:21:31,188
You can forget it, but I can't.

442
00:21:32,424 --> 00:21:34,722
I've lost too much already.

443
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:37,353
If I find the thief,

444
00:21:37,562 --> 00:21:39,860
he will have to compensate me!

445
00:21:40,065 --> 00:21:40,963
Don't talk nonsense.

446
00:21:42,034 --> 00:21:44,935
Let me ask you, what have you lost?

447
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:46,263
Too much!

448
00:21:47,339 --> 00:21:50,365
A gold watch, two 3-catty gold chains...

449
00:21:50,642 --> 00:21:53,110
3 catties? That woud break your neck!

450
00:21:53,512 --> 00:21:54,342
What business is it of yours?

451
00:21:54,546 --> 00:21:55,979
My neck's strong enough!

452
00:21:56,748 --> 00:21:59,683
Also 4 suits, 5 cheongsams,

453
00:22:00,085 --> 00:22:04,613
6 pairs of shoes, 7 hats,

454
00:22:04,823 --> 00:22:07,553
8 antique tables,
9 bedsheets, 10 gold rings,

455
00:22:07,893 --> 00:22:10,054
1 sofa, and 5 chests of drawers.

456
00:22:11,263 --> 00:22:13,493
That's no theft, it's moving house!

457
00:22:14,032 --> 00:22:15,659
Shut up! It's none of your business.

458
00:22:16,034 --> 00:22:17,296
Whoever's lost anything, speak up now.

459
00:22:17,602 --> 00:22:19,194
It's no use speaking up after we find it.

460
00:22:19,404 --> 00:22:20,393
Speak up, speak up.

461
00:22:21,807 --> 00:22:23,604
Ah Bing, stay out of it.

462
00:22:23,809 --> 00:22:25,003
Let's go home.

463
00:22:26,812 --> 00:22:27,801
It's a good way to make money

464
00:22:28,413 --> 00:22:28,902
If I find the fabric on that damned kid,

465
00:22:29,114 --> 00:22:30,308
If I find the fabric on that damned kid,

466
00:22:30,515 --> 00:22:32,949
I can afford everything plus my coffin!

467
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:35,113
Just name a few things you've lost.

468
00:22:35,587 --> 00:22:37,521
That's right, Pat Koo lost some things too.

469
00:22:37,723 --> 00:22:38,246
What did you lose?

470
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:40,023
Nothing. - Nothing?

471
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:42,384
Co...coal, 5 buckets of coal

472
00:22:42,661 --> 00:22:43,593
Upon my life!

473
00:22:43,795 --> 00:22:44,386
What else?

474
00:22:44,596 --> 00:22:45,927
Five gold rings.

475
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:48,026
You bastard. - Ah Fook.

476
00:22:48,934 --> 00:22:49,696
Ah Bing,

477
00:22:50,302 --> 00:22:50,961
I don't think you'll find anything.

478
00:22:51,169 --> 00:22:52,261
Let's go home.

479
00:22:52,637 --> 00:22:53,433
What makes you think
we won't find anything?

480
00:22:54,339 --> 00:22:55,237
Listen everyone.

481
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,499
The fabirc is exactly this colour.

482
00:22:58,810 --> 00:22:59,572
I'll conduct the search.

483
00:23:00,979 --> 00:23:02,844
You look suspicious. You first.
-Hold it!

484
00:23:04,383 --> 00:23:05,281
You search me, who searches you?

485
00:23:06,418 --> 00:23:08,215
Nobody. Do I look like a thief?

486
00:23:08,787 --> 00:23:10,379
You think you'll find the fabric on me?

487
00:23:10,589 --> 00:23:11,419
You're crazy!

488
00:23:11,623 --> 00:23:12,749
Who can tell if you're a thief or not?

489
00:23:12,958 --> 00:23:14,050
If there's a search, we all do it!

490
00:23:14,459 --> 00:23:15,585
OK, let's all search!

491
00:23:15,794 --> 00:23:16,726
But if nothing turns up, you'll be sorry.

492
00:23:18,196 --> 00:23:18,787
Let's search!

493
00:23:19,531 --> 00:23:20,520
What are you doing?

494
00:23:20,732 --> 00:23:21,289
I'm searching him.

495
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:22,364
Ah Ping,
what are you talking with them for?

496
00:23:22,567 --> 00:23:24,592
You'd never steal. Let's go.

497
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:28,268
Away! I'm a man of my word.

498
00:23:28,573 --> 00:23:29,904
I'm no thief. I have nothing to fear.

499
00:23:30,108 --> 00:23:31,006
Yes, search!

500
00:23:31,209 --> 00:23:32,073
Search! Search!

501
00:23:32,277 --> 00:23:33,403
You go search!

502
00:23:33,945 --> 00:23:37,711
I'll search myself! There's nothing.

503
00:23:39,518 --> 00:23:40,212
Nothing.

504
00:23:41,119 --> 00:23:42,518
Won't be anything here.

505
00:23:47,859 --> 00:23:49,451
So he's the thief!

506
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:53,865
Thank the gods! Hold a banquet!

507
00:23:54,065 --> 00:23:55,430
You brought this on yourself.

508
00:23:57,769 --> 00:23:59,202
Old Chan, you framed me!

509
00:23:59,404 --> 00:24:00,268
You slipped it into my pocket!

510
00:24:01,773 --> 00:24:02,398
Ah Fook!

511
00:24:03,041 --> 00:24:03,769
You framed me, didn't you?

512
00:24:04,342 --> 00:24:05,809
I tell you it's not me!

513
00:24:06,011 --> 00:24:06,238
You still deny it?

514
00:24:06,445 --> 00:24:08,379
Master Bing,
don't accuse an innocent person!

515
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:08,807
Ah Fook.

516
00:24:09,014 --> 00:24:09,639
During the fight just now,

517
00:24:09,848 --> 00:24:11,440
I saw someone slip it into your pocket,

518
00:24:11,650 --> 00:24:12,446
I saw someone slip it into your pocket,

519
00:24:12,651 --> 00:24:14,084
but it wasn't Uncle Chan.

520
00:24:14,853 --> 00:24:15,581
You saw someone put it in my pocket?

521
00:24:15,787 --> 00:24:16,981
You saw someone put it in my pocket?

522
00:24:18,056 --> 00:24:21,287
Ah Fook,
didn't I always say you were smart?

523
00:24:21,493 --> 00:24:22,585
You're a decent person.

524
00:24:23,361 --> 00:24:24,487
Did you all hear what he said?

525
00:24:24,896 --> 00:24:26,227
Someone saw him slip the fabric

526
00:24:26,431 --> 00:24:28,023
into my pocket.

527
00:24:29,134 --> 00:24:31,261
Ah Fook, tell me which son of a bitch

528
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:33,199
planted the fabric in my pocket?

529
00:24:33,538 --> 00:24:36,803
I'll wring his neck and bash his head!

530
00:24:37,108 --> 00:24:38,939
I'll strangle him alive!

531
00:24:40,111 --> 00:24:40,770
Brother Fook,

532
00:24:40,979 --> 00:24:42,241
I cut your electricity a few days ago,

533
00:24:42,447 --> 00:24:43,141
It must be such an inconvenience.

534
00:24:43,348 --> 00:24:45,043
I'll reconnect it first thing tomorrow.

535
00:24:46,084 --> 00:24:46,812
How kind!

536
00:24:48,053 --> 00:24:49,782
Of course, you get my meaning.

537
00:24:49,988 --> 00:24:50,818
Of course I get it.

538
00:24:51,890 --> 00:24:53,824
Brother Bing, I can't tell now who it was.

539
00:24:54,693 --> 00:24:55,352
What do you mean, you can't tell?

540
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:55,958
What do you mean, you cant tell?

541
00:24:56,161 --> 00:24:57,423
How would I know
whose neck to break?

542
00:24:57,963 --> 00:24:58,622
You want me to tell?

543
00:24:59,698 --> 00:25:02,223
Don't! Don't tell him it's me!

544
00:25:02,434 --> 00:25:03,264
And you don't want me to tell?

545
00:25:03,902 --> 00:25:04,527
That's not right, Brother Fook.

546
00:25:04,736 --> 00:25:05,634
If you know, you should speak up,

547
00:25:05,837 --> 00:25:06,804
so the rest of us are in the clear.

548
00:25:07,005 --> 00:25:09,337
That's right!

549
00:25:09,541 --> 00:25:10,599
I suppose I'd better tell.

550
00:25:11,343 --> 00:25:12,105
It's her!

551
00:25:19,284 --> 00:25:20,911
Olive Peddler,
you're deliberately doing this!

552
00:25:21,119 --> 00:25:22,609
OK!
I'll have Constable 369 sort you out!

553
00:25:25,123 --> 00:25:27,318
Rice noodles with roast goose,

554
00:25:27,526 --> 00:25:28,322
a big bowl of it,

555
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:30,218
and a bottle, in the alley.

556
00:25:43,008 --> 00:25:43,633
Salute!

557
00:25:44,576 --> 00:25:45,770
What are you doing? It's me!

558
00:25:46,611 --> 00:25:49,045
Master Bing, don't scare me!

559
00:25:49,247 --> 00:25:50,771
You could scare someone to death!

560
00:25:52,584 --> 00:25:54,176
I have to hide in order to eat.

561
00:25:57,389 --> 00:25:58,720
How's this? It's free.

562
00:25:59,524 --> 00:26:01,219
Free? In that case I'll have some.

563
00:26:01,426 --> 00:26:02,154
Excellent!

564
00:26:04,462 --> 00:26:07,954
The same again.

565
00:26:09,534 --> 00:26:12,002
Something you need help with,
Master Bing?

566
00:26:12,771 --> 00:26:14,102
If it's serious, I don't want to know!

567
00:26:14,406 --> 00:26:17,864
Understood. 369, tomorrow I want you

568
00:26:18,076 --> 00:26:20,340
to sort out that olive peddler for me.

569
00:26:21,112 --> 00:26:22,306
You want a packet.

570
00:26:23,882 --> 00:26:25,042
Thanks.

571
00:26:25,417 --> 00:26:26,384
Give me two.

572
00:26:26,585 --> 00:26:29,281
Upstairs.

573
00:26:31,156 --> 00:26:32,919
Money's inside. - Thanks.

574
00:26:34,726 --> 00:26:35,556
You want some?

575
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:36,624
Come.

576
00:26:38,997 --> 00:26:41,932
Me too, Brother Fook. I'll have 3 packets.

577
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,492
How many?

578
00:26:43,702 --> 00:26:44,600
Three packets!

579
00:26:47,906 --> 00:26:48,930
Thanks! - Thanks you!

580
00:26:49,307 --> 00:26:50,103
Brother Fook!

581
00:26:50,308 --> 00:26:51,570
Come, come!

582
00:26:52,544 --> 00:26:53,841
You want some too?

583
00:26:54,746 --> 00:26:57,214
Mister, come ride in my sampan.

584
00:27:00,185 --> 00:27:01,049
Hey Boss, you want a ride?

585
00:27:01,252 --> 00:27:01,980
Hey, Fourth!

586
00:27:02,287 --> 00:27:02,946
What is it, Fifteenth?

587
00:27:03,154 --> 00:27:04,553
Your rice shop sugar daddy's coming.

588
00:27:05,523 --> 00:27:06,251
Fourth.

589
00:27:07,158 --> 00:27:09,058
How come you're so early, Boss Ching?

590
00:27:09,461 --> 00:27:10,052
I dare not be late! Any later,

591
00:27:10,261 --> 00:27:12,525
and someone else might
have hired your boat.

592
00:27:13,164 --> 00:27:15,655
Don't. You really annoyed me last night.

593
00:27:15,967 --> 00:27:16,524
What? -The boat money you gave me.

594
00:27:16,735 --> 00:27:18,794
I changed it today,
and it's only worth half.

595
00:27:19,938 --> 00:27:20,836
Relax.

596
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:23,473
I'm not paying you with money today.

597
00:27:24,142 --> 00:27:25,109
Then what are you paying me with?

598
00:27:32,817 --> 00:27:33,579
1 00 catties of rice.

599
00:27:34,619 --> 00:27:36,644
Good idea! Come on in, hot shot.

600
00:27:37,188 --> 00:27:38,212
You're the one who's hot! -Disgusting!

601
00:27:38,890 --> 00:27:39,982
Come.

602
00:27:40,291 --> 00:27:42,691
Fifteenth! -What is it?

603
00:27:43,128 --> 00:27:44,720
Take this cash and change it to HK dollars.

604
00:27:48,233 --> 00:27:49,723
There's 400 grand here: 4 bucks, exactly!

605
00:27:52,037 --> 00:27:52,935
What? Are you sure?

606
00:27:53,138 --> 00:27:55,663
That guy was paying 1 dollar to 90 grand.

607
00:27:55,874 --> 00:27:58,104
Now I'm giving you 100 grand cash
to a buck.

608
00:27:58,309 --> 00:27:59,401
Here's 10 thousand exactly.

609
00:27:59,844 --> 00:28:01,869
That's how it is.

610
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:03,342
You scrape a bit from left and right.

611
00:28:03,548 --> 00:28:04,742
How else do you make money?

612
00:28:05,083 --> 00:28:05,777
But uncle,

613
00:28:05,984 --> 00:28:07,815
my dad used to say you
were blood brothers.

614
00:28:09,554 --> 00:28:12,079
Let me tell you,
even if it's my own father,

615
00:28:12,290 --> 00:28:13,188
I'd be scraping all the same!

616
00:28:13,958 --> 00:28:15,323
There's no use getting upset over this.

617
00:28:15,527 --> 00:28:17,495
I tell you, when it comes to money,

618
00:28:17,696 --> 00:28:20,028
not even fathers
and sons make a difference.

619
00:28:21,132 --> 00:28:22,064
Four dollars!

620
00:28:31,209 --> 00:28:34,610
Thief! Thief!

621
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:38,042
Constable, there's a thief! He's run off!

622
00:28:38,249 --> 00:28:39,147
Thief? Where?

623
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:41,750
There! -There? OK!

624
00:28:43,822 --> 00:28:45,084
No! He went that way!

625
00:28:45,290 --> 00:28:46,382
Are you crazy or what?

626
00:28:46,591 --> 00:28:47,751
Do I look like I chase thieves?

627
00:28:48,693 --> 00:28:51,127
You don't?

628
00:28:52,530 --> 00:28:54,691
You! Olive peddler! Halt! -369

629
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:58,931
369, I heard someone shout "thief".

630
00:28:59,137 --> 00:28:59,967
Why aren't you chasing the thief?

631
00:29:00,672 --> 00:29:03,470
And risk my life? I didn't hear it. You go.

632
00:29:04,576 --> 00:29:05,338
How pathetic!

633
00:29:05,844 --> 00:29:07,471
Miss, which way did the thief go?

634
00:29:07,979 --> 00:29:09,503
He went that way. -Thanks!

635
00:29:12,050 --> 00:29:13,347
This one's not bad.

636
00:29:13,651 --> 00:29:14,675
Seems there're two kinds of policemen!

637
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:16,952
Are you Fook, the olive peddler?

638
00:29:17,155 --> 00:29:18,417
Yes, I am.

639
00:29:19,924 --> 00:29:22,415
Inside. Move!

640
00:29:22,761 --> 00:29:23,819
What's the matter, brother?

641
00:29:24,562 --> 00:29:25,187
Licence check.

642
00:29:26,331 --> 00:29:28,094
Where would a mobile small
business like mine

643
00:29:28,299 --> 00:29:29,129
get any sort of licence?

644
00:29:29,434 --> 00:29:30,731
Every kind of business needs a licence.

645
00:29:31,102 --> 00:29:31,796
Why didn't you apply for one?

646
00:29:32,303 --> 00:29:35,363
Applying for a licence
is worse than begging.

647
00:29:35,573 --> 00:29:38,133
Your colleagues work slower than snails!

648
00:29:38,443 --> 00:29:40,172
Says who? You try dodging taxes,

649
00:29:40,378 --> 00:29:42,209
then you'd know how fast they work.

650
00:29:42,413 --> 00:29:43,141
You're coming with me to the station.

651
00:29:43,848 --> 00:29:45,338
Wait! Let's talk this over.

652
00:29:46,184 --> 00:29:48,049
OK, let's talk.

653
00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:53,514
What's this? I'm not a palm reader

654
00:29:53,992 --> 00:29:55,960
It isn't palm reading, it's 5 pecks of rice.

655
00:29:56,694 --> 00:29:58,184
5 pecks? You're giving it to me?

656
00:29:58,496 --> 00:29:59,428
Well? Do you have it or not?

657
00:29:59,697 --> 00:30:00,493
Of course not!

658
00:30:01,332 --> 00:30:01,798
How about this?

659
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,160
A summer discount: 3 pecks!

660
00:30:03,835 --> 00:30:04,802
I don't have that much either.

661
00:30:05,003 --> 00:30:05,662
You don't?

662
00:30:06,704 --> 00:30:07,693
Then this is what we'll do.

663
00:30:07,906 --> 00:30:10,204
You can give me 3 HK dollars.

664
00:30:10,408 --> 00:30:12,603
3 HK dollars! You must be kidding!

665
00:30:14,379 --> 00:30:15,869
I didn't know you worse off than me!

666
00:30:16,247 --> 00:30:18,215
All right, let's settle it for a dollar.

667
00:30:19,083 --> 00:30:19,845
That's robbery!

668
00:30:20,218 --> 00:30:21,276
It's hard-earned money!

669
00:30:21,486 --> 00:30:23,420
I've a wife and a kid to support!

670
00:30:25,123 --> 00:30:26,021
Quit complaining!

671
00:30:26,224 --> 00:30:27,987
Money's meant to be shared.

672
00:30:28,293 --> 00:30:30,022
Pay up, or I lock you up.

673
00:30:33,331 --> 00:30:35,731
Dammit! This is outight robbery!

674
00:30:38,303 --> 00:30:39,099
Brother Fook.

675
00:30:40,471 --> 00:30:40,994
What's the matter?

676
00:30:41,472 --> 00:30:42,234
You're back!

677
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:43,429
Your son's very ill!

678
00:30:43,641 --> 00:30:44,573
Go see him, quick!

679
00:30:47,378 --> 00:30:48,538
Ah Fook, Little Fook has a high fever.

680
00:30:48,746 --> 00:30:50,043
Dr Kim says it's acute pneumonia!

681
00:30:50,248 --> 00:30:51,442
He said we must take him to the hospital.

682
00:30:51,649 --> 00:30:52,638
He's gone to make the arrangements.

683
00:30:52,851 --> 00:30:54,478
Where's my wife?
-Gone to borrow money.

684
00:31:00,825 --> 00:31:01,792
Don't move. Don't move.

685
00:31:03,561 --> 00:31:04,721
Don't move. Don't move.

686
00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:07,320
The real McCoy, 3 HK dollars!

687
00:31:08,299 --> 00:31:09,493
Bring more next time.

688
00:31:09,701 --> 00:31:10,599
Go!

689
00:31:11,669 --> 00:31:13,000
Thief!

690
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:17,239
Those god damned thugs!

691
00:31:17,442 --> 00:31:19,171
Stealing people's medical fees!

692
00:31:19,711 --> 00:31:20,939
It's the economy. People turn to crime.

693
00:31:22,647 --> 00:31:23,944
Uncle Chan, what shall we do?

694
00:31:24,349 --> 00:31:26,340
Did you manage to borrow money?

695
00:31:26,684 --> 00:31:28,709
I asked. The hospital fee is $3.

696
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:31,350
Three dollars!

697
00:31:31,556 --> 00:31:33,888
Dr Kim, she's just been robbed!

698
00:31:34,259 --> 00:31:37,092
He'll die if he doesn't go to the hospital!

699
00:31:50,675 --> 00:31:51,369
Ma...

700
00:31:51,576 --> 00:31:54,704
Son, you know we don't have money.

701
00:31:54,913 --> 00:31:56,540
Why did you have to fall sick?

702
00:32:00,251 --> 00:32:01,411
It's such an unlucky coincidence!

703
00:32:01,619 --> 00:32:03,348
I spent all my money on soap.

704
00:32:04,222 --> 00:32:06,520
Me too. I spent mine on flour.

705
00:32:06,724 --> 00:32:07,884
Otherwise...

706
00:32:13,965 --> 00:32:15,489
Ma...

707
00:32:18,603 --> 00:32:20,662
Brother Fook, here's a dollar.

708
00:32:20,872 --> 00:32:22,134
Take it. I'm not buying a blanket.

709
00:32:22,707 --> 00:32:24,299
I just made a dollar today.

710
00:32:24,509 --> 00:32:25,305
You take it first.

711
00:32:26,377 --> 00:32:29,141
We're still a dollar short. Who has it?

712
00:32:34,419 --> 00:32:38,048
Ah Fook, this dollar is my wife's dowry.

713
00:32:38,556 --> 00:32:40,421
I was keeping it for my daughter,

714
00:32:41,225 --> 00:32:43,193
but she was killed in the war.

715
00:32:44,295 --> 00:32:45,227
I've no use for it now.

716
00:32:45,430 --> 00:32:46,658
Use it for your son's treatment.

717
00:32:49,767 --> 00:32:51,234
Thank you, Uncle Chan.

718
00:32:51,436 --> 00:32:53,131
All right, all right, no more words.

719
00:32:53,338 --> 00:32:54,600
Let's get him to the hospital.

720
00:32:54,973 --> 00:32:59,376
I'm coming. Come on. Good boy.

721
00:33:00,211 --> 00:33:01,075
Careful.

722
00:33:01,412 --> 00:33:02,504
Quick, quick!

723
00:33:03,448 --> 00:33:04,813
Hurry up!

724
00:33:10,855 --> 00:33:13,653
Nowadays,
you can't get sick if you're poor.

725
00:33:13,992 --> 00:33:16,790
How true! I'll see if the congee's ready.

726
00:33:18,296 --> 00:33:19,456
We should go wash some clothes.

727
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:24,425
Fat Chai, why is your jacket torn?

728
00:33:26,404 --> 00:33:26,699
It must have got ripped just now

729
00:33:26,904 --> 00:33:28,064
in all the commotion.

730
00:33:28,439 --> 00:33:29,770
My mum's not back yet. Take it off

731
00:33:29,974 --> 00:33:30,906
and I'll mend it for you.

732
00:33:31,642 --> 00:33:32,404
Thank you.

733
00:33:37,548 --> 00:33:38,480
Give it to me. -Thank you!

734
00:33:43,621 --> 00:33:45,350
I've only been here a few days

735
00:33:45,556 --> 00:33:46,318
but I see your mother beat you
all the time.

736
00:33:46,524 --> 00:33:47,320
Why is she so cruel?

737
00:33:48,426 --> 00:33:49,791
I'm not her real daughter.

738
00:33:50,628 --> 00:33:53,654
She bought me when I was 9 years old.

739
00:33:54,032 --> 00:33:54,862
No wonder!

740
00:33:55,433 --> 00:33:56,798
I'm a bit like you.

741
00:33:57,001 --> 00:33:58,366
I also lost my parents when I was little.

742
00:34:01,105 --> 00:34:01,969
Fat Chai,

743
00:34:02,173 --> 00:34:03,800
have you studied a lot?

744
00:34:04,108 --> 00:34:05,166
Who has the money to go to school?

745
00:34:05,376 --> 00:34:06,843
I started mending shoes when I was 1 2.

746
00:34:07,178 --> 00:34:09,146
Then how come you're so capable?

747
00:34:09,347 --> 00:34:10,109
Capable? How so?

748
00:34:10,515 --> 00:34:12,642
Like when you opposed Master Bing,

749
00:34:12,850 --> 00:34:15,114
and the way you help your neighbors.

750
00:34:15,319 --> 00:34:16,650
I don't know how to say it,

751
00:34:16,854 --> 00:34:19,152
but well, you're just too good.

752
00:34:19,357 --> 00:34:20,381
There's nothing on it, really.

753
00:34:20,591 --> 00:34:22,354
As long as a man walks a straight path

754
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:25,120
and doesn't mind taking a few knocks,

755
00:34:26,464 --> 00:34:28,091
he can't go wrong. Is that capable?

756
00:34:28,299 --> 00:34:30,460
No. You can mend clothes and I can't,

757
00:34:30,668 --> 00:34:31,464
so you're more capable than I am!

758
00:34:32,770 --> 00:34:33,634
I'm not talking to you anymore.

759
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:39,476
Fat Chai! Fat Chai!

760
00:34:39,677 --> 00:34:40,439
I'm up here!

761
00:34:41,813 --> 00:34:43,041
What are you doing up there?

762
00:34:43,414 --> 00:34:44,847
Ah Heung's mending my jacket.

763
00:34:46,017 --> 00:34:47,245
All done. -Thank you!

764
00:34:47,452 --> 00:34:49,579
Come have some congee.

765
00:34:51,522 --> 00:34:52,955
Ah Heung, you're here too. Good.

766
00:34:53,791 --> 00:34:56,385
I know you can't eat until Pat Koo's back,

767
00:34:56,894 --> 00:34:58,225
so you must be very hungry.

768
00:34:58,429 --> 00:34:59,396
Here, have some congee first.

769
00:35:00,865 --> 00:35:02,856
No thanks. You two have it.

770
00:35:05,103 --> 00:35:06,229
We'll just each have a little less.

771
00:35:06,437 --> 00:35:08,769
Ah Heung! Ah Heung! What rotten luck!

772
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:10,707
I lost 16 games in 8 rounds of mahjong.

773
00:35:11,375 --> 00:35:15,641
Ah Heung, open the door. -Coming!

774
00:35:17,882 --> 00:35:18,849
Pour me some tea.

775
00:35:24,388 --> 00:35:25,514
Dammit! What rotten luck!

776
00:35:28,993 --> 00:35:29,823
Ma.

777
00:35:31,195 --> 00:35:32,992
Look at your damned face!

778
00:35:33,831 --> 00:35:35,264
It makes me angry just looking at you.

779
00:35:35,566 --> 00:35:36,590
It's all your fault!

780
00:35:37,668 --> 00:35:39,602
Calling me Ma everywhere.

781
00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:41,431
Making me lse 16 games in 8 rounds!

782
00:35:45,243 --> 00:35:46,107
What are you standing there for?

783
00:35:46,477 --> 00:35:47,967
You know very well
I've been playing mahjong.

784
00:35:48,179 --> 00:35:49,305
Give a massage already!

785
00:35:54,352 --> 00:35:55,444
Put a little strength into it.

786
00:35:55,653 --> 00:35:56,347
Haven't you eaten?

787
00:35:57,922 --> 00:35:58,980
No, I haven't.

788
00:35:59,657 --> 00:36:01,056
Wasn't there half a bowl of leftovers?

789
00:36:02,293 --> 00:36:04,591
Half a bowl wasn't filing enough.

790
00:36:05,029 --> 00:36:06,053
Damn you!

791
00:36:08,266 --> 00:36:10,564
Have you gone crazy?

792
00:36:10,768 --> 00:36:11,792
You want to eat me
out of house and home?

793
00:36:12,570 --> 00:36:14,595
Can you keep quiet upstairs?

794
00:36:15,306 --> 00:36:17,240
If you want peace and quiet,

795
00:36:17,642 --> 00:36:19,132
there's a perfect place for it:

796
00:36:19,877 --> 00:36:21,811
why don't you go live in a mortuary?

797
00:36:23,981 --> 00:36:26,541
You're making dust fall.
We're having congee!

798
00:36:27,552 --> 00:36:29,019
You're having congee? So what?

799
00:36:29,353 --> 00:36:31,787
It's not as if you're having a full banquet!

800
00:36:32,223 --> 00:36:35,317
Answer me! -Bitch!

801
00:36:36,827 --> 00:36:38,761
What makes you think
you can pick on me?

802
00:36:40,598 --> 00:36:41,963
I just happen to like it noisy.

803
00:36:42,934 --> 00:36:45,095
Fat Chai, what are you doing?

804
00:36:45,803 --> 00:36:46,963
What are you doing?

805
00:36:48,105 --> 00:36:49,299
You want to tear the house down?

806
00:36:49,607 --> 00:36:50,164
Fat Chai!

807
00:36:50,374 --> 00:36:51,272
Let me be, Uncle Yeung.

808
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:54,804
Help! Someone's tearing down the house!

809
00:36:57,615 --> 00:36:58,775
You damned kid!

810
00:36:58,983 --> 00:36:59,813
Fat Chai!

811
00:37:00,017 --> 00:37:00,381
You think I'm scared of you?

812
00:37:00,585 --> 00:37:02,519
You think I'm scared, is that it?

813
00:37:04,422 --> 00:37:05,354
Fat Chai!

814
00:37:05,556 --> 00:37:06,454
What are you going to do?

815
00:37:07,858 --> 00:37:08,984
Why are you hitting people?

816
00:37:10,294 --> 00:37:11,158
Uncle Yeung, hand me a knife.

817
00:37:11,362 --> 00:37:13,091
I'll cut me some pig's trotters!

818
00:37:14,498 --> 00:37:16,022
Fat Chai!

819
00:37:16,701 --> 00:37:17,190
You dare insult me!

820
00:37:17,401 --> 00:37:18,959
Sorry, sorry!

821
00:37:20,404 --> 00:37:22,338
You damned kid, I'll show you!

822
00:37:25,209 --> 00:37:26,471
Let's see what she'll do.

823
00:37:26,877 --> 00:37:28,003
What's all this racket?

824
00:37:28,546 --> 00:37:29,740
You've come back just in time.

825
00:37:29,947 --> 00:37:32,313
That bloody kid
tried to tear the house down.

826
00:37:32,516 --> 00:37:33,380
Smashed up the floorboards.

827
00:37:33,851 --> 00:37:34,476
Where?

828
00:37:35,419 --> 00:37:36,511
Right here.

829
00:37:38,356 --> 00:37:41,519
It hurts! Just now that bastard

830
00:37:41,726 --> 00:37:43,956
made me so mad I couldn't breathe.

831
00:37:44,161 --> 00:37:47,653
Now my chest hurts! Oh, the agony!

832
00:37:48,232 --> 00:37:50,393
Don't be so angry.

833
00:37:50,601 --> 00:37:52,626
Just leave it to me.

834
00:37:53,070 --> 00:37:54,731
Why trouble yourself so?

835
00:37:55,606 --> 00:37:57,574
Go next door and have a smoke.

836
00:37:57,775 --> 00:37:59,902
Calm yourself down, my dear.

837
00:38:01,279 --> 00:38:02,211
You're right.

838
00:38:02,647 --> 00:38:04,945
Get me the purse, you damned girl!

839
00:38:05,149 --> 00:38:06,173
Hurry up! Hurry up!

840
00:38:09,186 --> 00:38:10,517
Hurry up! Hurry up! -Yes, Ma.

841
00:38:11,489 --> 00:38:12,751
Poor thing.

842
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:18,922
Wait for me, you sex fiend!

843
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:20,119
Yes, Your Majesty.

844
00:38:20,498 --> 00:38:21,362
Don't I wait for you every night?

845
00:38:21,565 --> 00:38:22,554
How can I sleep without you?

846
00:38:23,167 --> 00:38:24,031
Wait for me.

847
00:38:24,935 --> 00:38:27,130
Watch your step. Go slow.

848
00:38:48,125 --> 00:38:49,217
What are you doing, Uncle Bing?

849
00:38:50,995 --> 00:38:51,757
What does it matter?

850
00:38:51,962 --> 00:38:53,293
Just let me give you a little kiss.

851
00:38:54,031 --> 00:38:58,058
Uncle, don't come any closer! No!

852
00:38:58,436 --> 00:38:59,801
What's the big deal?

853
00:39:00,237 --> 00:39:02,364
Actually I think of you every night,

854
00:39:02,573 --> 00:39:03,972
but what can I do
with the missus around?

855
00:39:04,175 --> 00:39:07,633
Look at you, so young and fresh;

856
00:39:08,279 --> 00:39:09,769
how can that old trout compare with you?

857
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:10,776
Come. Give me a kiss.

858
00:39:11,816 --> 00:39:14,046
No! Leave me alone!

859
00:39:15,353 --> 00:39:15,842
What's the big deal?

860
00:39:16,053 --> 00:39:18,112
No! Uncle, don't come any closer

861
00:39:20,558 --> 00:39:21,217
No! No!

862
00:39:21,425 --> 00:39:21,754
What is it!

863
00:39:21,959 --> 00:39:23,358
Uncle Bing, don't come any closer!

864
00:39:23,561 --> 00:39:25,256
If you do, I'll scream!

865
00:39:25,796 --> 00:39:26,728
No, don't!

866
00:39:28,065 --> 00:39:29,396
Help!

867
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:32,125
Fire, fire!

868
00:39:32,336 --> 00:39:33,667
Fire! Put out the fire!

869
00:39:34,205 --> 00:39:35,331
Call the fire brigade!

870
00:39:35,673 --> 00:39:37,538
Fire! Fire!

871
00:39:38,476 --> 00:39:40,205
Ah Heung, are you all right?
-Yes, I'm OK.

872
00:39:41,011 --> 00:39:42,376
Fire!, Fire!

873
00:39:43,447 --> 00:39:45,005
Uncle Hu! Uncle Hu!

874
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:51,385
Fire! Put out the fire!

875
00:39:51,956 --> 00:39:53,116
Put out the fire!

876
00:39:54,558 --> 00:39:55,149
What's the matter?

877
00:39:55,359 --> 00:39:56,690
Fire!

878
00:39:57,361 --> 00:39:59,226
Where's your bell? -I lost it.

879
00:39:59,764 --> 00:40:00,628
Run!

880
00:40:05,403 --> 00:40:07,667
Fire! Help put out the fire!

881
00:40:08,406 --> 00:40:09,464
Help put out the fire!

882
00:40:09,807 --> 00:40:10,899
Fat Chai, where's the fire?

883
00:40:11,308 --> 00:40:13,333
I don't know. I was working,

884
00:40:13,544 --> 00:40:14,704
then I heard Ah Heung cry for help,

885
00:40:14,912 --> 00:40:15,435
so I thought there was a fire.

886
00:40:15,646 --> 00:40:17,944
Damned kid! Where the hell's the fire?

887
00:40:18,616 --> 00:40:20,106
If there's no fire,
why did she cry for help?

888
00:40:21,685 --> 00:40:24,119
Ah Hsiang, you tell me.

889
00:40:24,422 --> 00:40:25,684
I...

890
00:40:25,890 --> 00:40:26,982
Don't be afraid.
There's so many people here.

891
00:40:28,993 --> 00:40:29,960
I'm warning you, Ah Heung,

892
00:40:30,161 --> 00:40:30,786
if you dare say a word,

893
00:40:30,995 --> 00:40:31,654
I'll have your Ma beat you to death.

894
00:40:31,862 --> 00:40:32,453
I...didn't...

895
00:40:32,663 --> 00:40:33,721
You wouldn't dare.

896
00:40:33,931 --> 00:40:34,556
Come home with me.

897
00:40:34,932 --> 00:40:36,559
All right, show's over, break it up.

898
00:40:38,335 --> 00:40:39,427
The firemen are here.

899
00:40:40,171 --> 00:40:41,263
Make way! Make way!

900
00:40:41,605 --> 00:40:42,799
Move back! Move back!

901
00:40:43,007 --> 00:40:45,100
Fire! Move back!

902
00:40:45,476 --> 00:40:46,875
Follow me! Follow me!

903
00:40:47,278 --> 00:40:48,540
Right over here. Follow me!

904
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:51,004
Here's No. 96!

905
00:40:51,215 --> 00:40:52,842
Come on.

906
00:40:53,050 --> 00:40:55,348
Wait. You keep watch out here.

907
00:40:55,553 --> 00:40:56,918
Go!

908
00:40:58,489 --> 00:40:59,751
Who's the landlord?

909
00:40:59,957 --> 00:41:01,754
That's me, that's me.

910
00:41:02,660 --> 00:41:04,218
So it's you, Big Mole.

911
00:41:04,829 --> 00:41:05,693
What's going on? -Listen.

912
00:41:08,265 --> 00:41:09,129
Can we turn the tap on now?

913
00:41:09,533 --> 00:41:10,397
Wait. We're still negotiating.

914
00:41:11,335 --> 00:41:11,960
Listen.

915
00:41:12,336 --> 00:41:13,496
Cash equals splash, no cash no splash.

916
00:41:13,704 --> 00:41:15,194
You pay we spray, no pay no stay.

917
00:41:17,441 --> 00:41:19,068
Sorry,
could you explain that again please?

918
00:41:20,478 --> 00:41:23,038
What a nuisance. Listen carefully.

919
00:41:24,014 --> 00:41:24,810
Listen.

920
00:41:25,015 --> 00:41:26,243
Cash equals splash, no cash no splash.

921
00:41:26,450 --> 00:41:28,350
You pay we spray, no pay no stay.

922
00:41:30,588 --> 00:41:31,418
You're asking for money?

923
00:41:31,822 --> 00:41:34,416
Of course, no money, no talk.

924
00:41:35,459 --> 00:41:36,585
You'd better make up your mind quickly.

925
00:41:37,127 --> 00:41:38,151
The pipe might get blocked any minute.

926
00:41:40,231 --> 00:41:41,892
Brothers, you've made a mistake.

927
00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:43,925
There's no fire here!

928
00:41:45,102 --> 00:41:45,830
No fire?

929
00:41:48,739 --> 00:41:49,763
Preposterous! -You said it.

930
00:41:50,975 --> 00:41:52,135
Are you having us on?

931
00:41:52,676 --> 00:41:54,075
Why call us if there's no fire?

932
00:41:54,345 --> 00:41:55,403
Who made the call?

933
00:41:55,613 --> 00:41:58,047
I did, but he's the one who yelled "fire".

934
00:41:59,316 --> 00:42:00,283
This is a serious transgression.

935
00:42:00,618 --> 00:42:01,243
Quick, quick.

936
00:42:01,785 --> 00:42:03,082
Name and profession?

937
00:42:03,854 --> 00:42:04,878
My name's Fat Chai. I'm a cobbler.

938
00:42:05,623 --> 00:42:06,282
A cobbler?

939
00:42:08,392 --> 00:42:11,088
Cheng, cobblers don't have money.

940
00:42:11,695 --> 00:42:15,563
I know. Big mole, come here.

941
00:42:17,268 --> 00:42:18,360
According to our new regulations,

942
00:42:18,569 --> 00:42:19,900
the one who yells fire gets off,

943
00:42:20,104 --> 00:42:21,765
but whoever calls it in is responsible.

944
00:42:22,106 --> 00:42:24,040
Also, once we're at the scene,

945
00:42:24,241 --> 00:42:26,436
we must hose the house and demolish it.

946
00:42:26,911 --> 00:42:27,775
Demolish the house?

947
00:42:28,579 --> 00:42:31,605
In case a stove or something turns over

948
00:42:31,815 --> 00:42:33,874
and causes a real fire.

949
00:42:34,184 --> 00:42:35,481
Right. Level the house!

950
00:42:40,724 --> 00:42:41,850
No, don't!

951
00:42:42,159 --> 00:42:43,786
Iet's talk this over.

952
00:42:45,763 --> 00:42:48,323
Thus speaketh the beauty, lads.

953
00:42:49,033 --> 00:42:50,694
Big Mole, you know the score.

954
00:42:52,403 --> 00:42:53,734
You name a price.

955
00:42:54,371 --> 00:42:55,360
At the very least, one gold bar.

956
00:42:55,739 --> 00:42:56,797
What? One gold bar?

957
00:42:57,241 --> 00:42:58,003
For this delapidated house?

958
00:42:58,842 --> 00:43:01,606
A delapidated house is dangerous.

959
00:43:02,146 --> 00:43:05,115
Level it. -No!

960
00:43:06,650 --> 00:43:09,414
These guys are hard to handle.

961
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:12,054
I think you had better pay them off.

962
00:43:12,256 --> 00:43:12,585
What should we do?

963
00:43:12,790 --> 00:43:13,552
What's this?

964
00:43:16,527 --> 00:43:17,755
Why are you taking my bracelet?

965
00:43:17,962 --> 00:43:19,054
Treat yourself to a drink.

966
00:43:20,230 --> 00:43:21,254
This is genuine, is it not?

967
00:43:21,565 --> 00:43:22,327
Real gold?

968
00:43:22,533 --> 00:43:23,295
Of course!

969
00:43:23,934 --> 00:43:26,095
We need more than that.

970
00:43:27,304 --> 00:43:28,862
Come on, give me a bit of face.

971
00:43:29,873 --> 00:43:30,897
Come on, give me a bit of face.

972
00:43:31,108 --> 00:43:32,973
All right. This is yours.

973
00:43:33,577 --> 00:43:34,703
Great. -This is mine.

974
00:43:34,912 --> 00:43:35,674
You're a pal.

975
00:43:36,213 --> 00:43:37,612
Big Mole, which flat is yours?

976
00:43:37,815 --> 00:43:39,009
The nicest one, up there.

977
00:43:39,216 --> 00:43:39,978
That one up there.

978
00:43:40,184 --> 00:43:40,673
Come up and have some tea.

979
00:43:40,884 --> 00:43:45,344
In a while, lads. The nicest one up there.

980
00:43:45,556 --> 00:43:46,284
Understood?

981
00:43:47,358 --> 00:43:49,849
Level the nicest one, lads.

982
00:43:50,060 --> 00:43:51,357
Yes sir!

983
00:43:51,562 --> 00:43:53,359
No! No!

984
00:43:53,564 --> 00:43:56,465
I'll give you everything! Everything!

985
00:43:56,667 --> 00:43:58,259
Ah Bing, you still have a pocket watch.

986
00:43:58,469 --> 00:43:59,458
Give them everything!

987
00:44:02,506 --> 00:44:03,234
There's nothing,

988
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:04,907
there's really nothing.

989
00:44:05,576 --> 00:44:06,406
What are you doing?

990
00:44:07,011 --> 00:44:10,003
There's not enough to go round
so many of us.

991
00:44:11,415 --> 00:44:12,177
Are you finished in there?

992
00:44:12,583 --> 00:44:14,414
We got the money. Let's go.

993
00:44:18,255 --> 00:44:20,723
Remember, if ever you have a real fire,

994
00:44:20,924 --> 00:44:22,915
be sure to call us.

995
00:44:24,261 --> 00:44:25,558
Bye!

996
00:44:29,366 --> 00:44:30,924
You god damn bastards!

997
00:44:31,268 --> 00:44:33,463
They're no better than robbers.

998
00:44:35,739 --> 00:44:39,869
Come on, place your bets.

999
00:44:40,077 --> 00:44:41,601
Come on, place your bets.

1000
00:44:48,018 --> 00:44:48,985
Open!

1001
00:44:59,830 --> 00:45:01,092
Brother Shum, we've just changed shifts.

1002
00:45:01,932 --> 00:45:03,399
Off work so soon?

1003
00:45:04,435 --> 00:45:05,663
Yes, it is a bit soon.

1004
00:45:05,869 --> 00:45:07,996
This is your street.

1005
00:45:08,205 --> 00:45:09,365
I'm not here often.

1006
00:45:10,541 --> 00:45:12,008
Wait for me here.

1007
00:45:13,811 --> 00:45:15,278
Place your bets.

1008
00:45:15,479 --> 00:45:17,174
Brother Chung, 369 is over there.

1009
00:45:17,748 --> 00:45:19,682
Damn! Give him some money.

1010
00:45:22,619 --> 00:45:23,745
Fatso, hand me my jacket.

1011
00:45:25,989 --> 00:45:26,478
I'm leaving you in charge.

1012
00:45:26,690 --> 00:45:27,588
Don't worry, leave it to me.

1013
00:45:27,791 --> 00:45:30,316
Place your bets!

1014
00:45:30,527 --> 00:45:34,088
Opening up!

1015
00:45:34,565 --> 00:45:35,429
Place your bets!

1016
00:45:35,632 --> 00:45:37,122
Hands off the table!

1017
00:45:39,103 --> 00:45:40,001
369 -ls that all?

1018
00:45:40,337 --> 00:45:42,100
Yes, business is bad tonight.

1019
00:45:42,506 --> 00:45:43,336
Bad?

1020
00:45:44,174 --> 00:45:45,732
It was 1 and 2 just now. Try 3!

1021
00:45:47,211 --> 00:45:49,008
Not 3. I'll bet on 4.

1022
00:45:49,780 --> 00:45:51,213
Ah Chu, I'm betting on 4.

1023
00:45:51,415 --> 00:45:52,404
Very well, kid.

1024
00:45:53,717 --> 00:45:54,513
369. Your betting on 4.

1025
00:45:54,952 --> 00:45:59,548
There it is. Three!

1026
00:46:05,462 --> 00:46:07,054
369, I've been looking for you all day!

1027
00:46:07,264 --> 00:46:07,992
Where have you been?

1028
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:10,862
What's the matter, Brother Bing?

1029
00:46:11,235 --> 00:46:11,599
I'm telling you,

1030
00:46:11,802 --> 00:46:13,531
I lost a lot of gold bars last night.

1031
00:46:13,937 --> 00:46:15,564
Who'd dare steal from you?

1032
00:46:15,939 --> 00:46:17,930
I'll tell you the details later.

1033
00:46:18,675 --> 00:46:20,472
Listen, go to To Shun Street tomorrow,

1034
00:46:20,677 --> 00:46:22,406
Look for no. 96, Chan Yuen.

1035
00:46:22,679 --> 00:46:24,670
Chan Yuen? I've never been there.

1036
00:46:24,882 --> 00:46:26,372
That's why you need to look for it.

1037
00:46:27,251 --> 00:46:27,774
Remember. Once you're there,

1038
00:46:27,985 --> 00:46:30,112
arrest Fat Chai, the cobbler.

1039
00:46:31,588 --> 00:46:33,249
One, two, three.

1040
00:46:33,657 --> 00:46:35,215
One, two, three.

1041
00:46:35,759 --> 00:46:37,056
One, two.

1042
00:46:41,765 --> 00:46:45,963
One, two, one two.

1043
00:46:46,170 --> 00:46:48,798
Fourth sister, let's go buy some rice.

1044
00:46:49,006 --> 00:46:49,734
I'll go get the money.

1045
00:46:51,308 --> 00:46:53,435
Fat Chai, is there anything you need?

1046
00:46:53,977 --> 00:46:55,808
Nothing, thanks, Mrs Fook.

1047
00:46:56,747 --> 00:46:57,771
OK. Let's go

1048
00:46:59,783 --> 00:47:00,647
See you later, Fat Chai.

1049
00:47:01,285 --> 00:47:02,183
Bye! -Bye!

1050
00:47:06,790 --> 00:47:10,089
Fat Chai! I'm really in trouble this time!

1051
00:47:10,294 --> 00:47:11,158
What's wrong?

1052
00:47:11,361 --> 00:47:12,726
Ma found out what happened

1053
00:47:12,930 --> 00:47:15,262
with Uncle Bing on the night of the fire.

1054
00:47:15,465 --> 00:47:16,796
They had a huge argument

1055
00:47:17,401 --> 00:47:18,766
and now they want to sell me

1056
00:47:18,969 --> 00:47:19,731
to a travel agency to be a tour guide.

1057
00:47:19,937 --> 00:47:20,801
What?

1058
00:47:22,306 --> 00:47:23,637
How can they send you to such a place?

1059
00:47:24,241 --> 00:47:25,435
That's just like becoming a prostitute!

1060
00:47:25,642 --> 00:47:27,075
Fat Chai, you must help me this time!

1061
00:47:27,544 --> 00:47:29,011
Fat Chai, you must help me this time!

1062
00:47:29,513 --> 00:47:30,445
What shall I do now?

1063
00:47:33,083 --> 00:47:33,981
Let's do this.
Go straight to the police station

1064
00:47:34,184 --> 00:47:36,209
and say they're forcing you
into prostitution.

1065
00:47:37,287 --> 00:47:39,812
No. 96, Chan Yuen. This is it.

1066
00:47:40,190 --> 00:47:41,088
Perfect! Here comes a policeman.

1067
00:47:41,925 --> 00:47:44,223
Pal, is there someone here called...

1068
00:47:44,428 --> 00:47:45,725
Mr Policeman,

1069
00:47:45,929 --> 00:47:47,760
this young lady needs to talk to you.

1070
00:47:51,034 --> 00:47:53,662
Such a pretty young lady
wants to talk to me?

1071
00:47:54,037 --> 00:47:56,062
What's the matter? You're crying?

1072
00:47:56,840 --> 00:47:58,137
Tell me what the matter is.

1073
00:47:58,475 --> 00:47:59,203
I... -Well?

1074
00:48:02,079 --> 00:48:05,071
I know. It's you, isn't it?

1075
00:48:05,282 --> 00:48:06,374
You humped her and dumped her, right?

1076
00:48:06,583 --> 00:48:08,414
Shut your big mouth!

1077
00:48:08,819 --> 00:48:10,252
My big mouth?

1078
00:48:10,454 --> 00:48:12,922
I knew you were no good the moment
I saw you.

1079
00:48:13,457 --> 00:48:14,981
Don't be afraid, young lady.

1080
00:48:15,192 --> 00:48:16,682
Whatever it is, you can tell me.

1081
00:48:16,894 --> 00:48:18,521
Once a doctor proves
you've been deflowered,

1082
00:48:18,729 --> 00:48:19,991
I'll arrest him immediately!

1083
00:48:21,365 --> 00:48:22,889
Don't jump to crazy conclusions!

1084
00:48:23,300 --> 00:48:24,426
It's got nothing to do with me.

1085
00:48:24,635 --> 00:48:26,466
Nothing to do with you?

1086
00:48:26,970 --> 00:48:28,631
So who did it? Me?

1087
00:48:28,839 --> 00:48:30,363
It's her mother...

1088
00:48:30,574 --> 00:48:31,632
Now you're trying to blame her mother?

1089
00:48:31,842 --> 00:48:33,070
Why drag her mother into this?

1090
00:48:33,277 --> 00:48:35,177
What did her mother ever do to you?

1091
00:48:35,612 --> 00:48:36,670
What I'm trying to say is,

1092
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:38,472
her mother's forcing her into "business".

1093
00:48:40,150 --> 00:48:41,412
What's wrong with that?

1094
00:48:41,752 --> 00:48:43,913
Think about it, young lady.

1095
00:48:44,121 --> 00:48:45,884
Going into business means
making money.

1096
00:48:46,089 --> 00:48:49,183
Don't you want money?
How old are you?

1097
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:51,088
Nineteen.

1098
00:48:51,495 --> 00:48:52,621
19. You're not a kid anymore!

1099
00:48:52,829 --> 00:48:54,387
I started doing business when I was 16.

1100
00:48:56,133 --> 00:48:57,998
Do you know what kind of business?

1101
00:48:58,335 --> 00:48:58,858
What kind of business?

1102
00:48:59,069 --> 00:49:00,127
To be a so-called "tour guide".

1103
00:49:00,704 --> 00:49:02,831
Tour guide? That's being a prostitute!

1104
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:03,734
Isn't that so!

1105
00:49:04,942 --> 00:49:07,206
A 19-year-old prostitute's a bit young.

1106
00:49:07,644 --> 00:49:09,168
You said you started yourself at 1 6.

1107
00:49:10,080 --> 00:49:11,377
I didn't mean that kind of business!

1108
00:49:11,581 --> 00:49:12,206
What business was it?

1109
00:49:12,416 --> 00:49:14,543
I made matchboxes at home.

1110
00:49:16,186 --> 00:49:18,950
What mother forces her kid
to be a whore?

1111
00:49:19,156 --> 00:49:19,747
Where's her mother?

1112
00:49:19,957 --> 00:49:21,185
She's not her real mother.

1113
00:49:21,391 --> 00:49:22,824
She bought her.

1114
00:49:24,161 --> 00:49:27,062
No wonder! That makes her guilty.

1115
00:49:27,698 --> 00:49:29,723
You can charge her.

1116
00:49:30,067 --> 00:49:30,624
Fat Chai, is that true?

1117
00:49:30,834 --> 00:49:31,391
Fat hai, is that true?

1118
00:49:31,768 --> 00:49:33,099
Sure! I wouldn't lie to you.

1119
00:49:33,303 --> 00:49:35,168
Tell me where I can arrest her.

1120
00:49:35,706 --> 00:49:37,731
Ah Heung,
you don't have to be scared now.

1121
00:49:39,376 --> 00:49:40,308
I never thought there'd
be such a good man

1122
00:49:40,510 --> 00:49:41,704
among the ranks of you policemen.

1123
00:49:43,914 --> 00:49:46,348
From the moment you saw me

1124
00:49:46,550 --> 00:49:49,644
you should have known
369 is a great guy.

1125
00:49:50,587 --> 00:49:52,680
Those deaf,
mute and blind people people

1126
00:49:52,889 --> 00:49:54,880
all think I'm Justice incarnate!

1127
00:49:55,092 --> 00:49:56,252
All right, no more chit-chat.

1128
00:49:56,660 --> 00:49:58,321
go arrest her mother. -Righto.

1129
00:50:00,297 --> 00:50:01,093
Hold it. I didn't come here for this.

1130
00:50:02,432 --> 00:50:04,627
Hold it. I didn't come here for this.

1131
00:50:06,069 --> 00:50:07,058
What did I come here for?

1132
00:50:07,371 --> 00:50:08,201
Did you come to arrest someone?

1133
00:50:08,405 --> 00:50:09,599
That's right, to arrest someone.

1134
00:50:10,007 --> 00:50:10,666
Arrest who?

1135
00:50:12,576 --> 00:50:15,477
Arrest who? Who am I arresting?

1136
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:20,548
Ah Heung!
So there you are, you damned girl!

1137
00:50:20,851 --> 00:50:21,681
That's her mother!

1138
00:50:21,885 --> 00:50:23,819
Got it. Listen, you.

1139
00:50:24,021 --> 00:50:24,817
You old witch!

1140
00:50:25,022 --> 00:50:27,991
You're selling your daughter to an agency.

1141
00:50:28,291 --> 00:50:30,020
That's forcing her into prostitution.

1142
00:50:30,327 --> 00:50:31,726
That's a criminal ofence. Come with me.

1143
00:50:34,698 --> 00:50:36,893
I bought her when she was a child.

1144
00:50:37,100 --> 00:50:38,124
I spent a lot of money raising her.

1145
00:50:38,468 --> 00:50:39,958
So now
I'm selling her on to someone else.

1146
00:50:40,170 --> 00:50:41,000
What's so wrong with that?

1147
00:50:41,605 --> 00:50:43,300
What a bitch! If you want money,

1148
00:50:43,507 --> 00:50:45,338
why don't you go sell yourself?

1149
00:50:45,542 --> 00:50:46,668
Look at you!

1150
00:50:46,877 --> 00:50:49,505
What a crooked-looking face!

1151
00:50:49,713 --> 00:50:51,704
I knew you were no good the moment
I saw you.

1152
00:50:54,184 --> 00:50:57,381
Look at how nice we look, how natural.

1153
00:50:57,587 --> 00:50:58,952
If you look closely,

1154
00:50:59,156 --> 00:51:00,088
you'll see that all three of us

1155
00:51:00,290 --> 00:51:02,758
are regualr, authentic good people!

1156
00:51:03,927 --> 00:51:04,393
Seen enough?

1157
00:51:04,594 --> 00:51:05,788
Come with me to the station!

1158
00:51:07,330 --> 00:51:08,729
You idiot!
What're you standing there for?

1159
00:51:09,199 --> 00:51:10,598
Master Bing, what a coincidence!

1160
00:51:10,801 --> 00:51:11,495
I...

1161
00:51:13,703 --> 00:51:15,136
I've discovered a way to make money.

1162
00:51:15,338 --> 00:51:15,963
What way?

1163
00:51:16,606 --> 00:51:18,233
Someone's forcing girls into prostitution.

1164
00:51:18,942 --> 00:51:19,931
Then you must put the squeeze on her.

1165
00:51:20,143 --> 00:51:21,303
Of course! I know what to do.

1166
00:51:22,312 --> 00:51:23,404
Where's this no-good bitch?

1167
00:51:25,816 --> 00:51:26,680
You god damned bastard!

1168
00:51:27,184 --> 00:51:30,119
Are you blind? That's my wife!

1169
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:32,550
Master Bing, what a kidder you are!

1170
00:51:32,756 --> 00:51:34,724
I know who your wife is.
Fat Woman Sei!

1171
00:51:34,925 --> 00:51:35,357
Go to hell!

1172
00:51:35,559 --> 00:51:37,026
Ah Bing, who's Fat Woman Sei?

1173
00:51:37,227 --> 00:51:38,956
Nothing. You idiot, say hello to my wife!

1174
00:51:39,596 --> 00:51:40,290
This one's your wife too?

1175
00:51:40,497 --> 00:51:41,156
What?

1176
00:51:41,498 --> 00:51:42,692
Nothing, nothing.

1177
00:51:42,899 --> 00:51:43,695
Greet her, quick.

1178
00:51:44,534 --> 00:51:45,296
Ma'am.

1179
00:51:48,705 --> 00:51:49,797
You stupid fool!

1180
00:51:50,006 --> 00:51:51,166
I told you to arrest Fat Chai!

1181
00:51:51,374 --> 00:51:52,341
What are you doing arresting my wife?

1182
00:51:54,344 --> 00:51:57,575
That's right. I came to arrest the cobbler.

1183
00:51:57,781 --> 00:51:58,805
Where's Fat Chai?

1184
00:51:59,449 --> 00:52:00,177
That's him right there.

1185
00:52:02,352 --> 00:52:02,841
That's him.

1186
00:52:03,053 --> 00:52:03,451
That's him?

1187
00:52:03,653 --> 00:52:04,984
Listen, I'm going up.

1188
00:52:05,188 --> 00:52:06,746
You sort things out here. -OK!

1189
00:52:07,491 --> 00:52:09,288
Come with me, you damned girl!

1190
00:52:09,493 --> 00:52:10,824
Arrest her! Quick, arrest her!

1191
00:52:11,161 --> 00:52:11,650
You're under arrest.

1192
00:52:11,862 --> 00:52:14,057
Ah Bing, the truth.
Who's Fat Woman Sei?

1193
00:52:15,365 --> 00:52:16,195
What are you doing?

1194
00:52:16,700 --> 00:52:17,860
Why are you arresting me for no reason?

1195
00:52:18,201 --> 00:52:19,293
For no reason?

1196
00:52:19,503 --> 00:52:20,697
You're the reason I came in the first place!

1197
00:52:21,371 --> 00:52:23,168
As soon as I stepped through the door,

1198
00:52:23,373 --> 00:52:24,931
I knew you were no good.

1199
00:52:25,275 --> 00:52:25,900
That's not right.

1200
00:52:26,109 --> 00:52:27,736
Didn't you say I was a good guy just now?

1201
00:52:28,311 --> 00:52:29,642
That was then, this is now.

1202
00:52:29,846 --> 00:52:30,744
There were lots of rich people last year too

1203
00:52:30,947 --> 00:52:32,380
who've all gone bankrupt this year!

1204
00:52:33,083 --> 00:52:33,879
Age? Speak!

1205
00:52:34,417 --> 00:52:35,042
What's going on?

1206
00:52:35,252 --> 00:52:36,048
It's the draft!

1207
00:52:37,554 --> 00:52:38,543
What's your age? Quick!

1208
00:52:39,556 --> 00:52:40,045
Twenty-four.

1209
00:52:40,257 --> 00:52:41,315
Excellent. You're drafted.

1210
00:52:41,758 --> 00:52:43,589
What? Just on account of my age?

1211
00:52:43,793 --> 00:52:44,987
Any able-bodied male between 1 8 and 24

1212
00:52:45,195 --> 00:52:46,184
Any able-bodied male between 1 8 and 24

1213
00:52:46,396 --> 00:52:47,260
is elible for the draft.

1214
00:52:47,464 --> 00:52:48,226
Come with me to the station.

1215
00:52:48,832 --> 00:52:49,890
Hey, hands off!

1216
00:52:50,100 --> 00:52:51,067
Let's discuss this.

1217
00:52:53,236 --> 00:52:54,863
The moment I laid eyes on you

1218
00:52:55,071 --> 00:52:56,333
I knew you were a smart person.

1219
00:52:56,706 --> 00:52:59,004
You want to discuss things, right?

1220
00:53:05,815 --> 00:53:06,679
What do you mean?

1221
00:53:07,017 --> 00:53:08,382
Standard price. Five pecks of rice.

1222
00:53:08,885 --> 00:53:09,749
Have you gone mad?

1223
00:53:11,488 --> 00:53:14,048
Summer discount. Three pecks.

1224
00:53:14,558 --> 00:53:15,252
You're giving it to me?

1225
00:53:18,295 --> 00:53:19,421
Let's say...

1226
00:53:19,796 --> 00:53:21,263
you give me 3 HK dollars.

1227
00:53:21,765 --> 00:53:23,790
I don't have it either. Just take my life!

1228
00:53:24,901 --> 00:53:26,300
What a stubborn kid you are!

1229
00:53:28,939 --> 00:53:31,169
Just give me a dollar then.

1230
00:53:31,374 --> 00:53:32,068
Up yours! I don't have it.

1231
00:53:37,247 --> 00:53:37,736
Very well then.

1232
00:53:37,948 --> 00:53:39,677
What're you doing? This is robbery!

1233
00:53:39,883 --> 00:53:40,679
It's just a token fine.

1234
00:53:40,884 --> 00:53:41,612
What token fine? It's daylight robbery!

1235
00:53:41,818 --> 00:53:43,115
I'm a cop, I don't have to rob. Idiot!

1236
00:53:43,320 --> 00:53:45,686
What's wrong, Fat Chai?

1237
00:53:46,022 --> 00:53:46,954
Dr Kim, he's robbing me!

1238
00:53:47,157 --> 00:53:48,784
He's a cop, how can he be robbing you?

1239
00:53:49,159 --> 00:53:49,921
He's worse than a common thief!

1240
00:53:50,126 --> 00:53:51,753
What are you saying?

1241
00:53:54,030 --> 00:53:56,430
Are you a doctor? -Yes.

1242
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:57,425
What do you specialise in?

1243
00:53:57,634 --> 00:54:00,194
Gynaecology, surgery, dentistry...

1244
00:54:00,403 --> 00:54:03,304
Dentistry? Geat! I've got a rotten tooth.

1245
00:54:03,506 --> 00:54:04,837
Take it out for me, will you?

1246
00:54:05,508 --> 00:54:07,271
I don't know how to pull teeth!

1247
00:54:08,578 --> 00:54:11,809
What kind of dentist doesn't pull teeth?

1248
00:54:14,050 --> 00:54:15,540
Is it because of my uniform?

1249
00:54:15,752 --> 00:54:17,344
You think I won't pay. Is that it?

1250
00:54:17,787 --> 00:54:19,721
That's the first true thing you said all day.

1251
00:54:19,923 --> 00:54:20,617
Shut up.

1252
00:54:22,726 --> 00:54:25,957
You're asking for it, you old fool.

1253
00:54:26,763 --> 00:54:27,787
How old are you?

1254
00:54:27,998 --> 00:54:29,431
Fifty. Why?

1255
00:54:30,634 --> 00:54:35,970
18 to 40. Have you got a license?

1256
00:54:37,474 --> 00:54:38,771
I just arrived from Shantung.

1257
00:54:38,975 --> 00:54:39,805
Where would I get a licence from?

1258
00:54:40,610 --> 00:54:41,668
Why didn't you apply for one?

1259
00:54:42,612 --> 00:54:44,045
I was intending to,

1260
00:54:44,247 --> 00:54:46,738
but they need guarantees, certificates,

1261
00:54:46,950 --> 00:54:49,316
connections, and dozens of forms filled.

1262
00:54:49,519 --> 00:54:51,043
At the licensing department alone

1263
00:54:51,254 --> 00:54:53,484
I got told off God knows how many times!

1264
00:54:55,425 --> 00:54:57,256
You brought it on yourself.

1265
00:54:57,460 --> 00:54:59,655
You should know
how officialdom operates.

1266
00:55:00,397 --> 00:55:02,092
OK, no more talk. Let's go!

1267
00:55:02,699 --> 00:55:03,825
No licence? Back to the station with me!

1268
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:06,691
Please,
could you do me a favour this once?

1269
00:55:07,704 --> 00:55:08,898
You old fool.

1270
00:55:09,105 --> 00:55:11,835
I told you you were asking for it.

1271
00:55:12,542 --> 00:55:14,271
You want me to let you go? Sure.

1272
00:55:15,745 --> 00:55:16,837
Pull my tooth for me.

1273
00:55:17,047 --> 00:55:19,948
OK, I'll do it. But I need some tools.

1274
00:55:20,750 --> 00:55:22,217
At the very least, a pair of pincers.

1275
00:55:22,419 --> 00:55:23,078
Pincers?

1276
00:55:30,327 --> 00:55:30,884
You're stealing again?

1277
00:55:31,094 --> 00:55:31,560
Wait a minute.

1278
00:55:31,761 --> 00:55:32,853
I'm just borrowing your stuff
for a moment.

1279
00:55:33,063 --> 00:55:34,553
You think I'd steal your money?

1280
00:55:34,764 --> 00:55:35,423
You're crazy!

1281
00:55:35,632 --> 00:55:36,257
You are the one who's crazy!

1282
00:55:38,068 --> 00:55:39,433
Brother, do me a favour.

1283
00:55:39,969 --> 00:55:41,903
The heel's come loose. Fix it, would you?

1284
00:55:42,505 --> 00:55:43,164
Where's the money?

1285
00:55:43,973 --> 00:55:45,167
Come on, we're brothers!

1286
00:55:45,375 --> 00:55:46,307
Who's your brother?

1287
00:55:46,509 --> 00:55:51,776
It's called assisting the police. Fix it!

1288
00:55:52,415 --> 00:55:53,245
Crazy fool!

1289
00:55:54,551 --> 00:55:55,347
There, pincers.

1290
00:55:56,119 --> 00:55:57,518
They're too big. How can I use it?

1291
00:55:57,721 --> 00:55:58,380
Why not?

1292
00:55:59,089 --> 00:56:01,284
Do you want me to arrest you?

1293
00:56:02,092 --> 00:56:04,652
OK, OK. Sit down.

1294
00:56:07,764 --> 00:56:08,458
What are you doing?

1295
00:56:08,665 --> 00:56:09,757
I haven't got the strength.

1296
00:56:11,701 --> 00:56:12,565
Bend a little.

1297
00:56:13,503 --> 00:56:14,094
Which one?

1298
00:56:14,904 --> 00:56:18,067
Down there.

1299
00:56:20,377 --> 00:56:21,639
Your breath really stinks!

1300
00:56:22,112 --> 00:56:23,477
Don't you brush your teeth?

1301
00:56:29,319 --> 00:56:30,718
Which one?

1302
00:56:30,920 --> 00:56:33,115
This one...

1303
00:56:36,693 --> 00:56:37,660
Which one is it?

1304
00:56:37,861 --> 00:56:39,624
This one...

1305
00:56:59,282 --> 00:57:02,046
Have you pulled it yet, old fool?

1306
00:57:03,286 --> 00:57:05,151
I've pulled it. Look, here it is.

1307
00:57:06,656 --> 00:57:08,487
You idiot! You pulled the wrong one!

1308
00:57:09,259 --> 00:57:13,286
It's the one below.
You pulled the one on top!

1309
00:57:13,496 --> 00:57:15,225
The rotten one's still there!

1310
00:57:15,865 --> 00:57:17,332
You got yourself a bargain, 369!

1311
00:57:17,534 --> 00:57:18,694
You like bargains, don't you?

1312
00:57:18,902 --> 00:57:20,893
Buy one, get one free!

1313
00:57:22,439 --> 00:57:23,633
That's right, it's free anyway.

1314
00:57:23,840 --> 00:57:25,398
One tooth or two, it doesn't matter.

1315
00:57:25,608 --> 00:57:26,939
Why don't you have them all pulled?

1316
00:57:27,911 --> 00:57:28,878
I've fixed your shoe. How's that?

1317
00:57:29,345 --> 00:57:30,175
Leave it here.

1318
00:57:33,516 --> 00:57:34,414
Come on, Dr Kim.

1319
00:57:34,984 --> 00:57:35,814
I've got no strength left.

1320
00:57:36,286 --> 00:57:39,016
Give me a hand, Fat Chai. -Sure.

1321
00:57:43,159 --> 00:57:45,354
You want to kill me? What are you,

1322
00:57:45,562 --> 00:57:46,051
a bandit or something?

1323
00:57:46,262 --> 00:57:47,627
Hold tight here.

1324
00:58:02,846 --> 00:58:04,711
Gold, Silver, Violet!

1325
00:58:05,048 --> 00:58:07,778
Come quickly and greet our guests!

1326
00:58:10,153 --> 00:58:11,245
Coming!

1327
00:58:13,857 --> 00:58:15,051
Coming!

1328
00:58:26,035 --> 00:58:26,694
Hurry up!

1329
00:58:26,903 --> 00:58:28,427
They've been waiting a long time.

1330
00:58:34,577 --> 00:58:39,014
Sir, the girls are here.

1331
00:58:39,215 --> 00:58:39,943
Come in quickly.

1332
00:58:43,086 --> 00:58:46,453
Sir, if you want anyone else, just say so.

1333
00:58:46,656 --> 00:58:48,351
That's all right. Maybe I'll have you later.

1334
00:58:48,858 --> 00:58:50,723
You rotter! Go on.

1335
00:58:51,661 --> 00:58:55,028
Boss lady! -Coming.

1336
00:59:01,271 --> 00:59:03,068
What's the matter? Out with it quick.

1337
00:59:03,273 --> 00:59:04,638
369 is here.

1338
00:59:08,344 --> 00:59:11,177
369, have you been poisoned?

1339
00:59:13,149 --> 00:59:14,138
Nail!

1340
00:59:14,617 --> 00:59:15,242
You have a wart?

1341
00:59:15,451 --> 00:59:17,214
What's the matter? Be quick with it.

1342
00:59:18,154 --> 00:59:19,553
Nail your ass!

1343
00:59:19,756 --> 00:59:21,747
This is a coffin nail!

1344
00:59:22,892 --> 00:59:25,258
Where's your boss?

1345
00:59:25,461 --> 00:59:26,689
He's chatting with Pat Koo.

1346
00:59:27,463 --> 00:59:28,259
What did you say?

1347
00:59:29,032 --> 00:59:32,593
Our run-down house is worth 8 bars?

1348
00:59:32,802 --> 00:59:34,565
But we want vacant possession.

1349
00:59:36,372 --> 00:59:39,307
We'll have to rennovate the place.

1350
00:59:41,911 --> 00:59:43,538
Ah Bing, did you hear that?

1351
00:59:43,746 --> 00:59:45,941
Our old house is worth 8 gold bars?

1352
00:59:46,316 --> 00:59:47,442
I heard you. You think I'm deaf?

1353
00:59:50,820 --> 00:59:55,223
How come you have so many
travel agencies,

1354
00:59:55,425 --> 00:59:56,323
Brother Feng?
It's as if by imperial decree!

1355
00:59:57,327 --> 00:59:58,419
It's not imperial decree.

1356
00:59:58,628 --> 01:00:01,654
Her godfather's the police chief, though.

1357
01:00:01,864 --> 01:00:02,888
You stupid fool!

1358
01:00:03,433 --> 01:00:06,061
At festive times, we give a lot of gifts.

1359
01:00:06,436 --> 01:00:09,428
No wonder! But if he's found out,

1360
01:00:09,639 --> 01:00:11,266
won't he get into a lot of trouble?

1361
01:00:12,208 --> 01:00:14,574
What's to worry?
He can always buy a ticket

1362
01:00:14,777 --> 01:00:16,677
and just fly away from it all.

1363
01:00:16,879 --> 01:00:18,676
What trouble will there be then?

1364
01:00:19,382 --> 01:00:20,849
Make way. I want to ask him something.

1365
01:00:21,050 --> 01:00:23,518
Is our house really worth 8 gold bars?

1366
01:00:23,720 --> 01:00:25,312
Of course, darling.

1367
01:00:25,521 --> 01:00:27,148
So who shall we get rid of first?

1368
01:00:27,357 --> 01:00:28,551
Do you have to ask?

1369
01:00:28,758 --> 01:00:30,919
Uncle Yeung the cigarette vendor,
of course.

1370
01:00:31,594 --> 01:00:32,720
Pat Koo, I'll thank you

1371
01:00:32,929 --> 01:00:34,226
not to throw away my things.

1372
01:00:34,697 --> 01:00:37,723
Pat Koo, I beg you, have pity!

1373
01:00:37,934 --> 01:00:40,994
How will I live if you turn me out?

1374
01:00:41,237 --> 01:00:42,465
Uncle Yeung, don't worry.

1375
01:00:42,672 --> 01:00:44,037
How will I live.

1376
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:45,434
What's going on?

1377
01:00:46,476 --> 01:00:47,238
Pat Koo, what are you doing?

1378
01:00:48,044 --> 01:00:49,511
What do you think? I'm evicting him.

1379
01:00:50,179 --> 01:00:51,373
She wants me to move out!

1380
01:00:51,614 --> 01:00:54,276
Hold it! What's going on?

1381
01:00:54,617 --> 01:00:55,675
She's evicting Uncle Yang.

1382
01:00:56,152 --> 01:00:57,119
Why do you want to get rid of him?

1383
01:00:57,687 --> 01:00:59,382
Of course I'm evicting him.
He owes rent.

1384
01:00:59,589 --> 01:01:00,214
What do you think this place is?

1385
01:01:00,423 --> 01:01:01,617
A charity home?

1386
01:01:03,292 --> 01:01:04,281
How much does he owe you?

1387
01:01:05,061 --> 01:01:07,325
A lot! It's 10 catties of rice a month,

1388
01:01:07,530 --> 01:01:08,690
and he owes me for 6 months.

1389
01:01:08,898 --> 01:01:12,129
That's 60 catties. At the market price,

1390
01:01:12,335 --> 01:01:14,735
6 x 7=42, that's 420,000.

1391
01:01:15,905 --> 01:01:16,803
That much?

1392
01:01:18,207 --> 01:01:20,107
Yes. Do you have it?

1393
01:01:21,044 --> 01:01:22,636
How much is it now to buy 2 pots?

1394
01:01:23,312 --> 01:01:24,677
Around 1 00,000.

1395
01:01:24,881 --> 01:01:25,506
Let's say 1 00,000 then.

1396
01:01:27,150 --> 01:01:29,141
Plus all this crockery, cutlery

1397
01:01:29,352 --> 01:01:31,183
and other stuff, another 1 00,000.

1398
01:01:31,621 --> 01:01:33,953
Not that much. 70,000's enough.

1399
01:01:34,157 --> 01:01:35,181
OK, 70,000.

1400
01:01:35,792 --> 01:01:38,260
Uncle Yeung,
how much for the cigarettes?

1401
01:01:38,628 --> 01:01:41,222
My cigarettes? About 40 thousand.

1402
01:01:41,431 --> 01:01:43,331
40,000, 70,000, 100,000.

1403
01:01:43,533 --> 01:01:44,500
That's 210,000 in total.

1404
01:01:45,702 --> 01:01:47,465
You hold this. It's 3 month's rent.

1405
01:01:47,770 --> 01:01:48,668
You'll get the rest later.

1406
01:01:49,405 --> 01:01:50,497
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

1407
01:01:50,707 --> 01:01:51,298
What the hell are you playing at?

1408
01:01:51,507 --> 01:01:52,303
I'm not playing at anythng.

1409
01:01:52,508 --> 01:01:54,100
Don't you have to pay
for breaking things?

1410
01:01:54,677 --> 01:01:56,508
If I had to pay,

1411
01:01:56,779 --> 01:01:57,905
I wouldn't beak them in the first place.

1412
01:01:59,048 --> 01:02:00,481
So you don't have to pay
for breaking things?

1413
01:02:00,683 --> 01:02:01,581
Of course not!

1414
01:02:01,784 --> 01:02:04,810
OK, listen everyone.

1415
01:02:05,021 --> 01:02:06,648
She says you can break things
without paying!

1416
01:02:07,323 --> 01:02:08,620
Let's go upstairs and break all her stuff!

1417
01:02:09,258 --> 01:02:10,816
All right, all right!

1418
01:02:14,030 --> 01:02:16,089
I'll pay, I'll pay.

1419
01:02:16,299 --> 01:02:20,235
I'll pay, I'll pay.

1420
01:02:21,170 --> 01:02:24,162
Damn you, Fat Chai! That's 210,000,

1421
01:02:24,373 --> 01:02:25,635
but he still owes me another 210,000.

1422
01:02:25,842 --> 01:02:27,605
I must be paid today, no matter what.

1423
01:02:27,810 --> 01:02:29,641
Otherwise,
there's nothing more to be said.

1424
01:02:30,346 --> 01:02:34,305
So give it to me. 210,000!

1425
01:02:45,394 --> 01:02:47,419
Fat Chai, I've got 20,000 here.

1426
01:02:50,066 --> 01:02:52,466
Fat Chai, I've got another 30,000.

1427
01:02:52,902 --> 01:02:53,800
OK, 30,000.

1428
01:02:54,804 --> 01:02:56,101
I have 20,000 here, take it.

1429
01:02:58,374 --> 01:03:00,308
Fat Chai, there's 15,000 here.

1430
01:03:02,145 --> 01:03:03,043
Here's 30,000.

1431
01:03:04,046 --> 01:03:05,377
And here's 10,000.

1432
01:03:08,384 --> 01:03:09,510
150,000. Still 60,000 short.

1433
01:03:09,719 --> 01:03:11,050
Can anyone help out? Another 60,000.

1434
01:03:11,454 --> 01:03:13,012
Can anyone help out? Another 60,000.

1435
01:03:14,857 --> 01:03:17,257
You've just finished your medicine.

1436
01:03:17,460 --> 01:03:19,189
The doctor says
you need to get some more.

1437
01:03:20,496 --> 01:03:23,294
Please help. We still need 60,000.

1438
01:03:25,201 --> 01:03:28,967
Pat Koo,
my wife's gone to collect money.

1439
01:03:29,172 --> 01:03:30,764
How about waiting
another couple of hours?

1440
01:03:31,641 --> 01:03:34,007
Who has 60,000, you dmaned idiot?

1441
01:03:34,210 --> 01:03:35,768
How much can you
make washing clothes?

1442
01:03:35,978 --> 01:03:37,036
Don't try to con people.

1443
01:03:38,381 --> 01:03:40,281
Is it enough? If not, out you go!

1444
01:03:42,385 --> 01:03:43,010
Have you got any?

1445
01:03:43,219 --> 01:03:45,483
No? You? -I don't have any either.

1446
01:04:12,181 --> 01:04:14,445
I suppose I'd better go.

1447
01:04:15,084 --> 01:04:17,780
I don't want to trouble you anymore.

1448
01:04:44,914 --> 01:04:49,248
Gramps...

1449
01:05:02,565 --> 01:05:08,026
Little Fook, as long as Gramps is free,

1450
01:05:09,472 --> 01:05:11,838
I'll come back to see you. Be good!

1451
01:05:15,845 --> 01:05:17,745
I want Gramps!

1452
01:05:19,515 --> 01:05:20,777
Uncle Yeung.

1453
01:05:21,284 --> 01:05:23,252
I'd better go.

1454
01:05:29,025 --> 01:05:30,083
Uncle Yeung, don't go.

1455
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:40,592
Uncle Yeung, I've got 60,000 here.

1456
01:05:40,803 --> 01:05:41,929
use it to pay your rent.

1457
01:05:43,306 --> 01:05:44,898
No, Mr Han.

1458
01:05:45,441 --> 01:05:48,604
I know you need it for medicine.

1459
01:05:48,811 --> 01:05:50,608
Keep it for yourself.

1460
01:05:51,514 --> 01:05:54,847
Uncle Yeung, take it for your rent.

1461
01:05:55,051 --> 01:05:56,951
I'll ask Ah fook to borrow
some money tonight

1462
01:05:57,153 --> 01:05:58,142
to pay back Mr Han.

1463
01:05:58,587 --> 01:06:00,521
That's right, Uncle Yeung. You take it.

1464
01:06:00,923 --> 01:06:02,390
We can always borrow some more later.

1465
01:06:02,591 --> 01:06:03,455
That's right.

1466
01:06:03,659 --> 01:06:05,320
That's right.

1467
01:06:05,728 --> 01:06:08,697
Take it, Uncle Yeung.

1468
01:06:11,567 --> 01:06:12,727
Thank you, Mr. Han. Thank you.

1469
01:06:12,935 --> 01:06:16,200
Don't mention it. How will we live

1470
01:06:16,405 --> 01:06:18,430
if we don't help each other?

1471
01:06:18,641 --> 01:06:19,665
Here, give it to me.

1472
01:06:21,644 --> 01:06:23,441
Pat Koo, here's 210,000.

1473
01:06:23,646 --> 01:06:24,374
You better count it.

1474
01:06:24,580 --> 01:06:25,478
I don't have time to count it for you.

1475
01:06:25,915 --> 01:06:28,509
Let's help Uncle Yeung move back in.

1476
01:06:31,187 --> 01:06:34,520
Thanks, everyone, Thank you so much!

1477
01:06:38,561 --> 01:06:41,029
Pat Koo, all this is worth 210,000 too.

1478
01:06:41,230 --> 01:06:43,255
Don't forget it! Don't say it's not enough!

1479
01:06:44,934 --> 01:06:45,958
OK, let's go.

1480
01:06:46,969 --> 01:06:49,062
Everything's fine, let's go.

1481
01:06:51,741 --> 01:06:54,403
I'll get 369 to sort you out, you whore!

1482
01:07:03,085 --> 01:07:04,245
You! Come here!

1483
01:07:07,189 --> 01:07:08,349
Isn't your husband's name Han Yi-Shi?

1484
01:07:08,557 --> 01:07:09,922
Isn't your husband's name Han Yi-Shi?

1485
01:07:10,126 --> 01:07:11,787
Yes. What's the matter?

1486
01:07:11,994 --> 01:07:12,892
Han Yi-Shi.

1487
01:07:16,966 --> 01:07:18,024
You got a licence? I want to check.

1488
01:07:18,501 --> 01:07:19,297
What license?

1489
01:07:19,902 --> 01:07:22,234
You think I don't know you're a hostess?

1490
01:07:22,438 --> 01:07:23,996
Hostesses usually moonlight as prostitutes,

1491
01:07:24,206 --> 01:07:25,434
and unlicensed prostitutes
are against the law.

1492
01:07:25,641 --> 01:07:27,734
Come with me to the police station!

1493
01:07:28,878 --> 01:07:30,607
369, What are you doing here?

1494
01:07:30,813 --> 01:07:31,302
Arresting an unlicensed whore.

1495
01:07:31,614 --> 01:07:32,546
How do you know she's a whore?

1496
01:07:33,215 --> 01:07:34,682
Do you have to ask? Just look at her!

1497
01:07:34,884 --> 01:07:36,784
All tarted up at this hour,

1498
01:07:36,986 --> 01:07:38,044
wandering around the streets,

1499
01:07:38,254 --> 01:07:39,585
how could she be an honest woman?

1500
01:07:40,856 --> 01:07:43,620
You reckon she's pretty? I don't think so.

1501
01:07:43,959 --> 01:07:45,426
I think your wife's prettier.

1502
01:07:46,429 --> 01:07:47,293
You know my wife?

1503
01:07:47,496 --> 01:07:49,521
Sure! She's real hot. -That's right!

1504
01:07:50,366 --> 01:07:53,267
Your wife dressed up in the evening too,

1505
01:07:53,469 --> 01:07:55,835
wandering around, looking great,

1506
01:07:56,605 --> 01:07:59,836
She's tall, right? With great figure.

1507
01:08:00,242 --> 01:08:01,470
Does your wife have a licence?

1508
01:08:02,511 --> 01:08:04,479
She's got me, she doesn't need a licence.

1509
01:08:04,980 --> 01:08:05,878
Drop in to see us when you have time.

1510
01:08:07,349 --> 01:08:07,815
Dammit!

1511
01:08:08,017 --> 01:08:09,314
How could I have blurted this out!

1512
01:08:10,486 --> 01:08:11,350
369...

1513
01:08:13,155 --> 01:08:15,623
your wife's an unlicenced whore.

1514
01:08:15,825 --> 01:08:16,723
Go arrest her!

1515
01:08:17,059 --> 01:08:17,753
You son of a bitch!

1516
01:08:17,960 --> 01:08:19,484
Am I checking her
or are you checking me?

1517
01:08:19,695 --> 01:08:20,389
Get lost!

1518
01:08:21,630 --> 01:08:23,825
Tell me, how old's your husband?

1519
01:08:24,500 --> 01:08:25,023
What for?

1520
01:08:25,234 --> 01:08:26,826
The draft.

1521
01:08:27,036 --> 01:08:27,900
Please don't pick him!

1522
01:08:28,104 --> 01:08:30,595
He's not well. Please!

1523
01:08:31,173 --> 01:08:33,641
OK then. Same old price.

1524
01:08:35,811 --> 01:08:37,301
You... -5 pecks of rice.

1525
01:08:38,881 --> 01:08:40,075
Where would I get 5 pecks of rice?

1526
01:08:40,282 --> 01:08:40,611
Do you have it or not?

1527
01:08:40,816 --> 01:08:42,943
Summer discount, 3 pecks.

1528
01:08:43,919 --> 01:08:44,977
I don't have 3 pecks either.

1529
01:08:45,187 --> 01:08:45,983
OK, let's do this.

1530
01:08:46,422 --> 01:08:47,411
We're all friends here.

1531
01:08:47,623 --> 01:08:49,352
I'll settle for 3 HK dollars.

1532
01:08:50,059 --> 01:08:51,720
How would I have that much
in my purse?

1533
01:08:52,027 --> 01:08:52,721
Let's cut the bull. One dollar!

1534
01:08:52,928 --> 01:08:54,896
Let's cut the bull. One dollar!

1535
01:08:59,668 --> 01:09:00,896
You're more familiar with this
than I am!

1536
01:09:01,103 --> 01:09:01,933
Why don't you have my job?

1537
01:09:02,138 --> 01:09:03,628
We'll split the money.

1538
01:09:04,240 --> 01:09:05,332
Who wants to do what yu do?

1539
01:09:06,208 --> 01:09:07,539
Don't be scared, Mrs Han.

1540
01:09:07,743 --> 01:09:10,177
These people only prey on the weak.

1541
01:09:10,379 --> 01:09:12,040
Just ignore him. Go to work.

1542
01:09:12,248 --> 01:09:13,180
Thanks, Brother Fook.

1543
01:09:13,549 --> 01:09:15,540
369, don't you go too far.

1544
01:09:15,851 --> 01:09:17,113
There are still laws in the world.

1545
01:09:17,319 --> 01:09:19,787
Justice is in men's hearts. You can't win!

1546
01:09:22,558 --> 01:09:23,718
Foiled again!

1547
01:09:23,926 --> 01:09:26,690
You're useless!

1548
01:09:26,896 --> 01:09:28,261
You never do anything right!

1549
01:09:28,464 --> 01:09:29,362
Always messing things up!

1550
01:09:30,432 --> 01:09:32,093
What can I do?

1551
01:09:32,635 --> 01:09:33,567
Even that consumptive guy

1552
01:09:33,769 --> 01:09:36,067
gave away his own medicine money.

1553
01:09:37,006 --> 01:09:39,531
Every time I ask you to sort someone out,

1554
01:09:39,742 --> 01:09:40,902
you always make a mess of things!

1555
01:09:41,110 --> 01:09:42,805
You can't even pass up a buck or two!

1556
01:09:43,479 --> 01:09:46,448
You won't get a buck if you pass it up!

1557
01:09:46,649 --> 01:09:47,013
Yeah!

1558
01:09:47,216 --> 01:09:47,648
You should stop to think:

1559
01:09:47,850 --> 01:09:49,283
if we get rid of these beggars upstairs,

1560
01:09:49,485 --> 01:09:50,543
if we get rid of these beggars upstairs,

1561
01:09:50,753 --> 01:09:52,914
the house alone will be worth 8 gold bars!

1562
01:09:53,289 --> 01:09:53,778
Try to imagine

1563
01:09:53,989 --> 01:09:55,581
if l, Master Bing, had 8 gold bars,

1564
01:09:55,791 --> 01:09:56,951
what benefits might trickle down to you!

1565
01:09:57,159 --> 01:09:58,091
what benefits might trickle down to you!

1566
01:10:00,029 --> 01:10:01,587
Why all the words and no action then?

1567
01:10:01,797 --> 01:10:02,786
Hurry up and think of some way

1568
01:10:02,998 --> 01:10:04,795
to get rid of this lot of beggars.

1569
01:10:06,135 --> 01:10:08,899
I've thought it through.

1570
01:10:09,104 --> 01:10:11,129
Fat Chai's the toughest of the lot.

1571
01:10:11,340 --> 01:10:12,307
We'll del with him first.

1572
01:10:12,641 --> 01:10:15,132
You're right, but how?

1573
01:10:15,411 --> 01:10:16,241
But how?

1574
01:10:19,381 --> 01:10:21,645
Go wrap up a few
of your best cheongsams

1575
01:10:21,850 --> 01:10:23,511
and put them at Fat Chai's place.

1576
01:10:24,053 --> 01:10:26,283
369, you wait outside.

1577
01:10:26,488 --> 01:10:29,753
When Fat Chai returns, you yell "thief".

1578
01:10:29,959 --> 01:10:32,985
369 will conduct a search, find the loot,

1579
01:10:33,395 --> 01:10:35,158
and haul him off to the police station.

1580
01:10:36,098 --> 01:10:38,225
You're real smart.
You deserve to get rich.

1581
01:10:39,435 --> 01:10:40,697
Enough talk. Hurry,
before Fat Chai returns.

1582
01:10:40,903 --> 01:10:42,734
Go put the things on his bunk, now!

1583
01:10:45,274 --> 01:10:47,834
I say, Brother Bing, that's real dastardly!

1584
01:10:48,043 --> 01:10:48,634
Indeed!

1585
01:10:49,511 --> 01:10:50,705
Do you have a son?

1586
01:10:50,913 --> 01:10:51,743
No. Why?

1587
01:10:52,281 --> 01:10:55,375
They say that too many dastardly deeds

1588
01:10:55,584 --> 01:10:56,983
condemn one to having no pogeny.

1589
01:10:57,186 --> 01:10:57,880
Go to hell!

1590
01:11:03,626 --> 01:11:04,490
Fat Chai!

1591
01:11:05,561 --> 01:11:06,459
Ah Bing.

1592
01:11:09,898 --> 01:11:10,557
Hurry!

1593
01:11:12,468 --> 01:11:13,935
Put it in there quickly!

1594
01:11:15,604 --> 01:11:16,901
You keep watch outside. I'll stay here

1595
01:11:29,018 --> 01:11:29,814
Done? -Done.

1596
01:11:31,387 --> 01:11:32,479
Finished work, Fat Chai? -Yes.

1597
01:11:32,888 --> 01:11:34,549
Go upstairs,
then come down and yell "thief".

1598
01:11:38,927 --> 01:11:39,894
Back from work, Fat Chai?

1599
01:11:40,763 --> 01:11:41,252
How is business?

1600
01:11:41,997 --> 01:11:43,794
Thief! Come quickly!

1601
01:11:45,100 --> 01:11:46,431
Thief! Come quickly!

1602
01:11:46,635 --> 01:11:47,329
Thief!

1603
01:11:47,536 --> 01:11:48,025
What's happening?

1604
01:11:48,237 --> 01:11:49,534
I was looking for something just now

1605
01:11:49,738 --> 01:11:51,399
and discovered
I'm missing a red cheonsam,

1606
01:11:51,607 --> 01:11:54,201
a green one,
as well as a padded silk jacket.

1607
01:11:54,410 --> 01:11:56,901
In all, they're worth 100 catties of rice!

1608
01:11:57,112 --> 01:11:57,703
What am I going to do now?

1609
01:11:57,913 --> 01:11:58,709
Hold it, all of you!

1610
01:11:58,914 --> 01:11:59,778
What am I going to do?

1611
01:11:59,982 --> 01:12:02,143
Calm down.
There's no use getting upset.

1612
01:12:02,351 --> 01:12:04,046
Tell us exactly what happened.

1613
01:12:04,386 --> 01:12:06,286
Come, come.

1614
01:12:06,488 --> 01:12:07,352
Tell everyone.

1615
01:12:07,556 --> 01:12:08,545
Come, let's all hear it.

1616
01:12:08,757 --> 01:12:10,816
I'm so upset I can hardly speak.

1617
01:12:12,227 --> 01:12:14,127
Listen, Pat Koo's lost something again.

1618
01:12:14,330 --> 01:12:15,058
Everybody stay where you are.

1619
01:12:15,464 --> 01:12:17,728
If we catch the thief, he's going to jail!

1620
01:12:19,535 --> 01:12:20,524
Stand up here.

1621
01:12:21,670 --> 01:12:23,069
Don't fret, tell us slow and calm.

1622
01:12:23,272 --> 01:12:23,966
Everybody listen!

1623
01:12:24,173 --> 01:12:25,697
Wait a minute. 369! -Here!

1624
01:12:26,008 --> 01:12:26,497
You have your handcuffs with you?

1625
01:12:26,709 --> 01:12:28,006
I've got them.   Ready for an arrest.

1626
01:12:28,210 --> 01:12:28,904
Get ready then.

1627
01:12:29,111 --> 01:12:29,805
OK, tell us.

1628
01:12:31,380 --> 01:12:32,347
Everybody listen.

1629
01:12:33,549 --> 01:12:35,744
I came back this afternoon
and saw a man

1630
01:12:35,951 --> 01:12:36,383
I came back this afternoon
and saw a man

1631
01:12:36,585 --> 01:12:38,052
running down the stairs hurriedly.

1632
01:12:38,253 --> 01:12:39,550
I thought it was a bit strange.

1633
01:12:39,755 --> 01:12:42,588
Then I went upstairs
looking for something,

1634
01:12:42,791 --> 01:12:44,622
and found I was missing
a red cheongsam,

1635
01:12:44,827 --> 01:12:47,159
a green one as well, and a silk jacket.

1636
01:12:47,629 --> 01:12:49,256
I realised I'd been robbed!

1637
01:12:49,465 --> 01:12:50,159
Robbed?

1638
01:12:50,366 --> 01:12:51,424
Did you take a good look at the thief?

1639
01:12:51,633 --> 01:12:52,827
Not really, but I thought he resembled

1640
01:12:53,035 --> 01:12:54,332
Not really, but I thought he resembled

1641
01:12:54,536 --> 01:12:57,232
that damned kid, Fat Chai!

1642
01:12:57,473 --> 01:12:58,804
Are you sure?

1643
01:12:59,341 --> 01:13:00,865
How can Fat hai be a thief?

1644
01:13:01,443 --> 01:13:02,137
Nonsense!

1645
01:13:02,578 --> 01:13:03,169
It couldn't possibly be Fat Chai!

1646
01:13:03,379 --> 01:13:04,437
Pat Koo, have you gone crazy?

1647
01:13:04,780 --> 01:13:05,940
I was working all day,
how could it be me?

1648
01:13:06,148 --> 01:13:06,978
All right, all right.

1649
01:13:07,182 --> 01:13:09,207
Whether it's Fat Chai or not,

1650
01:13:09,418 --> 01:13:10,442
there's no need for a commotion.

1651
01:13:10,652 --> 01:13:11,243
369 is here.

1652
01:13:11,453 --> 01:13:12,613
A search will sort everything out.

1653
01:13:12,821 --> 01:13:15,688
That's right. A search!

1654
01:13:20,028 --> 01:13:21,586
What if he doesn't find anything?

1655
01:13:21,797 --> 01:13:22,456
The stuff's definitely there.

1656
01:13:22,664 --> 01:13:23,824
How can he not find anything?

1657
01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:25,094
What did you say?

1658
01:13:25,401 --> 01:13:26,129
No...she simply said...

1659
01:13:26,335 --> 01:13:28,496
if you stole the stuff, it must be there.

1660
01:13:28,704 --> 01:13:29,363
OK, OK.

1661
01:13:29,571 --> 01:13:30,560
I'm not afraid of any search.

1662
01:13:32,040 --> 01:13:33,735
Quiet! Quiet!

1663
01:13:33,942 --> 01:13:34,772
But what if he finds nothing?

1664
01:13:35,110 --> 01:13:36,236
Unless that's clear, there'll be no search.

1665
01:13:36,545 --> 01:13:37,705
Unless that's clear, there'll be no search.

1666
01:13:38,113 --> 01:13:39,944
He'll find it. What are you afraid f?

1667
01:13:40,215 --> 01:13:41,239
I'm not afraid.
I've nothing to be afraid of.

1668
01:13:42,918 --> 01:13:44,852
Listen to me. Fat Chai's right.

1669
01:13:45,053 --> 01:13:46,042
We must have reward
as well as punishment.

1670
01:13:46,355 --> 01:13:48,516
Otherwise, the innocent will suffer.

1671
01:13:48,724 --> 01:13:49,782
Don't you agree?

1672
01:13:49,992 --> 01:13:52,460
That's right.

1673
01:13:58,066 --> 01:13:58,395
Lets clear the whole thing up.

1674
01:13:58,600 --> 01:13:59,294
Lets clear the whole thing up.

1675
01:13:59,501 --> 01:14:00,399
Alright, alright. Listen, everybody.

1676
01:14:00,836 --> 01:14:03,202
If I don't find the stuff in there,

1677
01:14:03,405 --> 01:14:05,669
then Pat Koo, 369,
and I will kneel down

1678
01:14:05,874 --> 01:14:08,968
and kowtow 3 times to Fat Chai.

1679
01:14:14,249 --> 01:14:16,444
You heard it. If they find nothing,

1680
01:14:16,652 --> 01:14:18,313
the'll kowtow to me 3 times!

1681
01:14:19,221 --> 01:14:20,688
Master Bing, be warned.

1682
01:14:21,356 --> 01:14:22,414
I'm not letting this go.

1683
01:14:22,624 --> 01:14:23,454
Relax.

1684
01:14:27,796 --> 01:14:30,458
Be vigilant, 369. Go!

1685
01:14:48,817 --> 01:14:51,411
Where's the stuff? -Rattan basket...

1686
01:14:58,861 --> 01:14:59,885
Rattan basket.

1687
01:15:01,864 --> 01:15:02,353
Ah Bing,

1688
01:15:02,564 --> 01:15:04,259
Fat Chai's going to jail for sure.

1689
01:15:04,633 --> 01:15:05,565
Why don't we put up a notice now

1690
01:15:05,767 --> 01:15:07,394
to let out his bunk space?

1691
01:15:07,970 --> 01:15:08,994
You'd like to, wouldn't you?

1692
01:15:10,105 --> 01:15:11,402
But there's no need to jump the gun.

1693
01:15:11,707 --> 01:15:13,766
Wait till 369 finds the bundle of clothes.

1694
01:15:19,147 --> 01:15:21,012
Pat Koo, where did you put the stuf?

1695
01:15:23,418 --> 01:15:24,112
What did he say?

1696
01:15:24,686 --> 01:15:26,051
Nothing, he said he's half done.

1697
01:15:26,255 --> 01:15:27,119
Another half to go.

1698
01:15:30,025 --> 01:15:32,186
Damned idiot! Can't even search right!

1699
01:15:32,394 --> 01:15:34,862
There's only one basket on the bunk!

1700
01:15:36,598 --> 01:15:38,088
But there's nothing in the basket!

1701
01:15:40,168 --> 01:15:41,430
369, how can you be so stupid?

1702
01:15:47,476 --> 01:15:48,534
I can't understand it!

1703
01:15:48,744 --> 01:15:50,006
I put it here myself!

1704
01:15:50,345 --> 01:15:51,676
What did you say? -Nothing!

1705
01:15:52,014 --> 01:15:53,481
She thought you put the stuff here.

1706
01:15:53,815 --> 01:15:54,406
You...

1707
01:15:58,020 --> 01:15:58,543
Can you be mistaken?

1708
01:15:59,021 --> 01:15:59,953
Didn't you say you put it here yourself?

1709
01:16:00,155 --> 01:16:00,678
How could I have got it wrong?

1710
01:16:00,889 --> 01:16:02,220
I definitely put it here!

1711
01:16:03,292 --> 01:16:04,691
369, forget it.

1712
01:16:04,893 --> 01:16:05,917
Just haul him off to the police station.

1713
01:16:06,128 --> 01:16:07,595
Without proof, how can I charge him?

1714
01:16:08,797 --> 01:16:10,697
Just say he sold off the loot this afternoon.

1715
01:16:11,466 --> 01:16:13,934
That's wicked!
No wonder you have no son!

1716
01:16:14,436 --> 01:16:15,095
Fat Chai!

1717
01:16:16,405 --> 01:16:18,498
I realise why I can't find the loot.

1718
01:16:18,907 --> 01:16:20,932
You must have sold it off this afternoon.

1719
01:16:21,143 --> 01:16:22,667
Ridiculous! -Don't move!

1720
01:16:24,613 --> 01:16:25,807
As soon as I saw you

1721
01:16:26,014 --> 01:16:28,278
I knew you were no good.

1722
01:16:28,483 --> 01:16:29,211
Come with me to the station!

1723
01:16:32,120 --> 01:16:33,519
Quiet!

1724
01:16:33,722 --> 01:16:36,714
I won't let him go. Where's the loot?

1725
01:16:37,192 --> 01:16:38,159
Hand over the cheongsams!

1726
01:16:38,360 --> 01:16:39,088
Mr 369, Mr 369!

1727
01:16:39,294 --> 01:16:40,124
Hand it over!

1728
01:16:40,329 --> 01:16:41,887
The clothes aren't stolen, they're all here.

1729
01:16:44,433 --> 01:16:45,764
You damned girl!

1730
01:16:47,269 --> 01:16:48,031
I'll kill you!

1731
01:16:48,337 --> 01:16:51,272
The red one, the green, and the silk jacket.

1732
01:16:51,840 --> 01:16:53,967
They're all here, as you can all see.

1733
01:16:54,743 --> 01:16:55,539
You three, on your knees!

1734
01:16:56,111 --> 01:16:57,840
On your knees!

1735
01:17:00,315 --> 01:17:03,148
What? You want to sell us Ah Heung?

1736
01:17:03,485 --> 01:17:04,213
Yes.

1737
01:17:04,419 --> 01:17:05,784
I can't stand her anymore, dammit!

1738
01:17:06,221 --> 01:17:07,483
That bloody girl has no family loyalty,

1739
01:17:07,856 --> 01:17:09,118
always taking the side of that damned kid.

1740
01:17:09,858 --> 01:17:10,722
Pat Koo,

1741
01:17:10,926 --> 01:17:13,258
she's not worth much to us.

1742
01:17:14,630 --> 01:17:16,530
If the price's not right, we won't sell.

1743
01:17:16,832 --> 01:17:18,231
Damn you!
Of course you don't want to sell!

1744
01:17:18,433 --> 01:17:19,798
You want to keep her for yourself!

1745
01:17:20,535 --> 01:17:23,265
I don't care if it's $10 or $20,

1746
01:17:23,472 --> 01:17:25,963
I'm selling her for sure!

1747
01:17:26,174 --> 01:17:27,801
Wait a minute.

1748
01:17:28,810 --> 01:17:29,538
You're scaring me!

1749
01:17:29,745 --> 01:17:30,507
I've found you a good connection.

1750
01:17:30,712 --> 01:17:31,610
What is it, 369?

1751
01:17:31,813 --> 01:17:33,747
Come!
- Stop pulling! What's the matter?

1752
01:17:34,383 --> 01:17:35,680
As soon as I got back to the station house,

1753
01:17:35,884 --> 01:17:38,546
I heard the Chief wants a 7th wife,

1754
01:17:38,754 --> 01:17:40,585
specifically between the ages of 1 7 and 1 8,

1755
01:17:40,789 --> 01:17:42,780
so I imediately thought of Ah Heung.

1756
01:17:42,991 --> 01:17:43,958
You must be joking!

1757
01:17:44,426 --> 01:17:46,519
Your police chief's over 60 years old!

1758
01:17:47,229 --> 01:17:48,628
He'll still want it when he's 80.

1759
01:17:49,264 --> 01:17:51,732
None of his 6 wives has had a child.

1760
01:17:52,534 --> 01:17:55,264
Marriage to the chief is like the draft:

1761
01:17:55,470 --> 01:17:56,528
he offers no betrothal gifts,

1762
01:17:56,738 --> 01:17:59,104
so you lose out on the dowry!

1763
01:17:59,675 --> 01:18:00,198
And you call yourself a man of the world!

1764
01:18:00,409 --> 01:18:02,274
And you call yourself a man of the world!

1765
01:18:02,477 --> 01:18:03,637
If your daughter marries a Police Chief,

1766
01:18:03,845 --> 01:18:05,335
what do you care about betrothal gifts!

1767
01:18:06,014 --> 01:18:07,208
If your daughter marries the Police Chief,

1768
01:18:07,416 --> 01:18:08,815
he'll be your son-in-law.

1769
01:18:09,017 --> 01:18:10,075
Think of the advantages that'll bring!

1770
01:18:10,285 --> 01:18:12,879
Just think it over!

1771
01:18:14,289 --> 01:18:17,850
Pat Koo, 369's right for a change.

1772
01:18:18,060 --> 01:18:20,858
Never mind evicting your 72 tenants,

1773
01:18:21,063 --> 01:18:23,497
you can evict the whole district!

1774
01:18:23,699 --> 01:18:25,860
Evict the whole city, even!

1775
01:18:26,168 --> 01:18:26,862
No, that wouldn't do.

1776
01:18:27,069 --> 01:18:28,696
If I got rid of everyone in the city,

1777
01:18:28,904 --> 01:18:30,201
there'd just be the few of us left.

1778
01:18:30,405 --> 01:18:31,167
It'd be too quiet and lonely.

1779
01:18:31,373 --> 01:18:32,738
You have a point. -Yes.

1780
01:18:34,142 --> 01:18:36,406
369, if this thing works out,

1781
01:18:36,611 --> 01:18:39,444
I'll reward you two nice plump pigs.

1782
01:18:39,881 --> 01:18:42,372
Two pigs? That's a bit heavy.

1783
01:18:42,918 --> 01:18:44,112
You can keep the pigs.

1784
01:18:44,319 --> 01:18:46,480
Just make sure you ask the Chief

1785
01:18:46,688 --> 01:18:49,088
to put a few stripes on my arm.

1786
01:18:50,025 --> 01:18:50,821
Only a few?

1787
01:18:51,026 --> 01:18:52,084
You can have an arm full of them!

1788
01:18:53,962 --> 01:18:55,190
Then you should go make preparations.

1789
01:19:00,268 --> 01:19:01,860
How disgraceful!

1790
01:19:03,071 --> 01:19:04,538
Marrying off a 1 9-year-old girl

1791
01:19:04,740 --> 01:19:06,264
to a 60-year-old man!

1792
01:19:07,142 --> 01:19:08,439
Whoever came up with that idea

1793
01:19:08,643 --> 01:19:09,667
deserves to have a son with no rear end!

1794
01:19:10,011 --> 01:19:11,774
No rear end?
He doesn't deserve a son at all!

1795
01:19:12,180 --> 01:19:14,273
If he can have a son, I should have 10!

1796
01:19:14,616 --> 01:19:15,913
What kind of life will it
be for Ah Heung?

1797
01:19:18,153 --> 01:19:20,383
Dad, Little Fook wants me
to buy him sweets.

1798
01:19:20,756 --> 01:19:21,620
Okay, settle down.

1799
01:19:21,823 --> 01:19:23,256
Take him outside to paly. Go.

1800
01:19:24,126 --> 01:19:24,649
Brother Fook.

1801
01:19:24,860 --> 01:19:25,622
You're back, Brother Fook?

1802
01:19:25,961 --> 01:19:27,428
How's Ah Heung? Where's Fat Chai?

1803
01:19:28,196 --> 01:19:29,424
Fat Chai's gone up to see Ah Heung.

1804
01:19:31,633 --> 01:19:33,032
You stinking beggars!

1805
01:19:33,235 --> 01:19:34,497
What are you jabbering about?

1806
01:19:35,604 --> 01:19:39,540
Tell me, you sons of bitches!

1807
01:19:41,476 --> 01:19:43,706
You know it's my daughter's
wedding day.

1808
01:19:44,112 --> 01:19:45,841
Why don't you come to congratulate me?

1809
01:19:46,047 --> 01:19:46,741
One would think you'd all died!

1810
01:19:47,249 --> 01:19:50,082
They've all gone out to make a living.

1811
01:19:50,285 --> 01:19:51,616
It's not like
you're giving out bridal money.

1812
01:19:53,588 --> 01:19:56,853
So why are you all here?
To plot against me?

1813
01:19:59,394 --> 01:20:00,827
Pat Koo, you've got us wrong.

1814
01:20:01,329 --> 01:20:03,456
We're discussing what presents to give.

1815
01:20:06,501 --> 01:20:08,469
Shanghai Po's giving you a bed.

1816
01:20:09,538 --> 01:20:12,507
I'm going to give you a chest of drawers.

1817
01:20:12,908 --> 01:20:13,704
A chest of drawers!

1818
01:20:15,043 --> 01:20:18,672
Mrs Chan's a dozen cheongsams
just for you,

1819
01:20:19,114 --> 01:20:21,514
since you're giving away your daughter.

1820
01:20:23,218 --> 01:20:25,516
Remember to make the waist a bit tighter,

1821
01:20:25,720 --> 01:20:26,982
and the slit higher!

1822
01:20:31,526 --> 01:20:32,458
There's more.

1823
01:20:33,195 --> 01:20:34,685
Dr Kim, the Hans,

1824
01:20:34,896 --> 01:20:36,090
and a few other neighbors

1825
01:20:36,298 --> 01:20:39,096
are ordering a 3-catty gold chain for you.

1826
01:20:40,535 --> 01:20:42,526
Dr Kim, what an extravagance!

1827
01:20:43,438 --> 01:20:44,564
I don't know what to say.

1828
01:20:44,873 --> 01:20:47,433
Ah Fook, you must bring the gifts early,

1829
01:20:47,642 --> 01:20:49,735
I've got to prepare a banquet for you.

1830
01:20:50,412 --> 01:20:51,401
Oh, that's not necessary.

1831
01:20:52,113 --> 01:20:53,740
Of course it is.

1832
01:20:53,949 --> 01:20:55,473
You're giving me so many gifts,

1833
01:20:55,684 --> 01:20:57,049
how can I not invite you?

1834
01:20:58,253 --> 01:20:59,220
But I haven't finished.

1835
01:20:59,921 --> 01:21:01,889
I didn't sell all my olives today,

1836
01:21:02,357 --> 01:21:04,222
Dr Kim saw no patients,

1837
01:21:04,626 --> 01:21:06,526
and we didn't find money on the street.

1838
01:21:06,895 --> 01:21:08,954
So...

1839
01:21:10,599 --> 01:21:11,293
What are you saying?

1840
01:21:11,900 --> 01:21:13,800
So we can't give you anything!

1841
01:21:14,002 --> 01:21:14,832
Damn you!

1842
01:21:18,974 --> 01:21:21,033
You stinking beggars!

1843
01:21:21,243 --> 01:21:23,871
Ganging up to make a fool of me!

1844
01:21:24,880 --> 01:21:28,179
Wait till my daughter
comes home to visit.

1845
01:21:28,383 --> 01:21:29,213
Then you'll see!

1846
01:21:29,551 --> 01:21:31,451
Pat Koo,
aren't you throwing a 10-table banquet

1847
01:21:31,653 --> 01:21:32,711
to which we're all invited?

1848
01:21:32,921 --> 01:21:35,355
Ten tables? You'll all be stuffed to death!

1849
01:21:36,291 --> 01:21:37,280
I'll throw all right...

1850
01:21:38,326 --> 01:21:40,294
I'll throw you all out!

1851
01:21:47,168 --> 01:21:48,328
Fat Chai, how's Ah Heung?

1852
01:21:48,837 --> 01:21:50,566
The windows are closed.
I couldn't see her.

1853
01:21:50,772 --> 01:21:52,034
But I heard her crying inside

1854
01:21:52,240 --> 01:21:54,470
I think you'd best her away from here.

1855
01:21:55,076 --> 01:21:57,010
I wish I could, but it's too late.

1856
01:21:57,445 --> 01:21:58,810
Sir, sir.

1857
01:21:59,314 --> 01:22:02,181
Madam. Sir.

1858
01:22:02,851 --> 01:22:04,341
Coming! Coming right down!

1859
01:22:06,388 --> 01:22:07,582
You stinking beggars.

1860
01:22:07,856 --> 01:22:09,050
Get ready to move out,

1861
01:22:09,457 --> 01:22:10,253
or I'll have you all arrested.

1862
01:22:11,426 --> 01:22:12,256
Hurry up!

1863
01:22:12,694 --> 01:22:13,592
I must lock the door first.

1864
01:22:13,895 --> 01:22:14,759
If that damned girl escapes,

1865
01:22:14,963 --> 01:22:16,157
we'll be in trouble.

1866
01:22:18,600 --> 01:22:19,328
Madam.

1867
01:22:20,402 --> 01:22:21,528
Has the Police Chief arrive?

1868
01:22:22,003 --> 01:22:23,903
Not yet. I saw him getting ready

1869
01:22:24,105 --> 01:22:24,764
and came to tell you

1870
01:22:24,973 --> 01:22:26,463
to get ready to welcome him outside.

1871
01:22:26,675 --> 01:22:28,666
That will certainly please him.

1872
01:22:28,877 --> 01:22:29,844
Yes, yes. Let's go.

1873
01:22:30,045 --> 01:22:30,670
Sir. Madam.

1874
01:22:31,146 --> 01:22:32,511
When you meet
your Police Chief son-in-law,

1875
01:22:32,714 --> 01:22:33,772
don't forget to mention my stripes!

1876
01:22:33,982 --> 01:22:35,210
Don't worry. You'll get a bunch of them.

1877
01:22:38,019 --> 01:22:39,987
Madam, please. -Sir, please.

1878
01:22:41,022 --> 01:22:44,856
Please.

1879
01:22:51,666 --> 01:22:52,360
What's so funny?

1880
01:22:53,535 --> 01:22:54,627
What's so funny?

1881
01:22:56,938 --> 01:22:59,498
Go on up.

1882
01:23:02,377 --> 01:23:03,742
Fat Chai, what are you going up for?

1883
01:23:04,112 --> 01:23:04,976
I'm going to save Ah Heung.

1884
01:23:05,313 --> 01:23:06,302
Don't climb the pipes
or smash floorboards.

1885
01:23:09,651 --> 01:23:12,745
Ah Heung. -It's you!

1886
01:23:13,088 --> 01:23:13,747
I'm taking you away.

1887
01:23:15,824 --> 01:23:16,722
Hurry!

1888
01:23:17,592 --> 01:23:18,456
Madam. I'm going to watch out for them.

1889
01:23:21,363 --> 01:23:22,455
Hurry!

1890
01:23:23,498 --> 01:23:25,728
Ah Heung's coming. -Ah Heung.

1891
01:23:26,134 --> 01:23:26,623
Take Ah Heung away while they're gone!

1892
01:23:26,835 --> 01:23:27,665
Take Ah Heung away while they're gone!

1893
01:23:30,071 --> 01:23:31,038
I can't go now!

1894
01:23:31,239 --> 01:23:32,228
I'll get you all into trouble!

1895
01:23:32,607 --> 01:23:33,699
Your going won't have anything to do
with us.

1896
01:23:33,908 --> 01:23:35,876
Hurry, go before it's too late!

1897
01:23:37,145 --> 01:23:38,203
Fat Chai, here's some money.

1898
01:23:38,413 --> 01:23:39,675
Take Ah Heung and go!

1899
01:23:42,317 --> 01:23:43,147
Here's some money.

1900
01:23:43,351 --> 01:23:44,784
Hurry, go!

1901
01:23:45,553 --> 01:23:47,953
Hurry, go!

1902
01:23:48,990 --> 01:23:49,786
Where are you going?

1903
01:23:50,058 --> 01:23:50,547
I'm taking Ah Heung away.

1904
01:23:50,759 --> 01:23:52,590
You can't go.
Pat Koo's already in the alley.

1905
01:23:53,628 --> 01:23:54,219
Dammit!

1906
01:23:54,429 --> 01:23:55,293
What dreadful timing!

1907
01:23:55,497 --> 01:23:56,327
What dreadful timing!

1908
01:23:56,631 --> 01:23:58,531
Dr Kim, you're an educated man,

1909
01:23:58,733 --> 01:24:00,963
Can't you think of some way
to help them?

1910
01:24:01,169 --> 01:24:03,433
Too bad Mr Han's queuing at the hospital,

1911
01:24:03,738 --> 01:24:04,170
otherwise there'd be one more person

1912
01:24:04,372 --> 01:24:06,101
To help think of what to do. -Yes.

1913
01:24:06,508 --> 01:24:07,406
He's queuing at the hospital?

1914
01:24:08,276 --> 01:24:10,836
That's it! I've got an idea!

1915
01:24:12,547 --> 01:24:14,014
What is it?

1916
01:24:15,050 --> 01:24:15,948
Hang on.

1917
01:24:16,384 --> 01:24:18,944
Shanghai Po, this is a laxative.

1918
01:24:19,454 --> 01:24:21,684
Get Pat Koo to take it somehow.

1919
01:24:22,257 --> 01:24:24,122
Ah Heung, put on some men's clothes.

1920
01:24:24,325 --> 01:24:24,916
Fat Chai,

1921
01:24:25,126 --> 01:24:26,991
wrap her up in a quilt blanket.

1922
01:24:27,328 --> 01:24:27,817
Wrap her up?

1923
01:24:28,029 --> 01:24:29,189
Dr Kim, what's all this about?

1924
01:24:29,798 --> 01:24:33,461
You don't understand. Come!

1925
01:24:35,603 --> 01:24:37,628
369, the Police Chief is coming.
Wait here

1926
01:24:37,839 --> 01:24:38,806
I have something to do for Ah Pat.

1927
01:24:39,007 --> 01:24:40,304
All right. Please.

1928
01:24:46,981 --> 01:24:49,040
Help!

1929
01:24:55,156 --> 01:24:57,317
Damn it! It's my daughter's wedding!

1930
01:24:57,525 --> 01:24:58,583
Are you trying to murder someone?

1931
01:24:59,027 --> 01:25:01,052
Pat Koo, Dr Kim's in the wrong this time.

1932
01:25:01,262 --> 01:25:02,251
A doctor can't refuse to see a patient.

1933
01:25:02,730 --> 01:25:03,958
It's not an illness I can treat!

1934
01:25:05,767 --> 01:25:07,962
Fat Chai, put down your chopper.

1935
01:25:08,670 --> 01:25:09,534
It's like this.

1936
01:25:09,737 --> 01:25:11,830
Fat Chai had a friend stay over last night

1937
01:25:12,040 --> 01:25:13,302
who didn't feel well this morning,

1938
01:25:13,508 --> 01:25:14,566
so he went to see Dr Kim.

1939
01:25:14,776 --> 01:25:18,143
All right, it's his funeral.

1940
01:25:18,346 --> 01:25:19,176
None of our business!

1941
01:25:19,681 --> 01:25:20,773
Go and take a leak already!

1942
01:25:21,616 --> 01:25:22,548
That's not right!

1943
01:25:22,917 --> 01:25:23,815
Do you know what disease he's got?

1944
01:25:24,486 --> 01:25:25,976
It couldn't be cholera, could it?

1945
01:25:26,921 --> 01:25:27,683
It is indeed cholera!

1946
01:25:31,292 --> 01:25:32,987
Say that again? -It's like this.

1947
01:25:34,262 --> 01:25:35,320
Let me tell you what happened.

1948
01:25:35,897 --> 01:25:36,989
My friend didn't feel well this morning.

1949
01:25:37,198 --> 01:25:38,290
He had the runs and felt dizzy,

1950
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:40,228
so I took him to see Dr Kim.

1951
01:25:40,702 --> 01:25:41,999
ut he told me it was cholera

1952
01:25:42,504 --> 01:25:44,472
and wouldn't even take a look.

1953
01:25:44,672 --> 01:25:45,502
Doesn' he have any medical ethics?

1954
01:25:45,707 --> 01:25:48,767
But this disease is contagious!

1955
01:25:49,477 --> 01:25:51,411
Pat Koo, that's nothing to worry about.

1956
01:25:51,613 --> 01:25:52,944
Comes to the worst,
we'll just be quarantined.

1957
01:25:53,548 --> 01:25:55,243
But what if the Police Chief finds out?

1958
01:25:55,450 --> 01:25:57,145
He may not want Ah Heung anymore!

1959
01:25:57,652 --> 01:25:58,346
Think of something!

1960
01:25:59,220 --> 01:26:01,188
Dr Kim!

1961
01:26:01,856 --> 01:26:04,086
You old bastard!
Refusing to treat a patient!

1962
01:26:04,292 --> 01:26:05,520
What kind of a doctor are you?

1963
01:26:05,927 --> 01:26:06,586
Let me tell you,

1964
01:26:06,794 --> 01:26:08,455
if my daughter's wedding falls through,

1965
01:26:08,663 --> 01:26:10,563
I won't let you get away with it!

1966
01:26:11,065 --> 01:26:14,000
Pat Koo, it's all the Shantung guy's fault!

1967
01:26:14,202 --> 01:26:15,430
Don't upset yourself so.

1968
01:26:15,870 --> 01:26:17,098
Have a cup of hot tea.

1969
01:26:17,605 --> 01:26:18,537
I'm so mad!

1970
01:26:22,243 --> 01:26:24,734
Shanghai Po, you're very kind this time.

1971
01:26:24,946 --> 01:26:25,878
You deserve it.

1972
01:26:26,748 --> 01:26:29,080
Shantung Man, do something quickly!

1973
01:26:29,817 --> 01:26:31,808
Pat Koo, it's an incurable disease.

1974
01:26:32,020 --> 01:26:32,952
He'll die for sure.

1975
01:26:33,321 --> 01:26:33,787
What are you saying?

1976
01:26:33,988 --> 01:26:35,353
You might have to put up
with a corpse here.

1977
01:26:35,757 --> 01:26:36,815
What a stroke of luck, Pat Koo!

1978
01:26:37,025 --> 01:26:38,549
You can have a wedding and a funeral!

1979
01:26:38,860 --> 01:26:42,261
Damn you! Do something, quick!

1980
01:26:42,463 --> 01:26:44,761
Or I'll have your hide for this!

1981
01:26:44,966 --> 01:26:45,933
Pat Koo.

1982
01:26:47,702 --> 01:26:50,500
It's too late to save him. All we can do

1983
01:26:50,705 --> 01:26:53,902
is get rid of him before the Chief arrives.

1984
01:26:54,108 --> 01:26:56,042
Otherwise we're all done for.
And you, too.

1985
01:26:56,878 --> 01:27:00,006
Once the stomach cramps start, that's it!

1986
01:27:00,215 --> 01:27:02,615
To hell with you! Cursing me to die!

1987
01:27:02,817 --> 01:27:03,511
Damn you, Fat Chai!

1988
01:27:04,953 --> 01:27:06,443
Get your friend out of here immediately.

1989
01:27:06,654 --> 01:27:09,122
You mean you won't help a dying man?

1990
01:27:09,324 --> 01:27:10,552
Alright, alright. You win.

1991
01:27:11,326 --> 01:27:11,815
Here's some money.

1992
01:27:12,026 --> 01:27:13,755
Take him to see another doctor.

1993
01:27:14,729 --> 01:27:15,127
Go! Go!

1994
01:27:15,330 --> 01:27:16,888
Fat Chai! Take your friend now and go!

1995
01:27:17,865 --> 01:27:18,832
OK, I'm moving out.

1996
01:27:21,803 --> 01:27:26,900
Dr Kim, that was a really good idea!

1997
01:27:27,308 --> 01:27:28,900
We really must thank you.

1998
01:27:29,844 --> 01:27:31,311
My idea's not bad?

1999
01:27:31,512 --> 01:27:32,570
It's great!

2000
01:27:32,780 --> 01:27:36,341
Make way! Make way! Contagion!

2001
01:27:37,151 --> 01:27:38,015
What's the matter?

2002
01:27:39,254 --> 01:27:40,221
Fo heaven's sake don't go in!

2003
01:27:40,421 --> 01:27:41,649
There's a cholera victim!

2004
01:27:41,856 --> 01:27:43,084
We must move him out

2005
01:27:43,291 --> 01:27:45,225
before the Police Chief arrives.

2006
01:27:45,727 --> 01:27:46,591
But I came to tell you

2007
01:27:46,794 --> 01:27:48,819
his palanquin's has just arrived outside.

2008
01:27:49,397 --> 01:27:52,491
Make way!

2009
01:27:52,867 --> 01:27:54,391
Ah Bing, what do we do now?

2010
01:27:56,437 --> 01:27:57,768
Fat Chai, get your friend inside quickly!

2011
01:27:58,172 --> 01:27:59,799
Are you waiting for
the Chief's palanquin?

2012
01:28:01,509 --> 01:28:04,137
Inside!

2013
01:28:04,345 --> 01:28:06,836
What if the Police Chief finds out?

2014
01:28:07,048 --> 01:28:08,982
If he knows there's cholera here, it's over.

2015
01:28:09,951 --> 01:28:11,816
Listen everybody. When the Chief comes,

2016
01:28:12,020 --> 01:28:13,817
don't anyone mention the word cholera!

2017
01:28:14,022 --> 01:28:15,421
I'll shoot anyone who does!

2018
01:28:16,291 --> 01:28:17,087
Do I make myself clear?

2019
01:28:20,094 --> 01:28:22,858
Ah Bing, I may be imagining it,

2020
01:28:23,564 --> 01:28:25,259
but my stomach hurts.

2021
01:28:25,867 --> 01:28:26,799
Ah Pat,

2022
01:28:27,001 --> 01:28:28,400
this is no time for jokes!

2023
01:28:28,703 --> 01:28:30,170
The Police Chief!

2024
01:28:42,250 --> 01:28:43,877
Salute!

2025
01:28:44,218 --> 01:28:45,810
Mr Police Chief son-in-law.

2026
01:28:55,096 --> 01:28:56,085
Please sit down.

2027
01:29:01,436 --> 01:29:04,166
Good morning. Police Chief son-in-law.

2028
01:29:05,540 --> 01:29:08,532
My greetings, Sir and Madam.

2029
01:29:11,579 --> 01:29:14,878
Officer, what did I use to call the others?

2030
01:29:16,050 --> 01:29:18,245
You called them Daddy and Mommy.

2031
01:29:21,189 --> 01:29:24,352
Daddy, Mommy, Good morning.

2032
01:29:24,826 --> 01:29:27,351
Our master greets Sir and Madam.

2033
01:29:28,162 --> 01:29:29,527
Good, good.

2034
01:29:29,731 --> 01:29:32,359
See how polite our son-in-law is.

2035
01:29:33,101 --> 01:29:33,863
What's your name?

2036
01:29:34,202 --> 01:29:36,102
I...I'm called Ah Yin.

2037
01:29:37,405 --> 01:29:38,099
Ah Yin,

2038
01:29:38,306 --> 01:29:40,297
come up with me to help the bride change.

2039
01:29:41,843 --> 01:29:42,867
Please.

2040
01:29:44,379 --> 01:29:45,471
My stomach hurts!

2041
01:29:48,449 --> 01:29:51,714
Dear wife, my stomach hurts!

2042
01:29:51,919 --> 01:29:55,377
I...I can't hold it in!

2043
01:29:55,656 --> 01:29:57,055
Quick, go home!

2044
01:30:03,097 --> 01:30:05,827
Quick, go home!

2045
01:30:09,237 --> 01:30:10,226
My stomach hurts!

2046
01:30:10,438 --> 01:30:11,336
How do you feel?

2047
01:30:11,539 --> 01:30:12,699
I must go to the toilet.

2048
01:30:13,074 --> 01:30:14,564
Carry me. Carry me.

2049
01:30:24,252 --> 01:30:25,344
Hurry!

2050
01:30:26,020 --> 01:30:28,147
What's the matter? What's going on?

2051
01:30:29,424 --> 01:30:31,858
Nothing, Police Chief son-in-law.

2052
01:30:32,059 --> 01:30:33,321
Absolutely nothing.

2053
01:30:36,063 --> 01:30:37,428
I...

2054
01:30:43,704 --> 01:30:45,433
Coming down

2055
01:30:45,973 --> 01:30:47,873
Ah Bing! Why did you lock the door?

2056
01:30:49,710 --> 01:30:52,304
Master, could it be that thing?

2057
01:30:53,748 --> 01:30:55,943
I hope not. Officer! -Yes Sir!

2058
01:30:57,151 --> 01:30:58,914
You have one minute to find out

2059
01:30:59,120 --> 01:31:00,553
what's going on here. -Yes Sir.

2060
01:31:02,690 --> 01:31:05,716
Old man! -Who? Me?

2061
01:31:06,160 --> 01:31:06,990
Who else but you?

2062
01:31:09,330 --> 01:31:10,991
Old man, you have 30 seconds

2063
01:31:11,199 --> 01:31:12,564
to tell me what's going on here.

2064
01:31:13,401 --> 01:31:15,665
I can't tell you. Ah Bing told us

2065
01:31:15,870 --> 01:31:18,134
not to mention the word "cholera".
cholera

2066
01:31:18,906 --> 01:31:19,463
Cholera?

2067
01:31:21,709 --> 01:31:22,607
You old bastard!

2068
01:31:22,810 --> 01:31:25,176
Who has cholera? Who has diarrhea?

2069
01:31:25,379 --> 01:31:26,846
I...have...

2070
01:31:30,852 --> 01:31:31,876
Damn you Ah Bing!

2071
01:31:34,288 --> 01:31:36,620
If you're smart, you'll tell the truth.

2072
01:31:37,191 --> 01:31:39,125
If you don't,

2073
01:31:39,327 --> 01:31:41,124
I'll have you imprisoned for life.

2074
01:31:41,796 --> 01:31:42,763
Imprisoned for life?

2075
01:31:43,531 --> 01:31:44,998
Ah Bing, I've got to tell him.

2076
01:31:48,069 --> 01:31:49,263
Stand back, stand back.

2077
01:31:50,071 --> 01:31:51,800
Is here all right? -Yes. Speak!

2078
01:31:52,273 --> 01:31:53,240
It's like this. This morning

2079
01:31:53,441 --> 01:31:55,306
someon came down with cholera.

2080
01:31:55,877 --> 01:31:57,708
We wanted to move him away

2081
01:31:57,912 --> 01:31:59,675
but you were to become a father-in-law,

2082
01:32:00,348 --> 01:32:01,815
No, no, I mean a bridegroom,

2083
01:32:02,483 --> 01:32:04,508
so the patient's still in my room.

2084
01:32:05,553 --> 01:32:06,383
369!

2085
01:32:06,587 --> 01:32:07,918
369! -Yes Sir!

2086
01:32:09,724 --> 01:32:12,488
You have 1 minute to remove the patient.

2087
01:32:12,693 --> 01:32:13,284
Yes Sir!

2088
01:32:17,565 --> 01:32:18,725
Fat Chai, you do it.

2089
01:32:19,200 --> 01:32:20,132
I can't move him without your help.

2090
01:32:27,141 --> 01:32:29,006
Careful! It's contagious!

2091
01:32:29,644 --> 01:32:32,408
Don't even look. Take his legs.

2092
01:32:35,950 --> 01:32:36,746
Another thing.

2093
01:32:37,318 --> 01:32:39,047
If your stomach hurts, go see a doctor.

2094
01:32:39,253 --> 01:32:39,981
Otherwise, you're done for!

2095
01:32:40,187 --> 01:32:41,381
Thank you. Thank you.

2096
01:32:42,690 --> 01:32:44,021
Ready? -Ready.

2097
01:32:46,427 --> 01:32:47,553
Fat Chai, go as far away as you can.

2098
01:32:47,895 --> 01:32:48,759
I know, Mrs Han.

2099
01:32:49,063 --> 01:32:49,961
Goodbye. -Goodbye.

2100
01:32:50,164 --> 01:32:51,222
Hurry. Go!

2101
01:32:52,433 --> 01:32:52,899
Goodbye!

2102
01:32:53,100 --> 01:32:55,159
Hurry up, Fat Chai! Hurry!

2103
01:32:58,139 --> 01:32:58,764
Take a look at Pat Koo!

2104
01:32:59,040 --> 01:33:00,371
Hurry! -Yes, I know.

2105
01:33:01,008 --> 01:33:02,475
Goodbye, everyone. Goodbye.

2106
01:33:02,677 --> 01:33:05,475
Goodbye.

2107
01:33:05,680 --> 01:33:06,942
Fat Chai, hurry up and take him outside.

2108
01:33:07,148 --> 01:33:08,206
You want to wait for the palanquin?

2109
01:33:08,516 --> 01:33:10,074
What a nice thoght! Goodbye.

2110
01:33:10,284 --> 01:33:13,720
Goodbye.

2111
01:33:16,023 --> 01:33:18,048
147, 258. -Sir!

2112
01:33:20,828 --> 01:33:21,385
What's the matter?

2113
01:33:21,596 --> 01:33:22,494
An order from the Chief.

2114
01:33:22,697 --> 01:33:24,460
Throw away everything
inside this blanket.

2115
01:33:24,665 --> 01:33:25,529
What is this?

2116
01:33:25,733 --> 01:33:27,132
Silverware and antiques?

2117
01:33:27,668 --> 01:33:28,862
How can there be so much of it?

2118
01:33:29,070 --> 01:33:30,435
It's a cholera victim.

2119
01:33:31,305 --> 01:33:32,203
Are you moving him or not?

2120
01:33:32,640 --> 01:33:34,130
If not, I'll take him back.
-We're moving!

2121
01:33:34,342 --> 01:33:38,711
Who says we're not? Pedicab!

2122
01:33:40,381 --> 01:33:41,075
You calling me?

2123
01:33:41,515 --> 01:33:42,607
Of course I'm calling you.

2124
01:33:42,817 --> 01:33:43,806
What's the matter?

2125
01:33:44,151 --> 01:33:45,448
We're requisitioning your cab.

2126
01:33:45,653 --> 01:33:47,177
Take all this as far away as possible.

2127
01:33:47,388 --> 01:33:48,013
Take all this as far away as possible.

2128
01:33:48,222 --> 01:33:49,052
Okay, but money first.

2129
01:33:49,690 --> 01:33:50,281
What are you saying?

2130
01:33:50,491 --> 01:33:52,049
Money? We're requisitioning your cab!

2131
01:33:52,727 --> 01:33:54,558
No money! Who do you think you are?

2132
01:33:55,196 --> 01:33:57,027
Shut up.
I can charge you with obstructing

2133
01:33:57,231 --> 01:33:59,392
a police officer in the course of his duty.

2134
01:34:00,234 --> 01:34:01,326
Are you trying to bully me?

2135
01:34:01,636 --> 01:34:02,466
How many fathers have you got?

2136
01:34:02,670 --> 01:34:03,967
Buddy, my friend has cholera.

2137
01:34:04,171 --> 01:34:06,366
Get us to the hospital quick, please!

2138
01:34:06,574 --> 01:34:08,405
Cholera? Why didn't you say so earlier?

2139
01:34:08,743 --> 01:34:10,005
The sooner you take him...

2140
01:34:10,444 --> 01:34:11,001
How much?

2141
01:34:11,212 --> 01:34:12,110
I don't charge for saving lives.

2142
01:34:12,446 --> 01:34:13,435
You think I'm like them?

2143
01:34:13,648 --> 01:34:15,172
Can't wait for an ambulance. Let's go.

2144
01:34:16,517 --> 01:34:17,779
What are you blabbering about?

2145
01:34:17,985 --> 01:34:19,577
Do you want me to write you a ticket?

2146
01:34:20,955 --> 01:34:23,014
Dammit!
Why do so many people hate us?

2147
01:34:26,260 --> 01:34:27,557
Have they gone, Ah Bing?

2148
01:34:27,928 --> 01:34:28,860
Yes, I got rid of them.

2149
01:34:29,697 --> 01:34:31,392
Salute! Reporting, Chief!

2150
01:34:31,599 --> 01:34:32,759
I requisitioned a pedicab

2151
01:34:32,967 --> 01:34:34,559
and sent them as far away as possible.

2152
01:34:36,971 --> 01:34:39,030
Police Chief son-in-law.

2153
01:34:39,240 --> 01:34:40,969
Shall I tell my daughter
to get dressed now?

2154
01:34:41,175 --> 01:34:41,903
Hurry up!

2155
01:34:42,243 --> 01:34:43,210
I've ordered over 100 tables

2156
01:34:43,411 --> 01:34:45,402
for the wedding banquet.

2157
01:34:45,880 --> 01:34:47,245
Hurry, hurry.

2158
01:34:52,019 --> 01:34:52,883
What are we going to do now?

2159
01:34:53,187 --> 01:34:54,654
It's OK. We're almost at the train station.

2160
01:34:54,855 --> 01:34:55,514
Really?

2161
01:34:59,860 --> 01:35:03,523
Ah Heung...

2162
01:35:06,634 --> 01:35:11,799
Oh my goodness, Ah Pat!

2163
01:35:12,006 --> 01:35:12,904
What's wrong with you?

2164
01:35:13,207 --> 01:35:14,640
Ah Heung's gone!

2165
01:35:15,076 --> 01:35:16,771
Ah Bing, what did you just say?

2166
01:35:16,977 --> 01:35:20,174
Don't scare me, I'm going to faint.

2167
01:35:21,449 --> 01:35:22,780
You can't faint now!

2168
01:35:22,983 --> 01:35:24,143
If that's a joke, it's not funny!

2169
01:35:24,919 --> 01:35:27,285
I've over 100 tables of guests
at the restaurant.

2170
01:35:27,922 --> 01:35:29,287
That's a lot of gifts. -I know.

2171
01:35:32,126 --> 01:35:35,857
You beggars!
Has anyone seen Ah Heung?

2172
01:35:36,063 --> 01:35:36,791
I saw her.

2173
01:35:38,766 --> 01:35:39,460
Where?

2174
01:35:40,534 --> 01:35:41,398
Right here.

2175
01:35:41,969 --> 01:35:42,560
When?

2176
01:35:43,003 --> 01:35:43,731
Last night.

2177
01:35:44,004 --> 01:35:45,028
Damn you!

2178
01:35:45,673 --> 01:35:47,334
369. -369.

2179
01:35:50,544 --> 01:35:53,775
I'm...Here. What...is it, Chief?

2180
01:35:53,981 --> 01:35:54,845
I'm telling you.

2181
01:35:55,182 --> 01:35:57,707
If you don't find the bride today,

2182
01:35:59,720 --> 01:36:01,449
start worrying about your stripes.

2183
01:36:01,655 --> 01:36:03,282
What will happen to my stripes?

2184
01:36:03,891 --> 01:36:05,188
You'll get them inyour next life.

2185
01:36:07,628 --> 01:36:09,653
I can tell you where Ah Heung is.

2186
01:36:09,864 --> 01:36:11,024
Where?

2187
01:36:11,232 --> 01:36:12,927
Didn't you hear Pat Koo say
a few days ago

2188
01:36:13,134 --> 01:36:15,625
she was selling her to Hangchow
as a whore?

2189
01:36:17,571 --> 01:36:18,629
You bastard!

2190
01:36:19,039 --> 01:36:19,937
You want to assault me as well?

2191
01:36:20,574 --> 01:36:23,134
You're making money
twice on your daughter!

2192
01:36:23,878 --> 01:36:25,106
Officers! -Officers!

2193
01:36:25,746 --> 01:36:27,771
Arrest both of them.

2194
01:36:27,982 --> 01:36:29,950
Arrest both of them. -Yes sir!

2195
01:36:30,751 --> 01:36:31,479
Ah Pat!

2196
01:36:33,154 --> 01:36:34,678
Police Chief son-in-law!

2197
01:36:34,889 --> 01:36:36,789
don't listen to those bastards.

2198
01:36:37,958 --> 01:36:42,258
Look at me. I look like a bodhisattva.

2199
01:36:43,063 --> 01:36:45,293
How can I be a bad person?

2200
01:36:46,267 --> 01:36:48,167
Plus you're such devastatingly handsome,

2201
01:36:48,369 --> 01:36:49,666
it's not just Ah Heung
who wants to wed you,

2202
01:36:49,870 --> 01:36:51,599
even I want to marry you myself!

2203
01:36:51,806 --> 01:36:53,103
Ah Pat, Ah Pat.

2204
01:36:53,440 --> 01:36:55,135
Wait a minute.

2205
01:36:57,511 --> 01:36:58,273
Officer.

2206
01:36:58,679 --> 01:37:01,375
Since I need a bride tonight anyway,

2207
01:37:01,582 --> 01:37:03,447
this one's not too bad.

2208
01:37:03,851 --> 01:37:05,443
But she's your mother-in-law!

2209
01:37:05,920 --> 01:37:07,012
I've never tried one before.

2210
01:37:07,755 --> 01:37:11,782
I might as well give her a go. -Yes Sir

2211
01:37:12,660 --> 01:37:14,685
Palanquin! -Yes Sir!

2212
01:37:14,895 --> 01:37:16,123
Help!

2213
01:37:16,330 --> 01:37:17,627
Ah pat!

2214
01:37:20,801 --> 01:37:21,790
Don't try to get away!

2215
01:37:26,006 --> 01:37:26,973
Let's go!
