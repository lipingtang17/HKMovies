1
00:00:25,325 --> 00:00:26,519
All these years.

2
00:00:26,593 --> 00:00:30,154
I've written so many books
with fantastic themes.

3
00:00:30,663 --> 00:00:31,789
Everyone that sees me will ask.

4
00:00:31,998 --> 00:00:34,134
how can you come out all these?

5
00:00:34,134 --> 00:00:35,624
Is it real story?

6
00:00:36,169 --> 00:00:39,400
This is a stupid question

7
00:00:39,539 --> 00:00:41,734
Everyone, in everyday.

8
00:00:41,775 --> 00:00:43,640
there are a lot happen around you.

9
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:45,302
Every tiny little thing.

10
00:00:45,545 --> 00:00:48,309
if you wish you dig up.

11
00:00:48,348 --> 00:00:51,284
it may come out with a fantastic story

12
00:00:51,284 --> 00:00:56,022
If you hang out with your friends.

13
00:00:56,022 --> 00:00:59,048
you may find out many interesting stories

14
00:00:59,159 --> 00:01:01,593
thru their talk.

15
00:01:01,661 --> 00:01:04,755
Tonight, for instance.
two of my friends are here.

16
00:01:05,331 --> 00:01:06,593
Wesley

17
00:01:06,633 --> 00:01:07,622
Mr, Ngai

18
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:09,395
Hello, where's Yuan Chen?

19
00:01:09,502 --> 00:01:10,403
He's over there.

20
00:01:10,403 --> 00:01:11,631
You've got nice glasses

21
00:01:12,138 --> 00:01:13,127
Mr, Ngai

22
00:01:13,373 --> 00:01:15,075
Congratulations on winning
the titles of Miss Asia.

23
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:19,034
Thanks
Cheers.

24
00:01:21,247 --> 00:01:23,340
Yuan Chen, you had a daring adventure

25
00:01:23,383 --> 00:01:25,010
with Wesley, didn't you?

26
00:01:25,185 --> 00:01:27,050
Really? Tell us about it

27
00:01:27,587 --> 00:01:29,487
Mr, Ngai is a good story teller.

28
00:01:29,522 --> 00:01:30,682
Let him tell it

29
00:01:31,291 --> 00:01:35,057
A good story, starts from
a good glass of wine.

30
00:02:13,366 --> 00:02:16,028
Hound calling Thunderbird

31
00:02:16,069 --> 00:02:18,367
Are all units ready?

32
00:02:18,738 --> 00:02:20,535
I'm Thunderbird There are 6 bandits.

33
00:02:20,673 --> 00:02:22,163
One of them is a sharpshooter

34
00:02:22,375 --> 00:02:24,172
They all carry heavy weapons.

35
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:25,677
Tell everyone to be alert.

36
00:02:27,447 --> 00:02:29,506
What's up there, Hound?

37
00:02:40,426 --> 00:02:42,587
Hound, how are you, Hound?

38
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:44,831
Stop fire!

39
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:46,423
You all listen.

40
00:02:47,233 --> 00:02:48,757
you gunned down a hostage!

41
00:02:49,335 --> 00:02:51,633
He's having a serious heart attack.

42
00:02:51,738 --> 00:02:55,003
If the doctor doesn't come, he'll be dead!

43
00:02:56,209 --> 00:02:57,574
The doctor is on his way

44
00:02:57,644 --> 00:02:59,305
You have been surrounded

45
00:02:59,445 --> 00:03:03,006
You stand no chance of escape, Give up!

46
00:03:11,257 --> 00:03:12,091
What is it?

47
00:03:12,091 --> 00:03:13,080
Miss.

48
00:03:14,227 --> 00:03:15,421
I'm the reporter of Western Daily.

49
00:03:15,528 --> 00:03:18,827
We know But it's dangerous
so you can't get in

50
00:03:19,132 --> 00:03:22,295
Please, I just wanna take a picture.
No way!

51
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:24,329
What now, Wonder Woman?

52
00:03:24,637 --> 00:03:25,763
They don't let me in

53
00:03:27,674 --> 00:03:29,301
I'm Doctor Yuan Are you Captain Ho?

54
00:03:29,442 --> 00:03:32,240
The hostage is inside, He has heart attack

55
00:03:32,812 --> 00:03:34,677
Why have to be me?
Well.

56
00:03:34,714 --> 00:03:36,649
We have heard

57
00:03:36,649 --> 00:03:37,684
a lot your bravery

58
00:03:37,684 --> 00:03:39,481
We hope you can go in to plant a bomb

59
00:03:39,552 --> 00:03:41,520
to help us save the hostage

60
00:03:42,455 --> 00:03:43,683
I don't know what to do.

61
00:03:43,756 --> 00:03:44,757
Inspector Kong

62
00:03:44,757 --> 00:03:46,281
Yes, sir.

63
00:03:48,161 --> 00:03:50,721
Dr,Yuan, I'll be the nurse to follow you in.

64
00:03:50,997 --> 00:03:51,764
I'll defuse it

65
00:03:51,764 --> 00:03:53,231
Go and prepare everything
Yes!

66
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:21,723
The bomb is in a layer of the first aid kit.

67
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:23,490
How is everything? OK?

68
00:04:26,366 --> 00:04:28,732
Dr, Yuan, remember, it's 1 2 o'clock sharp.

69
00:04:28,768 --> 00:04:30,633
We'll break in at that time

70
00:04:39,045 --> 00:04:42,640
The doctor's here, Don't open fire

71
00:05:15,648 --> 00:05:16,637
Scatter!

72
00:05:18,484 --> 00:05:20,145
Freeze!
Bitch, don't move

73
00:05:20,486 --> 00:05:24,547

74
00:05:28,061 --> 00:05:29,085
Go!

75
00:05:45,578 --> 00:05:47,705

76
00:05:48,781 --> 00:05:49,682
Where's the patient?

77
00:05:49,682 --> 00:05:55,018
Get up, go!

78
00:05:57,156 --> 00:05:58,180
Gimme the stethoscope

79
00:05:59,058 --> 00:06:01,253
Calm down, I'm a doctor

80
00:06:30,089 --> 00:06:32,421
The heart-stimulant injection

81
00:06:35,628 --> 00:06:36,652
What are you doing?

82
00:06:39,031 --> 00:06:40,430
Brother, a gun!

83
00:06:44,771 --> 00:06:46,238
Bloody kid, you dare to fool me?

84
00:06:48,508 --> 00:06:49,805
Start!

85
00:07:35,021 --> 00:07:36,352
Stop!

86
00:08:19,298 --> 00:08:20,287
Who are you?

87
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:21,993
I'm a reporter

88
00:08:22,602 --> 00:08:24,399
Don't you know that you nearly ruined us?

89
00:08:24,704 --> 00:08:25,728
I'm sorry

90
00:08:26,205 --> 00:08:28,139
Where's my camer?
I wanna take some pictures.

91
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:29,334
You still wanna take pictures?

92
00:08:29,542 --> 00:08:31,271
Thank you, Dr, Yuan

93
00:08:31,377 --> 00:08:32,742
We are now in control.

94
00:08:34,313 --> 00:08:36,716
Good, I gotta go now.
OK, retreat

95
00:08:36,716 --> 00:08:37,705
Yes!

96
00:08:43,256 --> 00:08:44,689
Are you gonna arrest me?

97
00:08:44,724 --> 00:08:46,158
I've seen many pretty girls.

98
00:08:46,158 --> 00:08:47,591
None is crazy like you

99
00:08:47,793 --> 00:08:49,693
Don't you know that you may get in jail?

100
00:08:49,795 --> 00:08:51,558
That
Go now

101
00:08:52,098 --> 00:08:53,463
Thank you

102
00:08:59,138 --> 00:09:01,038
Dr, Yuan, thank you

103
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:02,265
Not a problem.

104
00:09:02,341 --> 00:09:03,399
Captain Ho.

105
00:09:03,509 --> 00:09:06,000
We have to thank
lnspector Kong for just now

106
00:09:07,246 --> 00:09:08,508
Captain Ho!

107
00:09:16,622 --> 00:09:19,292
Ain't you that sexology writer Dr, Chor?
Danny Wong?

108
00:09:19,292 --> 00:09:21,561
I've heard that you have
been writing an essay

109
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:25,429
on the climate's effect
on male sex potential?

110
00:09:25,598 --> 00:09:28,328
This is merely a ratio in Mathematics.

111
00:09:28,668 --> 00:09:31,068
The temperature and time constitute a ratio.

112
00:09:32,038 --> 00:09:34,802
The length is one hour in tropical South

113
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:36,508
Half an hour in the central part

114
00:09:36,676 --> 00:09:40,510
About 2-3 minutes in
the low-temperature North.

115
00:09:42,181 --> 00:09:44,149
I remember you come from
the South Sea lsland.

116
00:09:44,183 --> 00:09:45,514
According to your theory.

117
00:09:45,551 --> 00:09:46,711
I should have come from North Pole.

118
00:09:46,786 --> 00:09:48,583
Really?

119
00:09:53,626 --> 00:09:55,389
There are some pretty chicks there

120
00:09:55,561 --> 00:09:59,131
Dr, Chor, take the wine.

121
00:09:59,131 --> 00:10:01,361
Leave me the girl.

122
00:10:02,768 --> 00:10:05,236
Is it fun?
It's funny

123
00:10:05,404 --> 00:10:06,803
Do you believe in constellation?

124
00:10:07,139 --> 00:10:08,731
I can readily see you must be a Virgo.

125
00:10:09,041 --> 00:10:12,704
Well, take your time.
Annie, let's sit over there

126
00:10:12,745 --> 00:10:14,146
A Virgo girl's best mate is a Taurus guy.

127
00:10:14,146 --> 00:10:16,444
just like me You must be Cancer.

128
00:10:16,549 --> 00:10:18,210
I have quite a lotta collections.

129
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:20,479
A human head made by the New Guinea tribe.

130
00:10:20,653 --> 00:10:22,450
It was shrunk to the size of a monkey head

131
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:24,551
It sounds horrible

132
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:28,582
And, there are some toes
chopped down by alien

133
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:32,198
so nasty, what else?

134
00:10:32,198 --> 00:10:35,224
And me, Yuan Chan.

135
00:10:36,669 --> 00:10:38,569
I have something important to talk to you

136
00:10:38,604 --> 00:10:39,696
What the heck are you doing?

137
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:44,073
Miss, don't be fooled by him.

138
00:10:44,243 --> 00:10:47,178
Lemme be honest to you, he's married.

139
00:10:47,613 --> 00:10:49,513
What are you talking about?

140
00:10:49,749 --> 00:10:52,775
Please excuse me a while.

141
00:10:53,019 --> 00:10:55,419
Bye.
Annie!

142
00:10:55,454 --> 00:10:56,716
You stay.

143
00:10:56,756 --> 00:10:57,814
What on earth do you exactly want?

144
00:10:58,724 --> 00:11:01,727
Sorry, I know I have screwed up your plan

145
00:11:01,727 --> 00:11:03,524
But I need you on something important.

146
00:11:04,597 --> 00:11:05,531
Shoot!

147
00:11:05,531 --> 00:11:09,160
I'd like to feature you in Western Daily

148
00:11:09,201 --> 00:11:10,793
to introduce your heroic deeds.

149
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:12,264
I'll take a naked photo of you

150
00:11:15,641 --> 00:11:17,836
I promise you that it will
have a sense of beauty

151
00:11:18,044 --> 00:11:20,478
My technique is not bad, Trust me

152
00:11:22,048 --> 00:11:23,572
Sorry, it's not my fault It's that guy,,.

153
00:11:23,616 --> 00:11:24,981
Idiot!

154
00:11:38,764 --> 00:11:40,163
Idiot!

155
00:11:42,635 --> 00:11:44,398
Stop!
Sayonara!

156
00:11:55,448 --> 00:11:56,676
Hi.

157
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:07,557
Idiot, I thought I couldn't catcha

158
00:12:32,985 --> 00:12:36,011
You such a bloody nasty bastard!

159
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,582
I'm sorry

160
00:13:43,155 --> 00:13:44,486
You really hurt me

161
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:48,293
How did you get in? Where's Maria?

162
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:51,657
I gave her $1 000 and said
you let her have a day off.

163
00:13:53,065 --> 00:13:54,054
Oh, I see

164
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:03,131
I've fooled by woman all night.

165
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:50,746
Yuan Chan!

166
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:52,150
Who are you?

167
00:14:52,291 --> 00:14:53,553
You have to follow me back to Thailand

168
00:14:53,692 --> 00:14:56,092
You have to help yourself and Betsy

169
00:14:56,228 --> 00:14:57,252
What are you talking about?

170
00:14:58,297 --> 00:15:00,492
Your blood spell has reached one year

171
00:15:00,799 --> 00:15:02,266
You will soon relapse

172
00:15:02,534 --> 00:15:05,094
Betsy got a ghost spell as well

173
00:15:05,237 --> 00:15:07,000
We need your help.

174
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:09,732
I don't understand what
you are talking about

175
00:15:09,775 --> 00:15:13,040
Stop acting, This is my address in Thailand.

176
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:14,272
I'll wait for you three days

177
00:15:16,615 --> 00:15:17,639
Don't go away

178
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:21,443
What's your name?

179
00:15:23,656 --> 00:15:25,089
My name is Black Dragon

180
00:15:26,525 --> 00:15:28,652
Listen, keep away from sex

181
00:15:29,228 --> 00:15:31,253
Or you may have a quick relapse

182
00:15:37,102 --> 00:15:40,003
Who's that guy? I'm so scared

183
00:15:40,239 --> 00:15:42,002
That's alright, No problem.

184
00:16:40,132 --> 00:16:43,624
Mr, Wai, you're my best friend and master

185
00:16:44,303 --> 00:16:45,793
I think only you can help me.

186
00:16:47,373 --> 00:16:48,635
Have you ever been to North Thailand?

187
00:16:50,776 --> 00:16:53,301
So, bring us two cups of coffee, please.

188
00:16:53,645 --> 00:16:54,634
Sure.

189
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:59,617
Apparently you have been under blood spell.

190
00:17:06,091 --> 00:17:07,490
Lemme know the detail.

191
00:17:09,261 --> 00:17:10,421
It was like this

192
00:17:11,163 --> 00:17:12,187
About a year ago.

193
00:17:12,398 --> 00:17:14,730
I followed a medical team to North Thailand.

194
00:17:15,467 --> 00:17:18,129
to seek a kind of herbs for treating AlDS

195
00:17:31,116 --> 00:17:32,344
Morning.
Morning.

196
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:37,244
Good morning.

197
00:17:37,656 --> 00:17:38,645
Good morning.

198
00:17:39,591 --> 00:17:43,220
Professor, I'd like to take
a walk about the lake.

199
00:17:44,263 --> 00:17:47,664
Be careful Here's quite near
to Yunnan, Chinese Miao tribe.

200
00:17:47,766 --> 00:17:52,066
They say a kind of worm
tribe specialize in witchcraft

201
00:17:54,139 --> 00:17:57,108
I only believe in science.

202
00:19:20,592 --> 00:19:24,119
Sorry for breaking your gem

203
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:29,127
Never mind I still have spare, Keep this.

204
00:19:29,334 --> 00:19:30,596
Really?
Yes

205
00:19:32,404 --> 00:19:33,701
I have to go.

206
00:19:46,485 --> 00:19:49,010
You should get close to that girl.

207
00:19:49,087 --> 00:19:51,248
Their tribe's cruel

208
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:54,350
and knows witchcraft

209
00:19:57,029 --> 00:20:00,157
Professor, if they cast a spell
to anyone who talks to.

210
00:20:00,766 --> 00:20:02,393
they must be damn busy

211
00:20:04,169 --> 00:20:05,804
Anyways, I'm the team leader

212
00:20:05,804 --> 00:20:10,036
It's my responsibility to protect you guys.

213
00:20:14,479 --> 00:20:15,571
Sounds of the drum?

214
00:20:21,453 --> 00:20:25,321
It comes from the worm
tribe and signal offerings

215
00:20:25,524 --> 00:20:27,492
They are offering to god, eh?

216
00:20:28,594 --> 00:20:30,459
Don't ever go and see it.

217
00:20:30,796 --> 00:20:32,696
We won't!

218
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:57,017
What a big procession!

219
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:10,257
Go over there.

220
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:55,738
It's her

221
00:21:55,814 --> 00:21:57,304
Who?

222
00:21:57,616 --> 00:21:59,017
The girl I saw this afternoon

223
00:21:59,017 --> 00:22:01,315
Which one?
I don't know either

224
00:22:07,059 --> 00:22:09,220
Have you made up your mind?

225
00:22:09,528 --> 00:22:11,018
I won't say YES.

226
00:22:12,464 --> 00:22:15,194
Probably you have been chosen for offering

227
00:22:15,367 --> 00:22:19,827
When Old Ancestor wakes up, you'll die

228
00:22:20,439 --> 00:22:23,738
You deliberately sent
Black Dragon away and picked me

229
00:22:24,076 --> 00:22:26,010
I only love him.

230
00:22:26,111 --> 00:22:27,544
I won't submit.

231
00:22:32,484 --> 00:22:34,008
My guys.

232
00:22:36,221 --> 00:22:40,385
As a previous years.
when Old Ancestor wakes up.

233
00:22:41,159 --> 00:22:47,496
someone honored by God will be chosen.

234
00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:49,483
Betsy is the daughter of the ex-chief.

235
00:23:49,694 --> 00:23:51,321
please don't offer her to God

236
00:23:51,463 --> 00:23:52,760
This is the will of God.

237
00:23:53,064 --> 00:23:54,998
But we have never tried

238
00:24:28,733 --> 00:24:30,758
Anyone else refusing to do this?

239
00:24:40,812 --> 00:24:42,370
Send them to the grave.

240
00:24:56,027 --> 00:24:57,426
I have to rescue her

241
00:24:57,629 --> 00:24:58,663
You kidding?

242
00:24:58,663 --> 00:25:00,790
Are you crazy? You may be killed!

243
00:25:01,066 --> 00:25:03,466
I'll play to the score.
You guys go get the weapon

244
00:25:03,668 --> 00:25:06,102
No
Don't go

245
00:25:07,339 --> 00:25:08,772
What now?
What shall we do now?

246
00:27:21,172 --> 00:27:22,366
Run!

247
00:27:22,607 --> 00:27:25,269
He's our Old Ancestor. He won't die.

248
00:27:25,377 --> 00:27:27,641
Run! Leave me!

249
00:27:28,446 --> 00:27:29,743
I told you to run Just leave me!

250
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:24,098
Help me!

251
00:28:33,678 --> 00:28:35,305
Hurry up!

252
00:29:17,222 --> 00:29:19,986
Intruders! Go and see!

253
00:29:20,024 --> 00:29:21,321
Yes!

254
00:29:27,098 --> 00:29:28,292
Drum sound?

255
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:31,262
He's pursuing you for your intrusion

256
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:33,094
Run!

257
00:29:42,347 --> 00:29:43,336
Professor!

258
00:29:43,381 --> 00:29:45,508
You brought the mess because
you didn't listen to me

259
00:29:45,617 --> 00:29:47,084
Go back to the camp and pack up at once.

260
00:30:34,265 --> 00:30:37,234
Go, quickly.

261
00:30:39,137 --> 00:30:41,105
Besty, Besty!

262
00:30:57,689 --> 00:31:00,055
Get in the car!

263
00:31:57,415 --> 00:32:03,615
You two destroyed the sacrifice
and blasphemed Old Ancestor

264
00:32:05,023 --> 00:32:11,019
I'll punish you behalf of God

265
00:33:01,746 --> 00:33:04,044
Professor, you...

266
00:33:12,690 --> 00:33:15,454
Yuan Chan, help me!

267
00:33:43,554 --> 00:33:46,148
These worms are highly prolific

268
00:33:47,725 --> 00:33:49,327
Don't worry.

269
00:33:49,327 --> 00:33:52,057
I won't use them on you

270
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:14,161
I'm sorry for you guys

271
00:36:14,305 --> 00:36:15,602
Run, quickly!

272
00:36:16,207 --> 00:36:21,144
Don't let them get hold of you Run!

273
00:37:19,270 --> 00:37:22,006
This is my talismanic worm.

274
00:37:22,006 --> 00:37:24,702
I'm using it to help you, but

275
00:37:35,753 --> 00:37:38,347
When I woke up, Betsy was gone.

276
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:41,251
The 7 bloodstains on my body were gone.

277
00:37:41,692 --> 00:37:43,626
So I left alone.

278
00:37:51,235 --> 00:37:54,329
I've been back to HK a year
and nothing happened

279
00:37:54,372 --> 00:37:55,805
But now,,.

280
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:58,606
Black Dragon warned you
Why don't you trust him?

281
00:37:59,577 --> 00:38:03,172
I don't even know him
How do I know what he wants me?

282
00:38:04,248 --> 00:38:05,579
That's right

283
00:38:08,085 --> 00:38:09,416
You guys

284
00:38:10,554 --> 00:38:12,146
What's wrong, Chan?

285
00:38:12,323 --> 00:38:14,291
So, go get the first aid kit.

286
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:18,025
The 2nd blood curst has burst

287
00:38:18,429 --> 00:38:19,726
When did the first burst occur?

288
00:38:20,298 --> 00:38:22,027
More or less the same time.

289
00:38:23,301 --> 00:38:25,792
It means one burst every 24 hour.

290
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:29,171
When it spreads to the heart.
you'll die in 5 days

291
00:38:32,276 --> 00:38:35,006
Mr. Wai, you know witchcraft well.

292
00:38:35,179 --> 00:38:36,578
Is there any chance of survival for me?

293
00:38:38,215 --> 00:38:41,207
Blood curse is the most mysterious.

294
00:38:41,485 --> 00:38:42,782
and complex of its kind in witchcraft.

295
00:38:46,023 --> 00:38:48,048
Betsy used a spell to save you

296
00:38:48,359 --> 00:38:49,724
But it worked for one year only

297
00:38:52,563 --> 00:38:54,758
There must be a reason Black Dragon
wants you go to go Thailand.

298
00:38:55,766 --> 00:38:57,631
You want me to go to Thailand?

299
00:38:58,569 --> 00:39:01,697
Chan,only the doer can undo a damage done.

300
00:39:03,774 --> 00:39:06,538
Ok, I'll go see him tomorrow

301
00:39:06,811 --> 00:39:10,381
Such an exciting thing.
You gotta gimme the scoop on this

302
00:39:10,381 --> 00:39:11,780
You again?

303
00:39:12,249 --> 00:39:15,013
Cousin, you know much about him?

304
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:16,108
Mr. Wai?

305
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:20,416
Chan, Rainbow is Wai's spoiled cousin

306
00:39:20,458 --> 00:39:21,755
Don't be mad

307
00:39:22,093 --> 00:39:23,355
You wanna screw up everything

308
00:39:23,461 --> 00:39:24,826
I know him well

309
00:39:25,429 --> 00:39:28,762
Fine, I don't wanna take your naked photo

310
00:39:29,066 --> 00:39:30,533
Lemme go with you to Thailand, OK?

311
00:39:31,168 --> 00:39:32,294
You think I'm going traveling?

312
00:39:32,336 --> 00:39:35,772
Rainbow, it's serious, You can't go.

313
00:39:36,006 --> 00:39:37,303
You mean I'm not qualified?

314
00:39:37,475 --> 00:39:40,603
I went through fire and water with Dr Yuan.

315
00:39:40,778 --> 00:39:42,143
You agree so?

316
00:39:42,213 --> 00:39:43,475
I won't let you go with me.

317
00:39:45,983 --> 00:39:47,678
Chan, I have something to do tomorrow.

318
00:39:47,718 --> 00:39:48,810
I'll meet you up the day after.

319
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:50,983
Call the Thai police if anything happens.

320
00:39:51,055 --> 00:39:52,317
I'll keep in touch with them.

321
00:39:53,290 --> 00:39:54,091
Thank you

322
00:39:54,091 --> 00:39:54,692
No problem

323
00:39:54,692 --> 00:39:56,751
Cousin, you don't wanna help me?

324
00:39:57,495 --> 00:39:59,429
A reporter shouldn't go too far in coverage.

325
00:39:59,530 --> 00:40:01,157
This is a matter of life and death.

326
00:40:02,366 --> 00:40:05,335
You are only in for kicks, Stay out of it.

327
00:40:17,715 --> 00:40:19,205
Mr. Yuan Chan?

328
00:40:20,050 --> 00:40:20,948
I am.

329
00:40:21,085 --> 00:40:22,450
Please follow me.

330
00:40:23,254 --> 00:40:24,054
You are?

331
00:40:24,054 --> 00:40:26,614
My boss sends me to pick you up
You'll know when you see

332
00:40:45,042 --> 00:40:45,843
Where's your boss?

333
00:40:45,843 --> 00:40:47,478
Mr, Yuan, please take a rest

334
00:40:47,478 --> 00:40:48,467
Thanks

335
00:41:24,315 --> 00:41:25,304
Idiot

336
00:41:25,716 --> 00:41:26,705
You again?

337
00:41:27,351 --> 00:41:28,818
I came on earlier flight

338
00:41:30,588 --> 00:41:31,987
Why there are so many weapons?

339
00:41:32,456 --> 00:41:34,253
We're going to a primitive jungle

340
00:41:34,425 --> 00:41:36,222
It's unsafe without them.

341
00:41:36,794 --> 00:41:39,558
This is the latest laser-guided gun.

342
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,024
Can you afford it?

343
00:41:45,402 --> 00:41:47,131
My dad is Tung Tai Ping.

344
00:41:48,239 --> 00:41:50,070
Property magnate Tung Tai Ping?

345
00:41:50,574 --> 00:41:52,201
I couldn't care less

346
00:41:52,476 --> 00:41:55,445
As long as I have a Gold
card for an unlimited sum

347
00:41:56,447 --> 00:42:00,406
Pretty, nescience, young, hell-bent,,.

348
00:42:00,618 --> 00:42:02,051
and rich.

349
00:42:02,119 --> 00:42:04,314
I think you are the most troublesome
woman in the world

350
00:42:05,022 --> 00:42:07,456
I always pay for into out of my own pocket

351
00:42:08,259 --> 00:42:09,590
We are not going to war

352
00:42:09,994 --> 00:42:13,122
These can't overcome witchcraft.

353
00:42:14,265 --> 00:42:16,028
Let's talk about business

354
00:42:16,634 --> 00:42:18,761
I've already made a promise to the editor

355
00:42:18,802 --> 00:42:20,497
And got in touch with the United Press

356
00:42:20,671 --> 00:42:23,834
If your info can be front-page
in world newspaper.

357
00:42:24,041 --> 00:42:25,474
I'll split half the profit with you

358
00:42:26,243 --> 00:42:27,642
I'm in no mood for your frenzied idea

359
00:42:28,279 --> 00:42:30,713
I don't care, I wanna go with you.

360
00:42:30,981 --> 00:42:32,175
Are you going to tie me up?

361
00:42:34,518 --> 00:42:37,180
Hey, idiot, let me go.

362
00:42:39,189 --> 00:42:40,656
Don't ever underrate a man

363
00:43:33,110 --> 00:43:34,509
You finally come

364
00:43:35,813 --> 00:43:36,837
You seem like

365
00:43:37,381 --> 00:43:39,372
I was being pursued immediately returned.

366
00:43:42,186 --> 00:43:43,244
Who pursued you?

367
00:43:43,654 --> 00:43:46,122
The sorcerer, He knew that I found you.

368
00:43:46,490 --> 00:43:50,119
He conspired with the underworld against us.

369
00:43:50,394 --> 00:43:52,089
They're all of a kind

370
00:43:52,296 --> 00:43:55,493
I was assaulted when I returned.

371
00:43:56,333 --> 00:43:57,595
Let's leave right now.

372
00:45:04,068 --> 00:45:05,467
Is this the worm tribe?

373
00:45:05,536 --> 00:45:09,404
No, it's a good tribe working of farmers.

374
00:45:09,473 --> 00:45:11,771
But they often attacked by the worm tribe.

375
00:45:20,718 --> 00:45:22,652
Dragon, it's good to have you back

376
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:24,654
Chief, what happened?

377
00:45:24,822 --> 00:45:26,619
A weird thing happened.

378
00:45:27,157 --> 00:45:31,093
All kids in the village
disappeared this afternoon.

379
00:45:31,161 --> 00:45:33,026
All disappear?
Yep

380
00:45:35,299 --> 00:45:36,323
What happened?

381
00:45:36,366 --> 00:45:38,266
All kids in our village are disappeared.

382
00:45:38,302 --> 00:45:40,293
It must be the sorcerer have abducted
them for casting Little Ghost Spell

383
00:45:40,370 --> 00:45:41,405
Little Ghost Spell?

384
00:45:41,405 --> 00:45:44,340
Yes, it's made of 1 00 children's blood

385
00:45:44,475 --> 00:45:47,000
They can fly, suck blood and kill people

386
00:45:47,144 --> 00:45:49,213
The spell has to be remade

387
00:45:49,213 --> 00:45:50,544
after three years.

388
00:45:51,181 --> 00:45:52,478
How cruel he is!

389
00:45:52,816 --> 00:45:56,149
Right, I saw the little ghost
on the offering night.

390
00:45:56,620 --> 00:46:00,056
The chief wants me to bring men
to rescue the kids

391
00:46:00,758 --> 00:46:01,692
OK.

392
00:46:01,692 --> 00:46:02,989
I wanna go, too.

393
00:46:21,011 --> 00:46:22,205
It's so quiet tonight.
Yep

394
00:46:22,379 --> 00:46:24,711
Not even chirps
There must be something wrong.

395
00:46:25,048 --> 00:46:26,072
Be careful!

396
00:46:49,406 --> 00:46:50,430
Run quickly!

397
00:46:50,541 --> 00:46:53,101
Don't run Come back!

398
00:47:08,458 --> 00:47:09,686
It hurts!

399
00:47:12,229 --> 00:47:14,663
I told you not to follow.
Don't you know how dangerous is it?

400
00:47:15,165 --> 00:47:17,395
I've already followed you all the way

401
00:47:17,467 --> 00:47:19,765
There's no way not to continue.

402
00:47:22,739 --> 00:47:25,674
Don't you know that there are
many booby-traps here?

403
00:47:26,376 --> 00:47:29,243
Don't worry, I have read quite
many books of Vietcong tactics

404
00:47:29,346 --> 00:47:31,780
when I studied in US

405
00:47:45,295 --> 00:47:49,026
That shows I can take care of myself.

406
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:52,398
Fine, we have to work
against time now, Let's go.

407
00:48:00,544 --> 00:48:02,671
I'll go up and have a look, Keep quiet

408
00:48:05,482 --> 00:48:06,471
Rainbow!

409
00:48:07,017 --> 00:48:07,751
Where are you going?

410
00:48:07,751 --> 00:48:08,685
To take pictures

411
00:48:08,685 --> 00:48:11,745
Rainbow, I have to be responsible
for your safety if you're with me

412
00:48:12,189 --> 00:48:14,123
It's too dangerous I can't let you go

413
00:48:14,224 --> 00:48:16,249
I don't care, What a male chauvinist!

414
00:48:16,293 --> 00:48:18,056
Rainbow, listen.

415
00:48:18,095 --> 00:48:19,722
I've been through this It's too dangerous

416
00:48:19,796 --> 00:48:21,661
Things are beyond your control.

417
00:48:22,466 --> 00:48:23,763
Let go!

418
00:48:24,268 --> 00:48:26,327
I'm telling you, if you touch me again.

419
00:48:26,370 --> 00:48:28,395
I'll tell my cousin you hares me

420
00:48:30,741 --> 00:48:32,776
Though with your reputation.

421
00:48:32,776 --> 00:48:35,802
few people will believe that.

422
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:38,248
I don't care what you say
You have to listen to me

423
00:48:38,348 --> 00:48:40,646
Or I'll spank you without pants

424
00:48:41,051 --> 00:48:42,075
How dare you?

425
00:48:44,154 --> 00:48:45,314
You nasty!

426
00:48:45,589 --> 00:48:46,749
So what?

427
00:48:47,090 --> 00:48:50,491
I won't care about you
I'm leaving now, I won't come back.

428
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:51,822
Up to you

429
00:48:52,195 --> 00:48:55,392
I won't return even if
I were bitten by snakes.

430
00:48:55,499 --> 00:48:57,694
hit by arrows or scared by men!

431
00:48:57,768 --> 00:49:01,534
I won't care for you anymore Don't regret.

432
00:49:05,175 --> 00:49:06,472
You're so cruel hearted

433
00:49:09,746 --> 00:49:10,974
Bye-bye

434
00:49:18,355 --> 00:49:20,084
She's away in a twinkle

435
00:49:22,125 --> 00:49:25,288
The kids are all caged and guarded.

436
00:49:25,495 --> 00:49:27,122
We'd better go and help Betsy first.

437
00:49:27,197 --> 00:49:28,221
OK.

438
00:49:29,166 --> 00:49:30,690
Where's Miss Rainbow?

439
00:49:31,301 --> 00:49:34,270
She got pissed off and she left

440
00:49:34,338 --> 00:49:37,330
Never mind her Where's Betsy?

441
00:49:43,714 --> 00:49:44,738
Betsy?

442
00:49:45,649 --> 00:49:46,673
Dragon.

443
00:49:48,452 --> 00:49:50,113
I've brought back Dr Yuan.

444
00:49:51,188 --> 00:49:53,023
I'm here, Betsy

445
00:49:53,023 --> 00:49:53,790
Don't come over

446
00:49:53,790 --> 00:49:56,054
I don't want anyone to see me now.

447
00:49:57,661 --> 00:50:00,824
Forget it, Her looks scared me

448
00:50:05,335 --> 00:50:08,793
Betsy, the 4th blood curse on me has burst.

449
00:50:09,406 --> 00:50:12,307
We have to figure out how
to save you and me

450
00:50:13,543 --> 00:50:16,273
My dad told me before he died.

451
00:50:16,413 --> 00:50:20,713
Some holy ashes can break
any kinds of spell

452
00:50:21,585 --> 00:50:26,079
I consulted the records of the tribe.

453
00:50:26,490 --> 00:50:28,515
And have found the hiding place.

454
00:50:28,792 --> 00:50:29,726
Where?

455
00:50:29,726 --> 00:50:32,320
A large Buddha in a cave It's out of reach.

456
00:50:32,396 --> 00:50:34,227
No one can climp up.

457
00:50:35,265 --> 00:50:36,630
So they are unobtainable

458
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:39,598
I believe that you're
my saviour from Heaven.

459
00:50:39,736 --> 00:50:42,136
So I sent Dragon to get you

460
00:50:45,542 --> 00:50:46,804
We can have a try

461
00:50:47,244 --> 00:50:50,236
You only have 3 days to live.
No other choice

462
00:50:52,082 --> 00:50:53,276
I'll go telegram them.

463
00:50:53,350 --> 00:50:54,384
Askk them to prepare everything.

464
00:50:54,384 --> 00:50:56,784
Besides, the Ashes will wither in 6 hours

465
00:50:57,087 --> 00:50:58,349
after you take out.

466
00:51:00,223 --> 00:51:04,660
Help! What are you doing? Put me down!

467
00:51:05,262 --> 00:51:07,730
I'll give you money, Release me!

468
00:51:11,401 --> 00:51:12,732
Release me!

469
00:51:15,105 --> 00:51:16,436
Release her.

470
00:51:20,110 --> 00:51:22,806
You must be the boss here.
You're such a nice guy.

471
00:51:23,113 --> 00:51:24,603
I gotta go, bye

472
00:51:29,519 --> 00:51:34,218
I've got the wrong way and been trapped

473
00:51:34,825 --> 00:51:37,385
Did you send by Black Dragon?

474
00:51:38,562 --> 00:51:43,499
No, I'm here to collect specimens

475
00:51:44,634 --> 00:51:47,626
You look handsome.
Lemem take a photo for you

476
00:51:48,305 --> 00:51:49,465
Damn you!

477
00:51:59,683 --> 00:52:01,981
OK, I know Fine Over!

478
00:52:10,260 --> 00:52:11,591
Backup and equipment are coming soon

479
00:52:11,761 --> 00:52:13,092
Rainbow's not back yet.

480
00:52:13,296 --> 00:52:15,059
What takes her so long?

481
00:52:15,265 --> 00:52:16,493
Where 's she been to?

482
00:52:16,666 --> 00:52:20,193
There're 2 possibilities, one is dead.
and one is been caught

483
00:52:23,006 --> 00:52:25,270
If she's been caught, where could she be?

484
00:52:25,375 --> 00:52:28,640
She's an outsider.
must be taken to the sorcerer.

485
00:52:34,317 --> 00:52:35,716
Let's save Betsy first.

486
00:52:36,586 --> 00:52:38,144
Rescue Rainbow.

487
00:52:39,589 --> 00:52:40,613
Good buddy!

488
00:55:26,656 --> 00:55:27,680
Miss Rainbow.

489
00:55:52,315 --> 00:55:54,442
How is her?

490
00:55:55,051 --> 00:55:58,350
Her temperature is weird
But she's not having a fever or cold

491
00:56:00,190 --> 00:56:02,158
Lemme go and see if the backup's arrived

492
00:56:14,671 --> 00:56:15,660
Rainbow!

493
00:56:43,233 --> 00:56:44,100
What happened?

494
00:56:44,100 --> 00:56:45,727
She goes berserk and is herculean

495
00:57:03,420 --> 00:57:06,446
Rainbow, what are you doing?

496
00:57:16,633 --> 00:57:17,622
Catch her!

497
00:57:35,251 --> 00:57:36,445
What happened?

498
00:57:37,787 --> 00:57:39,277
She's caught by the Sorcerer.

499
00:57:39,422 --> 00:57:41,413
Then she's like this after we found her.

500
00:57:42,058 --> 00:57:46,427
I think she must have got the Black Spell.

501
00:57:46,629 --> 00:57:47,721
So she's herculean and wants to kill

502
00:57:48,031 --> 00:57:51,194
How can we break the spell?

503
00:57:51,734 --> 00:57:53,326
Lemme help you.

504
00:57:54,804 --> 00:57:56,294
Betsy?

505
00:58:01,311 --> 00:58:03,370
Black is needed to break a black spell.

506
00:58:03,813 --> 00:58:07,214
Mix the blood of Black sheep, oxen.

507
00:58:07,317 --> 00:58:11,378
dogs, cats, snakes, eagles and lizards.

508
00:58:11,788 --> 00:58:15,485
Boil it and bathe her with it.

509
00:58:15,725 --> 00:58:17,420
Immerse her until she wakes up

510
00:58:57,667 --> 00:58:59,225
Ghost!

511
00:59:05,141 --> 00:59:06,301
What happened?
What's up?

512
00:59:07,777 --> 00:59:09,244
She saw my face

513
00:59:09,779 --> 00:59:10,973
It's OK.

514
00:59:11,614 --> 00:59:13,707
The sorcerer persecuted her like this

515
00:59:14,117 --> 00:59:16,312
She saved you.

516
00:59:17,153 --> 00:59:18,381
She's fine now

517
00:59:19,055 --> 00:59:22,422
Dr, Yuan, there's not much time.
Go find the Ashes?

518
00:59:27,130 --> 00:59:28,154
Black Dragon

519
00:59:29,198 --> 00:59:32,031
No matter if you can find it.
you have to come back

520
00:59:34,070 --> 00:59:35,628
I wanna go with you

521
00:59:35,838 --> 00:59:37,328
Rainbow, be good

522
00:59:38,408 --> 00:59:40,103
Then,,,you have to come back!

523
00:59:49,786 --> 00:59:50,844
What happened?

524
00:59:51,487 --> 00:59:55,287
Mr. Wai, the 6th curse has burst.

525
00:59:55,792 --> 00:59:57,259
Not much bleeding.

526
00:59:58,728 --> 01:00:00,628
But when the 7th bursts.

527
01:00:01,164 --> 01:00:03,758
all your blood will spill out.

528
01:00:06,769 --> 01:00:10,603
Mr, Wai, tomorrow is
the last day of my life

529
01:00:12,175 --> 01:00:16,134
Yuan Chan, I don't believe
in fate can contral a brave man.

530
01:00:16,346 --> 01:00:18,109
I think man conquers fate.

531
01:00:18,348 --> 01:00:19,406
Black Dragon.

532
01:00:19,649 --> 01:00:21,116
what's the name of that sorcerer?

533
01:00:21,250 --> 01:00:22,615
Sorcerer Aquala

534
01:00:23,586 --> 01:00:25,076
Aquala?

535
01:00:25,688 --> 01:00:30,352
The witchcraft of this clan is the most
mysterious and cruel in the South.

536
01:00:30,727 --> 01:00:32,058
Did he practice Little Ghost Spell?

537
01:00:32,228 --> 01:00:33,217
Yes

538
01:00:33,630 --> 01:00:35,427
Get a pregnant cow at once

539
01:00:35,598 --> 01:00:37,566
Slaughter it and get her placenta out.

540
01:00:37,667 --> 01:00:39,430
A black dog as well and get its blood.

541
01:00:39,569 --> 01:00:40,593
Yes!

542
01:00:41,204 --> 01:00:43,069
Wesley, what is it for?

543
01:00:43,573 --> 01:00:46,201
To break the Little Ghost Spell.

544
01:00:46,509 --> 01:00:48,602
a friend of Aquala Clan taught me that

545
01:00:49,145 --> 01:00:50,612
I don't know if it works

546
01:00:52,081 --> 01:00:54,379
Chan, it's all up to yourself.

547
01:00:55,551 --> 01:00:59,487
Old Ancestor, gimme power!

548
01:00:59,756 --> 01:01:04,125
Use the blood power
to turn into blood ghosts

549
01:01:08,197 --> 01:01:11,394
Go kill the guys of Yuan Chan!

550
01:02:02,585 --> 01:02:03,711
Where are those two grains of ashes?

551
01:02:04,654 --> 01:02:06,246
Inside the eyes

552
01:02:11,294 --> 01:02:13,819
We gotta climb up.
do you have problem with it?

553
01:02:14,330 --> 01:02:16,298
Ha, I have even climbed the Himalaya.

554
01:02:27,110 --> 01:02:30,375
They say no one trying it has ever come out.

555
01:02:31,080 --> 01:02:32,172
It all depends on us

556
01:02:51,567 --> 01:02:52,625
Watch out!

557
01:02:54,737 --> 01:02:55,761
Be careful!

558
01:04:56,158 --> 01:04:57,750
Yuan Chan!

559
01:05:17,380 --> 01:05:18,506
Masters.

560
01:05:20,616 --> 01:05:23,414
we try to get them to help someone only.

561
01:05:23,586 --> 01:05:26,054
Please do us a favor, masters.

562
01:07:07,523 --> 01:07:08,512
Run, quick!

563
01:07:29,145 --> 01:07:30,339
Duck it!

564
01:07:43,159 --> 01:07:49,029
Yuan Chan!

565
01:08:20,663 --> 01:08:23,188
Swallow it now to break the blood spell.

566
01:08:34,376 --> 01:08:35,502
Swallow it!

567
01:08:43,452 --> 01:08:45,113
We have to go back in 2 hours.

568
01:08:45,454 --> 01:08:47,513
Or the other grain will become ineffective

569
01:09:20,756 --> 01:09:24,214
Rainbow Betsy have been taken by them.
Go rescue them quickly!

570
01:09:24,627 --> 01:09:27,619
I'll catcha you guys later.

571
01:09:43,012 --> 01:09:45,139
Old Ancestor is so happy today.

572
01:09:45,714 --> 01:09:48,547
To have three men and three girls for food

573
01:09:49,018 --> 01:09:50,417
God will punish you.

574
01:09:51,253 --> 01:09:53,118
Yuan Chan is coming to kill you

575
01:09:56,091 --> 01:09:58,559
I'm waiting for them now.

576
01:09:59,361 --> 01:10:00,658
We are here!

577
01:10:05,100 --> 01:10:06,795
I told you he would come

578
01:10:09,438 --> 01:10:13,238
Old Ancestor!

579
01:10:16,111 --> 01:10:20,377
Aquala, you did many atrocties

580
01:10:20,649 --> 01:10:23,117
I'll make you pay for them now.

581
01:10:32,461 --> 01:10:33,553
Old Ancestor!

582
01:10:40,402 --> 01:10:41,391
Let's go!

583
01:10:51,480 --> 01:10:52,504
Watch out!

584
01:11:55,544 --> 01:11:56,533
Rainbow!

585
01:12:35,351 --> 01:12:36,443
Black Dragon!

586
01:12:43,292 --> 01:12:44,486
Stay aside!

587
01:13:25,567 --> 01:13:27,057
Let loose the Little Ghost!

588
01:15:42,804 --> 01:15:44,237
Where's the grain?

589
01:15:44,740 --> 01:15:45,798
It's here.

590
01:15:49,144 --> 01:15:51,339
Damn, it's over the time.

591
01:15:53,749 --> 01:15:56,445
Betsy can't restore her original looks then

592
01:16:05,727 --> 01:16:08,196
Dragon, would you love me still

593
01:16:08,196 --> 01:16:09,254
if I look like this all my life?

594
01:16:13,135 --> 01:16:17,663
The sorcerer is dead Our tribes
can lead a new life from now on.

595
01:16:18,140 --> 01:16:22,133
I can help them live better.

596
01:16:24,079 --> 01:16:25,410
Isn't that a pity?

597
01:16:25,514 --> 01:16:28,210
Beauty lies on one's heart.

598
01:16:28,283 --> 01:16:29,443
not on one's face
