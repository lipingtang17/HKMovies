1
00:00:25,425 --> 00:00:26,619
那么多年来……
All these years.

2
00:00:26,726 --> 00:00:30,184
我用稀奇古怪的题材 写过那么多古怪的小说
I've written so many books with fantastic themes.

3
00:00:30,797 --> 00:00:31,957
每一个人碰到都问我
Everyone that sees me will ask.

4
00:00:31,998 --> 00:00:34,125
他说，你怎么想像出来的呢？
how can you come out all these?

5
00:00:34,167 --> 00:00:35,759
还是真的经历呢？
Is it real story?

6
00:00:36,169 --> 00:00:39,468
问这个问题 其实是一个很傻的一个问题
This is a stupid question

7
00:00:39,639 --> 00:00:41,869
因为每一个人每一天
Everyone, in everyday.

8
00:00:41,908 --> 00:00:43,739
在你身边发生那么多的事情
there are a lot happen around you.

9
00:00:43,843 --> 00:00:45,367
每一件小事情
Every tiny little thing.

10
00:00:45,645 --> 00:00:48,341
只要你肯去深入发掘的话
if you wish you dig up.

11
00:00:48,381 --> 00:00:51,350
都可以变成一个稀奇古怪的故事
it may come out with a fantastic story

12
00:00:51,384 --> 00:00:56,014
尤其如果你经常跟朋友喝酒聊天的话
If you hang out with your friends.

13
00:00:56,056 --> 00:00:59,048
在每一个人的身上都可以有很多
you may find out many interesting stories

14
00:00:59,192 --> 00:01:01,683
曲折离奇的故事给你发掘出来
thru their talk.

15
00:01:01,795 --> 00:01:04,923
好像今天晚上这样的情形 有两个朋友已经到了
Tonight, for instance. two of my friends are here.

16
00:01:05,398 --> 00:01:06,695

21
00:01:12,172 --> 00:01:13,161

恭喜几位当选亚洲小姐

24
00:01:21,247 --> 00:01:23,408
原振侠，你前一阵子不是跟卫斯理
Yuan Chen, you had a daring adventure

25
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:25,008
有一件很惊险的事情吗？

26
00:01:25,218 --> 00:01:27,083
是吗？说来听听
Really? Tell us about it

27
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,585
倪先生才是最会讲故事的人
Mr, Ngai is a good story teller.

28
00:01:29,622 --> 00:01:30,850
应该由倪先生讲才对
Let him tell it

29
00:01:31,357 --> 00:01:35,088
一个好的故事，从一杯好的酒开始
A good story, starts from a good glass of wine.

30
00:02:13,433 --> 00:02:16,027
猎狗呼叫雷鸟……
Hound calling Thunderbird

31
00:02:16,069 --> 00:02:18,435
各单位准备好了没有……？
Are all units ready?

32
00:02:18,872 --> 00:02:20,601
我是雷鸟，里面有六个劫匪

其中一个是神枪手

他们每个人都有重型武器

35
00:02:24,244 --> 00:02:25,768
吩咐大家小心点

36
00:02:27,514 --> 00:02:29,573
猎狗，你怎么啦？
What's up there, Hound?

37
00:02:40,527 --> 00:02:42,722
猎狗，你怎么啦？猎狗

38
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:44,998
快点停火
Stop fire!

39
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:46,522
下面的人听着
You all listen.

40
00:02:47,267 --> 00:02:48,928
你们开枪打伤了一个人质
you gunned down a hostage!

41
00:02:49,402 --> 00:02:51,768
现在他的心脏病很严重

42
00:02:51,905 --> 00:02:54,999
如果你们的医生还不来，他就死定了

43
00:02:56,242 --> 00:02:57,675

我们已经包围了你们

00:02:59,546 --> 00:03:03,004
你们没有机会逃走了，快点投降吧

46
00:03:11,324 --> 00:03:12,125
什么事？
What is it?

47
00:03:12,125 --> 00:03:13,114
小姐
Miss.

48
00:03:14,294 --> 00:03:15,522
我是西方日报记者
I'm the reporter of Western Daily.

We know But it's dangerous so you can't get in

51
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:24,393

52
00:03:24,771 --> 00:03:25,897
他们不让我进去
They don't let me in

53
00:03:27,807 --> 00:03:29,365
我是原医生，你是何Sir吧？

人质在里面，他向来都有心脏病

55
00:03:32,979 --> 00:03:34,776
为什么一定要找我？    是这样的

56
00:03:34,814 --> 00:03:36,749
我们知道原医生 有过很多冒险的事迹

110
00:09:25,731 --> 00:09:28,393
这只不过是数学上的比例问题

111
00:09:28,801 --> 00:09:31,099
温度跟时间是成正比例的

我是北极人了

118
00:09:46,953 --> 00:09:48,716

125
00:10:09,041 --> 00:10:12,845
好，你慢慢解释吧 安妮，我们到那边坐
Well, take your time. Annie, let's sit over there

126
00:10:12,845 --> 00:10:14,180
你知不知道处女座的女孩 最好找个金牛座的男孩
A Virgo girl's best mate is a Taurus guy.

127
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:16,512
好像我一样，你一定是巨蟹座

133
00:10:29,362 --> 00:10:32,264

134
00:10:32,264 --> 00:10:35,256
还有我罗，原振侠

我有很重要的事要跟你说
I have something important to talk to you

136
00:10:38,704 --> 00:10:39,830
你搞什么鬼？
What the heck are you doing?

137
00:10:41,273 --> 00:10:44,071
小姐，在你还没有被他骗到手之前

你先不要走呀

143
00:10:56,889 --> 00:10:57,981
你现在究竟想怎么样？
What on earth do you exactly want?

144
00:10:58,891 --> 00:11:01,860
对不起呀，我也知道 破坏了你的泡妞计划

145
00:11:01,894 --> 00:11:03,623
不过我有重要事找你

146
00:11:04,697 --> 00:11:05,631
你说吧

00:11:05,631 --> 00:11:09,192

148
00:11:09,235 --> 00:11:10,964
我想介绍一下你的英雄事迹

149
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:12,298
给你拍一辑裸照

My technique is not bad, Trust me

152
00:11:22,048 --> 00:11:23,675
对不起，那位先生，不关我的事……
Sorry, it's not my fault It's that guy,,.

153
00:11:23,716 --> 00:11:25,013
傻瓜
Idiot!

154
00:11:38,898 --> 00:11:40,195
傻瓜

155
00:11:42,768 --> 00:11:44,497

156
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:56,776
嗨
Hi.

157
00:12:04,824 --> 00:12:07,657
傻瓜，我还以为追不上你呢？
Idiot, I thought I couldn't catcha

158
00:12:33,018 --> 00:12:36,044
你这个人真是下流 卑鄙无耻，你是个臭男人
You such a bloody nasty bastard!

159
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:42,717
对不起
I'm sorry

160
00:13:43,189 --> 00:13:44,588
你吓了我一跳
You really hurt me

161
00:13:45,391 --> 00:13:48,360
你怎么进来的？玛莉亚哪儿去了？
How did you get in? Where's Maria?

162
00:13:48,627 --> 00:13:51,824
我给了她一千块钱 还跟她说你放她一天假
I gave her $1 000 and said you let her have a day off.

163
00:13:53,065 --> 00:13:54,054
我明白了
Oh, I see

164
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:03,164
今晚真是给女人玩惨了
I've fooled by woman all night.

165
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:50,913
原振侠
Yuan Chan!

166
00:14:51,023 --> 00:14:52,183
你是谁？
Who are you?

167
00:14:52,358 --> 00:14:53,689
你要跟我回泰国
You have to follow me back to Thailand

168
00:14:53,826 --> 00:14:56,124
你要救自己，还要救芭珠
You have to help yourself and Betsy

169
00:14:56,262 --> 00:14:57,320
你说什么？
What are you talking about?

170
00:14:58,364 --> 00:15:00,628
你身上的血降已经满一年了
Your blood spell has reached one year

171
00:15:00,966 --> 00:15:02,331
很快就会发作
You will soon relapse

172
00:15:02,635 --> 00:15:05,126
芭珠也中了鬼面降
Betsy got a ghost spell as well

173
00:15:05,271 --> 00:15:07,000
我们需要你的帮助
We need your help.

174
00:15:08,173 --> 00:15:09,868
我真的不明白你说什么？
I don't understand what you are talking about

175
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:13,003
你不要装蒜，这是我在泰国的位址
Stop acting, This is my address in Thailand.

176
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:14,306
我等你三天
I'll wait for you three days

177
00:15:16,682 --> 00:15:17,740
先别走
Don't go away

178
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:21,543
你叫什么名字？
What's your name?

179
00:15:23,822 --> 00:15:25,119
我叫黑龙
My name is Black Dragon

180
00:15:26,625 --> 00:15:28,786
听着，千万不要近女色
Listen, keep away from sex

181
00:15:29,295 --> 00:15:31,286
否则即刻会发作
Or you may have a quick relapse

182
00:15:37,136 --> 00:15:40,003
那个人是谁？怎么那么凶？
Who's that guy? I'm so scared

183
00:15:40,306 --> 00:15:42,001
没事，不用怕
That's alright, No problem.

184
00:16:40,132 --> 00:16:43,761
卫先生，你是我最好的朋友 又是我师父
Mr, Wai, you're my best friend and master

185
00:16:44,336 --> 00:16:45,928
我想只有你才能帮我
I think only you can help me.

186
00:16:47,439 --> 00:16:48,770
你去过泰国北部吗？
Have you ever been to North Thailand?

187
00:16:50,909 --> 00:16:53,377
阿素，麻烦你冲两杯咖啡给我们
So, bring us two cups of coffee, please.

188
00:16:53,746 --> 00:16:54,735
好啊
Sure.

189
00:16:56,815 --> 00:16:59,750
你似乎中了巫术之中最厉害的血咒
Apparently you have been under blood spell.

190
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:07,592
我想知道详细情形
Lemme know the detail.

191
00:17:09,328 --> 00:17:10,317
事情是这样的
It was like this

192
00:17:11,196 --> 00:17:12,254
在一年前
About a year ago.

193
00:17:12,464 --> 00:17:14,898
我和一队医学探险队到泰国北部
I followed a medical team to North Thailand.

194
00:17:15,567 --> 00:17:18,161
去找一种医治爱滋病的草药
to seek a kind of herbs for treating AlDS

195
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:32,447
早    早
Morning. Morning.

196
00:17:36,321 --> 00:17:37,345
早
Good morning.

197
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:38,779
早
Good morning.

198
00:17:39,691 --> 00:17:43,252
教授，我想到湖的那边走一走
Professor, I'd like to take a walk about the lake.

199
00:17:44,296 --> 00:17:47,788
你要小心点，这儿接近 中国云南的苗族
Be careful Here's quite near to Yunnan, Chinese Miao tribe.

200
00:17:47,933 --> 00:17:52,063
中泰边境的地方 听说有一个蛊族，特别精于巫术
They say a kind of worm tribe specialize in witchcraft

201
00:17:54,173 --> 00:17:57,108
巫术我就不相信 我只相信有外星人存在
I only believe in science.

202
00:19:20,726 --> 00:19:24,162
对不起，我打破了你的宝物
Sorry for breaking your gem

203
00:19:25,497 --> 00:19:29,126
不要紧，我还有好多，送给你好了
Never mind I still have spare, Keep this.

204
00:19:29,401 --> 00:19:30,732
真的？    真的
Really? Yes

205
00:19:32,504 --> 00:19:33,835
我要走了
I have to go.

206
00:19:46,618 --> 00:19:49,018
你不应该接近那个女孩子的
You should get close to that girl.

207
00:19:49,121 --> 00:19:51,316
蛊族的人残忍冷酷
Their tribe's cruel

208
00:19:51,356 --> 00:19:54,416
而且还有很多不可思议的邪术
and knows witchcraft

209
00:19:57,029 --> 00:20:00,192
教授，跟她聊两句就下降头
Professor, if they cast a spell to anyone who talks to.

210
00:20:00,899 --> 00:20:02,491
那他们那帮人不是很忙？
they must be damn busy

211
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:05,932
总之我是队长
Anyways, I'm the team leader

212
00:20:05,971 --> 00:20:10,032
我对于你们这班人的安全是有责任的
It's my responsibility to protect you guys.

213
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:15,672
这些鼓声？
Sounds of the drum?

214
00:20:21,587 --> 00:20:25,387
这些是蛊族的鼓声来的，是祭神鼓
It comes from the worm tribe and signal offerings

215
00:20:25,657 --> 00:20:27,591
那他们是不是在祭神？
They are offering to god, eh?

216
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:30,558
你们千万不要过看呀
Don't ever go and see it.

217
00:20:30,963 --> 00:20:32,828
我们不会过去看的……
We won't!

218
00:20:55,287 --> 00:20:57,050
好大的场面
What a big procession!

219
00:21:09,334 --> 00:21:10,323
过去
Go over there.

220
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:55,875
是她
It's her

221
00:21:55,947 --> 00:21:57,414
你说是哪个她呀？
Who?

222
00:21:57,749 --> 00:21:59,051
就是我下午看见的那个
The girl I saw this afternoon

223
00:21:59,051 --> 00:22:01,417
是谁呀？到底是谁呀？ 我也不知道
Which one? I don't know either

224
00:22:07,059 --> 00:22:09,254
你决定了没有？
Have you made up your mind?

225
00:22:09,628 --> 00:22:11,027
我不会答应你的
I won't say YES.

226
00:22:12,531 --> 00:22:15,227
你可能会被选中祭神的
Probably you have been chosen for offering

227
00:22:15,467 --> 00:22:19,961
等老祖宗醒过来的时候，你就要死了
When Old Ancestor wakes up, you'll die

228
00:22:20,539 --> 00:22:23,872
你故意调开黑龙再来选我 我不会屈服的
You deliberately sent Black Dragon away and picked me

229
00:22:24,076 --> 00:22:26,010
我爱，就只爱黑龙一个人
I only love him.

230
00:22:26,111 --> 00:22:27,635
我不会答应你的
I won't submit.

231
00:22:32,617 --> 00:22:34,050
我的子民
My guys.

232
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:40,486
一年一度老祖宗醒过来的时候
As a previous years. when Old Ancestor wakes up.

233
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:47,598
神的旨意会选择 哪一个会得到的神的荣誉
someone honored by God will be chosen.

234
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:49,583
大巫师，芭珠是前任族长的女儿
Betsy is the daughter of the ex-chief.

235
00:23:49,828 --> 00:23:51,386
请不要把她祭神
please don't offer her to God

236
00:23:51,563 --> 00:23:52,894
这些是神的旨意
This is the will of God.

237
00:23:53,064 --> 00:23:54,998
但是我们从来没有试过
But we have never tried

238
00:24:28,867 --> 00:24:30,892
还有谁不服的？
Anyone else refusing to do this?

239
00:24:40,946 --> 00:24:42,436
送进古墓
Send them to the grave.

240
00:24:56,027 --> 00:24:57,016
我去救她
I have to rescue her

241
00:24:57,729 --> 00:24:58,797
不是吧？
You kidding?

242
00:24:58,797 --> 00:25:00,958
你发神经呀？很容易没命的？
Are you crazy? You may be killed!

243
00:25:01,099 --> 00:25:03,533
我会随机应变的，你们去拿武器来吧
I'll play to the score. You guys go get the weapon

244
00:25:03,802 --> 00:25:06,100
不要呀……        别去呀
No Don't go

245
00:25:07,405 --> 00:25:08,895
怎么办？     现在怎么办？
What now? What shall we do now?

246
00:27:21,172 --> 00:27:22,434
你快点走吧
Run!

247
00:27:22,707 --> 00:27:25,301
他是我们的老祖宗，他不会死的
He's our Old Ancestor. He won't die.

248
00:27:25,443 --> 00:27:27,775
你快点走吧，你不要管我了
Run! Leave me!

249
00:27:28,513 --> 00:27:29,878
都叫你快点走，不要管我啦
I told you to run Just leave me!

250
00:28:20,965 --> 00:28:24,128
救我呀……
Help me!

251
00:28:33,812 --> 00:28:35,336
快点
Hurry up!

252
00:29:17,288 --> 00:29:19,984
有人破坏祭坛，你们快去看看
Intruders! Go and see!

253
00:29:20,058 --> 00:29:21,423
是
Yes!

254
00:29:27,132 --> 00:29:28,326
又有鼓声
Drum sound?

255
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:31,294
他知道有人破坏祭神，要追杀你们
He's pursuing you for your intrusion

256
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:33,128
走
Run!

257
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:43,404
教授
Professor!

258
00:29:43,448 --> 00:29:45,609
你不听命令，你看现在弄成这个样子
You brought the mess because you didn't listen to me

259
00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:47,115
快回营地收拾东西走
Go back to the camp and pack up at once.

260
00:30:34,332 --> 00:30:37,267
走，快点走
Go, quickly.

261
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:41,138
芭珠，芭珠……
Besty, Besty!

262
00:30:57,856 --> 00:31:00,051
上车
Get in the car!

263
00:31:57,515 --> 00:32:03,750
你们两个破坏祭神，亵渎了老祖宗
You two destroyed the sacrifice and blasphemed Old Ancestor

264
00:32:05,056 --> 00:32:11,017
我今天要代表神，给你们应得的惩罚
I'll punish you behalf of God

265
00:33:01,879 --> 00:33:04,074
教授，你……
Professor, you...

266
00:33:12,824 --> 00:33:15,554
原振侠，救我
Yuan Chan, help me!

267
00:33:43,688 --> 00:33:46,179
这些虫子繁殖得很快
These worms are highly prolific

268
00:33:47,892 --> 00:33:49,427
不过你放心
Don't worry.

269
00:33:49,427 --> 00:33:52,055
我不会用这些来对付你的
I won't use them on you

270
00:36:12,203 --> 00:36:14,171
我对不起你们
I'm sorry for you guys

271
00:36:14,372 --> 00:36:15,737
你快点走
Run, quickly!

272
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:21,143
不要让他们抓住你，你走……
Don't let them get hold of you Run!

273
00:37:19,337 --> 00:37:22,006
这个是我的护身降来的
This is my talismanic worm.

274
00:37:22,006 --> 00:37:24,839
我现在用来救你，但是……
I'm using it to help you, but

275
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:38,411
当我醒过来之后，芭珠已经走了
When I woke up, Betsy was gone.

276
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:41,320
我身上的七个血印也全都没有了
The 7 bloodstains on my body were gone.

277
00:37:41,859 --> 00:37:43,759
所以我一个人走了
So I left alone.

278
00:37:51,302 --> 00:37:54,396
我回到香港已经一年了 什么事也没有
I've been back to HK a year and nothing happened

279
00:37:54,438 --> 00:37:55,928
想不到现在……
But now,,.

280
00:37:56,274 --> 00:37:58,742
黑龙警告过你，为什么你不相信他？
Black Dragon warned you Why don't you trust him?

281
00:37:59,677 --> 00:38:03,204
我都不认识这个人 谁知道他找我想干什么？
I don't even know him How do I know what he wants me?

282
00:38:04,315 --> 00:38:05,680
说得也对
That's right

283
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:09,518
你们还……
You guys

284
00:38:10,688 --> 00:38:12,178
怎么了？振侠
What's wrong, Chan?

285
00:38:12,390 --> 00:38:14,358
阿素，去把药箱拿来
So, go get the first aid kit.

286
00:38:16,193 --> 00:38:18,024
第二个血咒爆开了
The 2nd blood curst has burst

287
00:38:18,496 --> 00:38:19,861
那第一个在什么时候爆的？
When did the first burst occur?

288
00:38:20,364 --> 00:38:22,025
跟现在的时间差不多
More or less the same time.

289
00:38:23,334 --> 00:38:25,962
如果真的这样 那就是二十四小时爆一个
It means one burst every 24 hour.

290
00:38:26,337 --> 00:38:29,170
五天之内就会爆到心脏，你就会死了
When it spreads to the heart. you'll die in 5 days

291
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:35,006
卫先生，你对巫术的认识这么深
Mr. Wai, you know witchcraft well.

292
00:38:35,179 --> 00:38:36,646
我有没有得救？
Is there any chance of survival for me?

293
00:38:38,282 --> 00:38:41,274
血咒是巫术之中最神秘和最复杂的
Blood curse is the most mysterious.

294
00:38:41,619 --> 00:38:42,950
也是最厉害的一种
and complex of its kind in witchcraft.

295
00:38:46,057 --> 00:38:48,048
芭珠虽然用护身降保护过你
Betsy used a spell to save you

296
00:38:48,426 --> 00:38:49,893
但只能保护你一年
But it worked for one year only

297
00:38:52,697 --> 00:38:54,892
所以黑龙叫你去泰国一定有理由
There must be a reason Black Dragon wants you go to go Thailand.

298
00:38:55,933 --> 00:38:57,764
你的意思是叫我去泰国
You want me to go to Thailand?

299
00:38:58,669 --> 00:39:01,832
振侠，解铃还须系铃人
Chan,only the doer can undo a damage done.

300
00:39:03,908 --> 00:39:06,604
好，我明天一早去找黑龙
Ok, I'll go see him tomorrow

301
00:39:06,944 --> 00:39:10,436
这么刺激的事情 你一定要给我独家资料呀
Such an exciting thing. You gotta gimme the scoop on this

302
00:39:10,481 --> 00:39:11,948
又是你？
You again?

303
00:39:12,283 --> 00:39:15,013
表哥，你跟他很熟的吗？
Cousin, you know much about him?

304
00:39:15,152 --> 00:39:16,141
卫先生
Mr. Wai?

305
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:20,516
振侠，彩虹是卫先生的表妹 一向都很任性的
Chan, Rainbow is Wai's spoiled cousin

306
00:39:20,558 --> 00:39:21,923
你不要怪她
Don't be mad

307
00:39:22,126 --> 00:39:23,457
我发觉什么都有你的份
You wanna screw up everything

308
00:39:23,561 --> 00:39:24,994
我跟他很熟的
I know him well

309
00:39:25,529 --> 00:39:28,930
这样好了，我不用你替我拍裸照了
Fine, I don't wanna take your naked photo

310
00:39:29,066 --> 00:39:30,624
你让我跟你去泰国
Lemme go with you to Thailand, OK?

311
00:39:31,168 --> 00:39:32,328
你以为我去玩？
You think I'm going traveling?

312
00:39:32,403 --> 00:39:35,895
彩虹，这件事情非常严重 你不可以去
Rainbow, it's serious, You can't go.

313
00:39:36,006 --> 00:39:37,371
这么说你是看不起我了？
You mean I'm not qualified?

314
00:39:37,541 --> 00:39:40,704
你知不知道 我跟原医生一起出生入死过的
I went through fire and water with Dr Yuan.

315
00:39:40,945 --> 00:39:42,139
原医生你说是不是？
You agree so?

316
00:39:42,246 --> 00:39:43,543
我不会让你跟我一起去的
I won't let you go with me.

317
00:39:46,016 --> 00:39:47,847
振侠，明天我有点事情要办
Chan, I have something to do tomorrow.

318
00:39:47,885 --> 00:39:48,977
后天我赶去帮你
I'll meet you up the day after.

319
00:39:49,253 --> 00:39:50,982
你有什么事打电话给泰国警方
Call the Thai police if anything happens.

320
00:39:51,055 --> 00:39:52,386
我会跟他们联络的
I'll keep in touch with them.

321
00:39:53,357 --> 00:39:54,125
谢谢你
Thank you

322
00:39:54,125 --> 00:39:54,859
别客气
No problem

323
00:39:54,859 --> 00:39:56,918
表哥，你都不帮我的？
Cousin, you don't wanna help me?

324
00:39:57,595 --> 00:39:59,495
记者搜集资料要有个限度
A reporter shouldn't go too far in coverage.

325
00:39:59,630 --> 00:40:01,188
这件事有生命危险的
This is a matter of life and death.

326
00:40:02,433 --> 00:40:05,368
你只是贪玩，我不想你出什么事
You are only in for kicks, Stay out of it.

327
00:40:17,882 --> 00:40:19,281
原振侠先生吗？
Mr. Yuan Chan?

328
00:40:20,084 --> 00:40:21,073
我是
I am.

329
00:40:21,118 --> 00:40:22,551
请你跟我来
Please follow me.

330
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:24,088
你是……？
You are?

331
00:40:24,088 --> 00:40:26,750
我老板叫我来接你的 你去了就明白了
My boss sends me to pick you up You'll know when you see

332
00:40:45,009 --> 00:40:45,976
你老板呢？
Where's your boss?

333
00:40:45,976 --> 00:40:47,534
原先生，请你先坐一会儿
Mr, Yuan, please take a rest

334
00:40:47,578 --> 00:40:48,567
谢谢
Thanks

335
00:41:24,381 --> 00:41:25,370
傻瓜
Idiot

336
00:41:25,850 --> 00:41:26,839
又是你？
You again?

337
00:41:27,451 --> 00:41:28,975
我比你早一班飞机来的
I came on earlier flight

338
00:41:30,721 --> 00:41:31,983
怎么有这么多武器在这儿？
Why there are so many weapons?

339
00:41:32,556 --> 00:41:34,285
我们要进原始森林去冒险呀
We're going to a primitive jungle

340
00:41:34,492 --> 00:41:36,289
不带这些东西怎么够安全呢
It's unsafe without them.

341
00:41:36,927 --> 00:41:39,657
还有这把是最新的镭射导向枪
This is the latest laser-guided gun.

342
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,024
你买得起吗？
Can you afford it?

343
00:41:45,503 --> 00:41:47,130
我爸是董太平呀
My dad is Tung Tai Ping.

344
00:41:48,272 --> 00:41:50,069
香港地产大王董太平？
Property magnate Tung Tai Ping?

345
00:41:50,674 --> 00:41:52,198
我管他什么王
I couldn't care less

346
00:41:52,576 --> 00:41:55,545
总之他有一张没有限额 的金卡给我用就行了
As long as I have a Gold card for an unlimited sum

347
00:41:56,514 --> 00:42:00,507
漂亮，无知，年轻，不知死活
Pretty, nescience, young, hell-bent,,.

348
00:42:00,751 --> 00:42:02,048
再加上有钱
and rich.

349
00:42:02,152 --> 00:42:04,382
我想你是全世界最麻烦的女人了
I think you are the most troublesome woman in the world

350
00:42:05,055 --> 00:42:07,546
我每次找资料都是自己掏腰包的
I always pay for into out of my own pocket

351
00:42:08,292 --> 00:42:09,725
我们现在不是去打仗
We are not going to war

352
00:42:09,994 --> 00:42:13,157
同时巫术也不是这些东西 可以打得死的，小姐
These can't overcome witchcraft.

353
00:42:14,298 --> 00:42:16,027
我们来谈谈生意吧？
Let's talk about business

354
00:42:16,767 --> 00:42:18,928
我已经在老总面前夸下了海口
I've already made a promise to the editor

355
00:42:18,969 --> 00:42:20,561
又跟合众社联络过了
And got in touch with the United Press

356
00:42:20,771 --> 00:42:23,968
如果能拿到你的资料就全世界登头条
If your info can be front-page in world newspaper.

357
00:42:24,041 --> 00:42:25,565
利益你占一半吧？
I'll split half the profit with you

358
00:42:26,277 --> 00:42:27,767
我没空跟你一起疯
I'm in no mood for your frenzied idea

359
00:42:28,312 --> 00:42:30,872
我可不管那么多，总之我一定要去的
I don't care, I wanna go with you.

360
00:42:31,015 --> 00:42:32,243
难道你能绑得住我吗？
Are you going to tie me up?

361
00:42:34,618 --> 00:42:37,246
喂，死傻瓜，你放了……
Hey, idiot, let me go.

362
00:42:39,256 --> 00:42:40,814
不要低估男人呀
Don't ever underrate a man

363
00:43:33,143 --> 00:43:34,610
你终于来了
You finally come

364
00:43:35,946 --> 00:43:36,970
你似乎……？
You seem like

365
00:43:37,481 --> 00:43:39,472
我一回来就被人追杀
I was being pursued immediately returned.

366
00:43:42,252 --> 00:43:43,276
谁追杀你？
Who pursued you?

367
00:43:43,821 --> 00:43:46,153
是大巫师，他知道我找过你
The sorcerer, He knew that I found you.

368
00:43:46,590 --> 00:43:50,117
于是勾结曼谷的黑社会 联手来对付我们
He conspired with the underworld against us.

369
00:43:50,461 --> 00:43:52,088
原来他们是有联络的
They're all of a kind

370
00:43:52,363 --> 00:43:55,594
所以我一回来就被人伏击
I was assaulted when I returned.

371
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:57,697
那我们即刻走
Let's leave right now.

372
00:45:04,068 --> 00:45:05,558
这里就是蛊族？
Is this the worm tribe?

373
00:45:05,636 --> 00:45:09,470
不是，这个是善良的部族 以耕种为生
No, it's a good tribe working of farmers.

374
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:11,906
但是蛊族经常骚扰他们
But they often attacked by the worm tribe.

375
00:45:20,851 --> 00:45:22,785
黑龙，你回来就好了
Dragon, it's good to have you back

376
00:45:22,886 --> 00:45:24,786
族长，发生了什么事情？
Chief, what happened?

377
00:45:24,988 --> 00:45:26,751
我们这儿发生了一件怪事
A weird thing happened.

378
00:45:27,191 --> 00:45:31,093
今天下午村子里所有的小孩子 突然全都不见了
All kids in the village disappeared this afternoon.

379
00:45:31,228 --> 00:45:33,025
突然不见了？      是呀
All disappear? Yep

380
00:45:35,365 --> 00:45:36,354
什么事？
What happened?

381
00:45:36,467 --> 00:45:38,298
我们村里的孩子突然神秘失踪了
All kids in our village are disappeared.

382
00:45:38,368 --> 00:45:40,336
一定是被大巫师抓去炼鬼仔降
It must be the sorcerer have abducted them for casting Little Ghost Spell

383
00:45:40,437 --> 00:45:41,472
鬼仔降？
Little Ghost Spell?

384
00:45:41,472 --> 00:45:44,407
鬼仔降要用一百个孩子的血 才能够炼成
Yes, it's made of 1 00 children's blood

385
00:45:44,541 --> 00:45:47,009
他们会飞行、吸血，挡者必死
They can fly, suck blood and kill people

386
00:45:47,177 --> 00:45:49,213
可是三年之后就不能再用了
The spell has to be remade

387
00:45:49,213 --> 00:45:50,680
一定要重新再炼
after three years.

388
00:45:51,248 --> 00:45:52,579
他真是太残忍了
How cruel he is!

389
00:45:52,983 --> 00:45:56,180
是呀，我在祭神的那天晚上 也见过那个小鬼
Right, I saw the little ghost on the offering night.

390
00:45:56,754 --> 00:46:00,053
族长希望我带全村的勇士 把孩子们救回来
The chief wants me to bring men to rescue the kids

391
00:46:00,924 --> 00:46:01,825
好
OK.

392
00:46:01,825 --> 00:46:02,985
我也要去呀
I wanna go, too.

393
00:46:21,011 --> 00:46:22,239
今晚好安静呀！      是呀
It's so quiet tonight. Yep

394
00:46:22,446 --> 00:46:24,880
静得连虫声也没有，一定有问题
Not even chirps There must be something wrong.

395
00:46:25,082 --> 00:46:26,106
小心点
Be careful!

396
00:46:49,473 --> 00:46:50,497
快点走呀
Run quickly!

397
00:46:50,641 --> 00:46:53,109
你们不要走，别乱跑，回来
Don't run Come back!

398
00:47:08,559 --> 00:47:09,856
好痛呀
It hurts!

399
00:47:12,262 --> 00:47:14,753
我早叫你别跟着来 你知不知道这里多危险？
I told you not to follow. Don't you know how dangerous is it?

400
00:47:15,199 --> 00:47:17,463
不跟着来也已经跟了
I've already followed you all the way

401
00:47:17,534 --> 00:47:19,900
不跟下去那个不就是白痴
There's no way not to continue.

402
00:47:22,906 --> 00:47:25,773
你知不知道？这里埋了很多机关的
Don't you know that there are many booby-traps here?

403
00:47:26,443 --> 00:47:29,276
你放心好了，我在美国念书的时候
Don't worry, I have read quite many books of Vietcong tactics

404
00:47:29,413 --> 00:47:31,938
看过很多有关越战杀人机关的书
when I studied in US

405
00:47:45,362 --> 00:47:49,025
这样就可以证明 我可以自己照顾自己了吧
That shows I can take care of myself.

406
00:47:49,733 --> 00:47:52,463
不要说了，我们要争取时间，走吧
Fine, we have to work against time now, Let's go.

407
00:48:00,644 --> 00:48:02,805
我上去看看，你们别吵呀
I'll go up and have a look, Keep quiet

408
00:48:05,616 --> 00:48:06,605
彩虹
Rainbow!

409
00:48:07,050 --> 00:48:07,918
你去哪儿？
Where are you going?

410
00:48:07,918 --> 00:48:08,819
去照相呀
To take pictures

411
00:48:08,819 --> 00:48:11,913
彩虹，你跟着我 我就要向卫先生负责你的安全
Rainbow, I have to be responsible for your safety if you're with me

412
00:48:12,256 --> 00:48:14,156
这儿太危险，我不可以让你乱来的
It's too dangerous I can't let you go

413
00:48:14,258 --> 00:48:16,283
用不着你负责，大男人
I don't care, What a male chauvinist!

414
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:18,055
彩虹，你听我说好不好？
Rainbow, listen.

415
00:48:18,128 --> 00:48:19,891
这儿的事我经历过，实在太危险了
I've been through this It's too dangerous

416
00:48:19,963 --> 00:48:21,794
有些事你想也想不到的
Things are beyond your control.

417
00:48:22,566 --> 00:48:23,931
放手呀
Let go!

418
00:48:24,334 --> 00:48:26,393
我警告你，你要再碰我一下
I'm telling you, if you touch me again.

419
00:48:26,436 --> 00:48:28,461
我就告诉我表哥，说你非礼我
I'll tell my cousin you hares me

420
00:48:30,874 --> 00:48:32,910
不过以你的声誉来说
Though with your reputation.

421
00:48:32,910 --> 00:48:35,936
起码十个人之中也有 两个人是不相信的
few people will believe that.

422
00:48:36,313 --> 00:48:38,304
我不管你说什么？总之你要听我的
I don't care what you say You have to listen to me

423
00:48:38,415 --> 00:48:40,815
不然我就脱掉你的裤子 打你屁股，然后拍照
Or I'll spank you without pants

424
00:48:41,084 --> 00:48:42,108
你敢？
How dare you?

425
00:48:44,187 --> 00:48:45,381
你好卑鄙
You nasty!

426
00:48:45,722 --> 00:48:46,916
卑鄙又怎么样？
So what?

427
00:48:47,124 --> 00:48:50,582
我懒得理你，我走了 我再也不回来了
I won't care about you I'm leaving now, I won't come back.

428
00:48:50,661 --> 00:48:51,992
好，随便你
Up to you

429
00:48:52,262 --> 00:48:55,459
就算我回头的时候 被毒蛇咬了，被毒箭射了
I won't return even if I were bitten by snakes.

430
00:48:55,599 --> 00:48:57,829
被毒男人吓着了，我也不回来了
hit by arrows or scared by men!

431
00:48:57,901 --> 00:49:01,598
我懒得理你了，我看你后不后悔？
I won't care for you anymore Don't regret.

432
00:49:05,208 --> 00:49:06,539
你好狠心
You're so cruel hearted

433
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:11,006
拜拜了
Bye-bye

434
00:49:18,455 --> 00:49:20,116
怎么走得这么快？
She's away in a twinkle

435
00:49:22,125 --> 00:49:25,356
那些小孩子都关在笼子里 有很多人看守
The kids are all caged and guarded.

436
00:49:25,595 --> 00:49:27,153
我看不如先救芭珠吧？
We'd better go and help Betsy first.

437
00:49:27,230 --> 00:49:28,254
好
OK.

438
00:49:29,199 --> 00:49:30,826
彩虹姑娘呢？
Where's Miss Rainbow?

439
00:49:31,335 --> 00:49:34,327
她又发小姐脾气，已经回去了
She got pissed off and she left

440
00:49:34,404 --> 00:49:37,396
别管她，对了，芭珠姑娘呢？
Never mind her Where's Betsy?

441
00:49:43,814 --> 00:49:44,906
芭珠
Betsy?

442
00:49:45,782 --> 00:49:46,806
黑龙
Dragon.

443
00:49:48,585 --> 00:49:50,143
我把原医生带来了
I've brought back Dr Yuan.

444
00:49:51,254 --> 00:49:53,023
我来了，芭珠
I'm here, Betsy

445
00:49:53,023 --> 00:49:53,957
你们不要过来
Don't come over

446
00:49:53,957 --> 00:49:56,084
我不想任何人看见我现在的样子
I don't want anyone to see me now.

447
00:49:57,794 --> 00:50:00,957
算了，我看过她的样子 被她吓了一跳
Forget it, Her looks scared me

448
00:50:05,402 --> 00:50:08,963
芭珠，我身上的第四颗血咒 已经爆开了
Betsy, the 4th blood curse on me has burst.

449
00:50:09,473 --> 00:50:12,340
现在要想办法救你和我
We have to figure out how to save you and me

450
00:50:13,643 --> 00:50:16,305
我爸爸临死之前曾经告诉我
My dad told me before he died.

451
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:20,883
有种神奇的圣物叫舍利子 可以解一切的降头
Some holy ashes can break any kinds of spell

452
00:50:21,718 --> 00:50:26,121
一年前，我中了鬼面降之后 就翻查过祖宗的典籍
I consulted the records of the tribe.

453
00:50:26,590 --> 00:50:28,615
终于知道舍利子收藏的地方
And have found the hiding place.

454
00:50:28,959 --> 00:50:29,893
在哪里？
Where?

455
00:50:29,893 --> 00:50:32,384
藏在山洞的大佛，无路可上
A large Buddha in a cave It's out of reach.

456
00:50:32,496 --> 00:50:34,259
根本就没有人爬上去过
No one can climp up.

457
00:50:35,332 --> 00:50:36,765
所以就拿不到舍利子
So they are unobtainable

458
00:50:36,967 --> 00:50:39,731
我相信你是上天派来给我的救星
I believe that you're my saviour from Heaven.

459
00:50:39,870 --> 00:50:42,168
所以我叫黑龙来找你
So I sent Dragon to get you

460
00:50:45,642 --> 00:50:46,939
可以试试
We can have a try

461
00:50:47,310 --> 00:50:50,279
你还有三天的寿命 你不想试也要试了
You only have 3 days to live. No other choice

462
00:50:52,115 --> 00:50:53,343
我回去给他们打电报
I'll go telegram them.

463
00:50:53,417 --> 00:50:54,441
叫人带齐装备来
Askk them to prepare everything.

464
00:50:54,484 --> 00:50:56,952
还有，原医生，舍利子拿了出来之后
Besides, the Ashes will wither in 6 hours

465
00:50:57,120 --> 00:50:58,451
六小时就会枯了
after you take out.

466
00:51:00,290 --> 00:51:04,784
救命呀，你们干什么？快点放我下来
Help! What are you doing? Put me down!

467
00:51:05,295 --> 00:51:07,889
最多我给钱你们，快放了我
I'll give you money, Release me!

468
00:51:11,468 --> 00:51:12,867
快放了我
Release me!

469
00:51:15,138 --> 00:51:16,503
放开她
Release her.

470
00:51:20,110 --> 00:51:22,977
你一定是这里的大老板 你真是个大好人
You must be the boss here. You're such a nice guy.

471
00:51:23,146 --> 00:51:24,738
我先走了，拜拜
I gotta go, bye

472
00:51:29,619 --> 00:51:34,249
其实我只是走错了路 不小心掉在陷阱里了嘛
I've got the wrong way and been trapped

473
00:51:34,991 --> 00:51:37,482
是不是黑龙带你来的？
Did you send by Black Dragon?

474
00:51:38,695 --> 00:51:43,564
不是呀，我是来采集标本的
No, I'm here to collect specimens

475
00:51:44,768 --> 00:51:47,737
你这么英明神武，我替你拍张照
You look handsome. Lemem take a photo for you

476
00:51:48,371 --> 00:51:49,531
去死吧
Damn you!

477
00:51:59,850 --> 00:52:01,977
行了，我知道了，就这样吧，OVER
OK, I know Fine Over!

478
00:52:10,293 --> 00:52:11,726
装备和救星就快到了
Backup and equipment are coming soon

479
00:52:11,928 --> 00:52:13,088
彩虹还没有回来？
Rainbow's not back yet.

480
00:52:13,330 --> 00:52:15,059
奇怪，这么久还不见她回来？
What takes her so long?

481
00:52:15,332 --> 00:52:16,594
究竟到哪儿去了？
Where 's she been to?

482
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:20,236
有两个可能，一个是死了 一个就是让他们抓去了
There're 2 possibilities, one is dead. and one is been caught

483
00:52:23,006 --> 00:52:25,338
如果被人抓去了，会关在哪儿呢？
If she's been caught, where could she be?

484
00:52:25,408 --> 00:52:28,741
她是外人，一定会送到大巫师那儿
She's an outsider. must be taken to the sorcerer.

485
00:52:34,384 --> 00:52:35,874
那我们先去救芭珠
Let's save Betsy first.

486
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:38,187
先去救彩虹
Rescue Rainbow.

487
00:52:39,723 --> 00:52:40,781
好朋友
Good buddy!

488
00:55:26,790 --> 00:55:27,814
彩虹姑娘
Miss Rainbow.

489
00:55:52,415 --> 00:55:54,542
彩虹她没什么事吧？
How is her?

490
00:55:55,085 --> 00:55:58,452
她的体温很奇怪 可是又没有发烧和发冷的迹象
Her temperature is weird But she's not having a fever or cold

491
00:56:00,223 --> 00:56:02,191
我出去看看救兵到了没有？
Lemme go and see if the backup's arrived

492
00:56:14,771 --> 00:56:15,760
彩虹
Rainbow!

493
00:56:43,299 --> 00:56:44,134
什么事？
What happened?

494
00:56:44,134 --> 00:56:45,897
她失去了常性，还力大无穷
She goes berserk and is herculean

495
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:06,546
彩虹……你怎么啦？
Rainbow, what are you doing?

496
00:57:16,766 --> 00:57:17,755
抓住她
Catch her!

497
00:57:35,318 --> 00:57:36,546
怎么会搞成这样呢？
What happened?

498
00:57:37,954 --> 00:57:39,353
她被大巫师抓去了
She's caught by the Sorcerer.

499
00:57:39,522 --> 00:57:41,490
我们救她回来的时候已经是这样了
Then she's like this after we found her.

500
00:57:42,091 --> 00:57:46,494
依我看，她是中了黑心降 所以力大无穷
I think she must have got the Black Spell.

501
00:57:46,763 --> 00:57:47,889
见人就杀
So she's herculean and wants to kill

502
00:57:48,064 --> 00:57:51,227
那么我们怎么替她解降呢？
How can we break the spell?

503
00:57:51,868 --> 00:57:53,392
让我来
Lemme help you.

504
00:57:54,938 --> 00:57:56,371
芭珠？
Betsy?

505
00:58:01,377 --> 00:58:03,436
要解黑心降就要以黑制黑
Black is needed to break a black spell.

506
00:58:03,947 --> 00:58:07,280
用七种黑色动物的血 包括黑羊，黑牛
Mix the blood of Black sheep, oxen.

507
00:58:07,383 --> 00:58:11,479
黑狗，黑猫，黑蛇，黑鹰和黑蜥蜴
dogs, cats, snakes, eagles and lizards.

508
00:58:11,955 --> 00:58:15,618
将七种血混和煮热，让她浸泡
Boil it and bathe her with it.

509
00:58:15,892 --> 00:58:17,484
泡到她醒过来为止
Immerse her until she wakes up

510
00:58:57,800 --> 00:58:59,267
鬼呀
Ghost!

511
00:59:05,141 --> 00:59:06,335
怎么了？       什么事？
What happened? What's up?

512
00:59:07,911 --> 00:59:09,276
她看见我的脸
She saw my face

513
00:59:09,913 --> 00:59:11,005
没事，没事
It's OK.

514
00:59:11,748 --> 00:59:13,875
她是被大巫师害成这个样子的
The sorcerer persecuted her like this

515
00:59:14,150 --> 00:59:16,414
全靠她救回你的命
She saved you.

516
00:59:17,186 --> 00:59:18,448
她已经没事了
She's fine now

517
00:59:19,088 --> 00:59:22,524
原医生，时间不多了 你快点去拿舍利子吧
Dr, Yuan, there's not much time. Go find the Ashes?

518
00:59:27,163 --> 00:59:28,187
黑龙
Black Dragon

519
00:59:29,232 --> 00:59:32,030
无论你拿不拿到舍利子 你一定要回来
No matter if you can find it. you have to come back

520
00:59:34,070 --> 00:59:35,731
我要跟你一起去
I wanna go with you

521
00:59:36,005 --> 00:59:37,404
彩虹，不要任性
Rainbow, be good

522
00:59:38,474 --> 00:59:40,101
那……你一定要回来呀
Then,,,you have to come back!

523
00:59:49,953 --> 00:59:50,942
什么事？
What happened?

524
00:59:51,588 --> 00:59:55,354
卫先生，我肋骨上第六个血咒爆开了
Mr. Wai, the 6th curse has burst.

525
00:59:55,925 --> 00:59:57,324
但是流血不多
Not much bleeding.

526
00:59:58,895 --> 01:00:00,726
可是当第七个血咒爆的时候
But when the 7th bursts.

527
01:00:01,197 --> 01:00:03,927
你全身的血就会从血洞流出来
all your blood will spill out.

528
01:00:06,936 --> 01:00:10,736
卫先生，明天就是我在世上最后一天
Mr, Wai, tomorrow is the last day of my life

529
01:00:12,208 --> 01:00:16,167
振侠，我不相信命运 可以控制一个勇敢的人
Yuan Chan, I don't believe in fate can contral a brave man.

530
01:00:16,379 --> 01:00:18,142
我相信人定胜天
I think man conquers fate.

531
01:00:18,414 --> 01:00:19,506
黑龙
Black Dragon.

532
01:00:19,782 --> 01:00:21,147
大巫师叫什么名字？
what's the name of that sorcerer?

533
01:00:21,317 --> 01:00:22,750
阿古拉大巫师
Sorcerer Aquala

534
01:00:23,720 --> 01:00:25,085
阿古拉？
Aquala?

535
01:00:25,822 --> 01:00:30,418
阿古拉家族的巫术是 中南半岛之中最神秘和最残忍的
The witchcraft of this clan is the most mysterious and cruel in the South.

536
01:00:30,860 --> 01:00:32,054
他有没有炼鬼仔降
Did he practice Little Ghost Spell?

537
01:00:32,261 --> 01:00:33,250
有
Yes

538
01:00:33,763 --> 01:00:35,492
你们马上找只母牛，要大肚子的
Get a pregnant cow at once

539
01:00:35,698 --> 01:00:37,689
宰了之后把胎盘留下，还有……
Slaughter it and get her placenta out.

540
01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:39,529
杀一条黑狗，把血留下，去吧
A black dog as well and get its blood.

541
01:00:39,669 --> 01:00:40,693
是
Yes!

542
01:00:41,237 --> 01:00:43,068
卫斯理，用来干什么？
Wesley, what is it for?

543
01:00:43,706 --> 01:00:46,231
以前我跟阿古拉家族中 其中一个儿子做过朋友
To break the Little Ghost Spell.

544
01:00:46,609 --> 01:00:48,736
他教过我怎么破“鬼仔降”的方法
a friend of Aquala Clan taught me that

545
01:00:49,145 --> 01:00:50,703
我不知道有没有效
I don't know if it works

546
01:00:52,115 --> 01:00:54,447
振侠，这一次要靠你自己了
Chan, it's all up to yourself.

547
01:00:55,685 --> 01:00:59,587
老祖宗……赐给我力量
Old Ancestor, gimme power!

548
01:00:59,889 --> 01:01:04,121
用血的力量，集中变成血鬼
Use the blood power to turn into blood ghosts

549
01:01:08,264 --> 01:01:11,495
快去给我把原振侠他们杀了
Go kill the guys of Yuan Chan!

550
01:02:02,719 --> 01:02:03,845
那两颗舍利子呢？
Where are those two grains of ashes?

551
01:02:04,787 --> 01:02:06,277
在它那对眼睛里
Inside the eyes

552
01:02:11,327 --> 01:02:13,989
我们要慢慢地爬上去，你没问题吧？
We gotta climb up. do you have problem with it?

553
01:02:14,397 --> 01:02:16,331
喜玛拉雅山我都爬过了
Ha, I have even climbed the Himalaya.

554
01:02:27,110 --> 01:02:30,477
传说上去拿舍利子的人 没有一个可以走出去的
They say no one trying it has ever come out.

555
01:02:31,114 --> 01:02:32,240
要看我们的了
It all depends on us

556
01:02:51,667 --> 01:02:52,759
当心
Watch out!

557
01:02:54,871 --> 01:02:55,895
小心

558
01:04:56,192 --> 01:04:57,921
原振侠……
Yuan Chan!

559
01:05:17,480 --> 01:05:18,640
各位大师
Masters.

560
01:05:20,750 --> 01:05:23,514
我们拿舍利子是用来降魔救人
we try to get them to help someone only.

561
01:05:23,719 --> 01:05:26,051
请各位大师成全我们
Please do us a favor, masters.

562
01:07:07,623 --> 01:07:08,612
快走
Run, quick!

563
01:07:29,178 --> 01:07:30,372
闪开

564
01:07:43,192 --> 01:07:49,028
原振侠……
Yuan Chan!

565
01:08:20,796 --> 01:08:23,264
快吞下舍利子，先解除你的血降
Swallow it now to break the blood spell.

566
01:08:34,410 --> 01:08:35,604
快吞了它

567
01:08:43,552 --> 01:08:45,144
我们要在两小时内赶回去
We have to go back in 2 hours.

568
01:08:45,554 --> 01:08:47,647
要不然另外一颗舍利子就没用了
Or the other grain will become ineffective

569
01:09:20,923 --> 01:09:24,256
彩虹跟芭珠被人抓去了 你们快救她们，快点去
Rainbow Betsy have been taken by them. Go rescue them quickly!

570
01:09:24,760 --> 01:09:27,729

老祖宗今天一定很高兴

有三男三女送来给他吃

573
01:09:49,018 --> 01:09:50,508
上天会惩罚你的

574
01:09:51,320 --> 01:09:53,151
原振侠就快来杀你了

575
01:09:56,125 --> 01:09:58,650
我现在就是想等他们来

576
01:09:59,461 --> 01:10:00,792
我们已经来了

我都说过他会来的

578
01:10:09,505 --> 01:10:13,271
老祖宗

01:10:16,111 --> 01:10:20,480
阿古拉，你作恶多端，多行不义

580
01:10:20,783 --> 01:10:23,149
今天要你作法自毙

581
01:10:32,561 --> 01:10:33,687
老祖宗

582
01:10:40,469 --> 01:10:41,458
快走

583
01:10:51,614 --> 01:10:52,638
小心

584
01:11:55,611 --> 01:11:56,600
彩虹
Rainbow!

585
01:12:35,451 --> 01:12:36,543
黑龙
Black Dragon!

586
01:12:43,359 --> 01:12:44,621
走开呀
Stay aside!

587
01:13:25,667 --> 01:13:27,066
放鬼仔
Let loose the Little Ghost!

588
01:15:42,971 --> 01:15:44,268
那颗舍利子呢？
Where's the grain?

589
01:15:44,873 --> 01:15:45,965
在这儿
It's here.

590
01:15:49,144 --> 01:15:51,442
糟了，已经过时了
Damn, it's over the time.

591
01:15:53,916 --> 01:15:56,544
那芭珠不是不能恢复原来的样子了
Betsy can't restore her original looks then

592
01:16:05,861 --> 01:16:08,230
黑龙，如果我一辈子都是这个样子
Dragon, would you love me still

593
01:16:08,230 --> 01:16:09,288
还爱不爱我？
if I look like this all my life?

594
01:16:13,135 --> 01:16:17,799
大巫师已经死了 我们的族人从此得到新生
The sorcerer is dead Our tribes can lead a new life from now on.

595
01:16:18,173 --> 01:16:22,166
我可以帮他们生活得好一点
I can help them live better.

596
01:16:24,112 --> 01:16:25,545
那……那不是很可惜？
Isn't that a pity?

597
01:16:25,614 --> 01:16:28,242
一个人真正的美不是在她的脸上
Beauty lies on one's heart.

598
01:16:28,350 --> 01:16:29,544
而是在她心里面
not on one's face
