1
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:48,774
''I've already mastered
the 4th Buddha's Palm stance.

2
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:54,220
I miss Sister and Brother Kim Fei

3
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:56,450
Take me to them!

4
00:00:56,656 --> 00:00:58,248
Silly girl!

5
00:00:58,758 --> 00:01:01,294
You'll run into your father

6
00:01:01,294 --> 00:01:04,127
If you go look for them.''

7
00:01:04,597 --> 00:01:06,565
I'm going, kiddo.

8
00:01:06,866 --> 00:01:08,834
-Take care, Master.
-Thanks.

9
00:01:10,703 --> 00:01:12,605
Still watching TV, you silly girl?

10
00:01:12,605 --> 00:01:15,005
Your master's leaving!

11
00:01:24,117 --> 00:01:27,420
Master. Is ''Buddha's Palm'' real?

12
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:30,824
It's just a movie, silly girl.

13
00:01:30,824 --> 00:01:32,883
How can it be real?

14
00:01:33,593 --> 00:01:35,220
Master...

15
00:01:36,229 --> 00:01:38,865
When will you take me
off this mountain?

16
00:01:38,865 --> 00:01:40,834
When you're all grown up!

17
00:01:40,834 --> 00:01:43,268
I'll have taken you off
this mountain by then.

18
00:01:48,208 --> 00:01:51,575
''999--WHO'S THE MURDERER?''

19
00:01:55,415 --> 00:01:59,044
Come on in! Place your bets!

20
00:02:09,195 --> 00:02:12,062
Uncle Fat! Good luck!

21
00:02:15,935 --> 00:02:17,770
-Cho Tat-wah!
-Dad!

22
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:20,933
Well? Lost again?

23
00:02:21,207 --> 00:02:23,977
You already owe us
a fortune.

24
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:26,275
This is not good.

25
00:02:26,746 --> 00:02:30,316
I don't care. You have to
pay us back no matter what.

26
00:02:30,316 --> 00:02:32,011
Otherwise...

27
00:02:32,485 --> 00:02:34,821
You'll die for sure, asshole!

28
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:36,856
Dad, the movie is starting!

29
00:02:36,856 --> 00:02:38,653
Hurry! Hurry!

30
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:42,325
Your wife can be a hooker
and you still can't pay!

31
00:03:01,781 --> 00:03:03,183
Brother!

32
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:04,817
Don't worry, Yin.

33
00:03:04,817 --> 00:03:08,275
Freeze! There are guns
aimed at you everywhere.

34
00:03:08,955 --> 00:03:12,559
They're holding Ka Leung hostage
and they want me to open the safe.

35
00:03:12,559 --> 00:03:14,891
Let's go and rescue him,
brother!

36
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:18,464
It's just a life for a life.

37
00:03:18,464 --> 00:03:19,832
Is there enough time?

38
00:03:19,832 --> 00:03:22,460
It's already 10:50.

39
00:03:22,936 --> 00:03:25,572
Last night, there was someone here,
wearing a white trenchcoat.

40
00:03:25,572 --> 00:03:27,506
He went in, and then he left.

41
00:03:27,607 --> 00:03:30,838
But no one came and went
all day today.

42
00:03:31,978 --> 00:03:33,639
That's odd.

43
00:03:42,956 --> 00:03:47,017
Someone shot himself
in the toilet!!

44
00:03:50,697 --> 00:03:52,062
Dad!

45
00:03:53,132 --> 00:03:54,531
Dad!

46
00:03:55,368 --> 00:03:57,393
Dad!!

47
00:04:41,047 --> 00:04:42,571
Dad...

48
00:04:44,217 --> 00:04:46,685
Dad...

49
00:04:54,694 --> 00:04:56,093
Dad!

50
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:07,767
Dad, is that you?

51
00:05:08,041 --> 00:05:10,942
You came back as a frog so soon?

52
00:05:11,511 --> 00:05:13,706
I'll take you home.

53
00:05:21,954 --> 00:05:24,286
Mom! Mom!!

54
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:35,401
Mom, Dad was killed by ''Crazy'',
the guy who runs the gambling place.

55
00:05:35,401 --> 00:05:38,504
I heard him telling Dad
the other day,

56
00:05:38,504 --> 00:05:41,708
''I don't care. You have to
pay us back no matter what.''

57
00:05:41,708 --> 00:05:44,143
And he Also said,

58
00:05:44,143 --> 00:05:47,635
''You'll die for sure''!

59
00:05:51,918 --> 00:05:53,977
It's true!

60
00:05:54,754 --> 00:05:58,024
Dad was a cop.
He wouldn't kill himself!

61
00:05:58,024 --> 00:06:00,117
He wouldn't!!

62
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:13,733
Mom! Mom!!

63
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:17,076
Actually, Dad didn't die.

64
00:06:17,076 --> 00:06:19,601
He only turned into a frog.

65
00:06:21,147 --> 00:06:25,049
See? it's really him!

66
00:06:28,287 --> 00:06:32,246
Be good and listen
to Grandma, understand?

67
00:07:09,295 --> 00:07:12,093
Such a big frog
hopping around!

68
00:07:20,039 --> 00:07:22,701
And I just bought this
new pair of shoes today!

69
00:08:01,614 --> 00:08:03,980
What's wrong, Boss?

70
00:08:04,183 --> 00:08:06,378
Somebody hit me! Dammit!

71
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:09,815
Am I bleeding? Am I bleeding??

72
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:12,553
Goddamn it!

73
00:08:12,925 --> 00:08:16,383
Don't let me catch you or
I'll cut your balls off!

74
00:08:17,029 --> 00:08:21,796
But no one came and went
all day today.

75
00:08:23,369 --> 00:08:25,269
That's odd.

76
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:31,277
You think of a way to look inside

77
00:08:31,277 --> 00:08:33,177
and see what's going on.

78
00:08:36,782 --> 00:08:37,908
Brother!

79
00:08:39,252 --> 00:08:40,987
Don't worry, Yin.

80
00:08:40,987 --> 00:08:44,354
Freeze! There are guns aimed
at you everywhere!

81
00:08:45,258 --> 00:08:49,126
They're holding Ka Leung hostage
and they want me to open the safe.

82
00:08:58,004 --> 00:09:00,438
Why did you kill my master??

83
00:09:00,673 --> 00:09:07,010
Why did you kill my master??

84
00:09:11,017 --> 00:09:14,646
Why did you kill my master??

85
00:09:39,345 --> 00:09:41,336
Sweet Sugar Cane!

86
00:09:42,014 --> 00:09:44,116
Come and get it! Crisp and sweet!

87
00:09:44,116 --> 00:09:47,313
Come and get it! Big and tasty!

88
00:09:48,788 --> 00:09:51,655
Cut it out, you brat!
You're wasting it!

89
00:09:57,563 --> 00:10:00,464
They're plump, but cute!

90
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:03,261
Nice fishballs!

91
00:10:04,103 --> 00:10:06,594
You know what to do, madam!

92
00:10:08,341 --> 00:10:10,142
Good business, granny!

93
00:10:10,142 --> 00:10:11,410
Let me get a cane!

94
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:13,878
Hands off! I get first pick!

95
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,949
-Here you are.
-Thank you.

96
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:18,551
-The canes look good!
-Help yourself.

97
00:10:18,551 --> 00:10:19,950
Each of you, take one.

98
00:10:20,152 --> 00:10:22,279
What? You don't know me?

99
00:10:22,888 --> 00:10:25,448
Quit staring, sugar cane kid!

100
00:10:25,524 --> 00:10:28,828
Your dad still owes me money,
you know!

101
00:10:28,828 --> 00:10:30,997
Keep staring and I'll
break you in half,

102
00:10:30,997 --> 00:10:32,897
just like a sugar cane.

103
00:10:33,099 --> 00:10:35,363
You should take him
to see a doctor!

104
00:10:36,202 --> 00:10:38,033
Bye now. Have some more.

105
00:11:10,636 --> 00:11:13,833
-Where are you going now?
-Hey! Come back and help me!

106
00:11:16,742 --> 00:11:19,178
''We are the Jin Wu School!

107
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:21,447
We are the best!

108
00:11:21,447 --> 00:11:25,076
We will fight ourselves
to fame and glory!

109
00:11:25,618 --> 00:11:29,588
We fight for compassion
and honor!

110
00:11:29,588 --> 00:11:34,616
But our master was murdered.
We must have revenge!''

111
00:11:45,738 --> 00:11:47,603
Fantastic!

112
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:50,199
It's really big!

113
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:52,272
Bigger than your mom's!

114
00:11:52,478 --> 00:11:54,313
If we could just see the girl

115
00:11:54,313 --> 00:11:58,184
and see her taking it in
with her own fair hands,

116
00:11:58,184 --> 00:12:00,086
that would be great!

117
00:12:00,086 --> 00:12:02,281
Let's wait a while then.

118
00:12:12,965 --> 00:12:16,902
Let's go! She could be an old hag!

119
00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:20,463
Let's go!

120
00:12:33,185 --> 00:12:35,287
I say we stone it to death!

121
00:12:35,287 --> 00:12:38,120
I say we bury it alive.
That's more fun!

122
00:12:38,324 --> 00:12:39,391
No, let's do this.

123
00:12:39,391 --> 00:12:41,359
Let's drown it and see
how long it can last.

124
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:43,323
How about...

125
00:12:45,097 --> 00:12:47,233
Death by electrocution?

126
00:12:47,233 --> 00:12:49,258
You're weird!

127
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:54,933
How come there's nothing?

128
00:12:55,074 --> 00:12:56,336
Why's that?

129
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:58,677
You need water!

130
00:12:58,677 --> 00:13:00,201
Let's get some then!

131
00:13:00,546 --> 00:13:03,115
We can just pee on it!

132
00:13:03,115 --> 00:13:04,810
Come on!

133
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:16,193
I'm in deep shit!

134
00:13:17,163 --> 00:13:19,188
I can't feel my little brother!

135
00:13:19,498 --> 00:13:20,795
What?

136
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:22,802
You little brother is right there!

137
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:25,600
No that one! THIs one!

138
00:13:25,838 --> 00:13:27,032
You're kidding!

139
00:13:30,042 --> 00:13:33,279
How dare you play
on our turf, kid?

140
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:36,048
Don't you know who we are?
Which gang do you belong to?

141
00:13:36,048 --> 00:13:37,283
Well?

142
00:13:37,283 --> 00:13:39,418
Then we have to give
all of you a beating!

143
00:13:39,418 --> 00:13:42,080
What do you say? Who says
this is your turf?

144
00:13:42,188 --> 00:13:45,357
I'll take you! One on one!

145
00:13:45,357 --> 00:13:47,159
Motherfucker!
See how cocky he is?

146
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:49,461
Let's cut the bullshit
and kill him first!

147
00:13:49,461 --> 00:13:50,763
Why are you in
such a fucking rush?

148
00:13:50,763 --> 00:13:52,932
Let me find out who he is first,
then I'll kick his ass!

149
00:13:52,932 --> 00:13:54,800
Kid, you better not fuck with me.

150
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:58,201
Tell me which gang you belong to
or I'll fuck you up!

151
00:13:58,337 --> 00:14:00,739
So you want to fight me, huh?
Get me my knife!

152
00:14:00,739 --> 00:14:01,540
Yes, Boss!

153
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:03,007
Here, Boss!

154
00:14:03,576 --> 00:14:05,441
It's a fake! Get them!

155
00:14:06,745 --> 00:14:09,481
''Everybody worships him!
He's most powerful!

156
00:14:09,481 --> 00:14:15,909
He beats up the bad guys
until they plea for mercy!

157
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:20,955
Ma Wing Ching and Chen Jun
are our heroes!

158
00:14:21,227 --> 00:14:26,398
Chen Jun can fight with his
mysterious ''Mi Chung Fist''!

159
00:14:26,398 --> 00:14:30,960
It's Ma Wing Ching against
the Jin Wu School!''

160
00:14:33,239 --> 00:14:35,264
''THE BOXER FROM SHANTUNG''

161
00:14:46,752 --> 00:14:47,776
Showtime!

162
00:14:53,859 --> 00:14:55,417
Watch the stall.
I have to go get some more cane.

163
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:58,560
Hey. Have you seen it yet?

164
00:14:58,764 --> 00:15:02,234
Of course not!
Grandma wouldn't let me go out!

165
00:15:02,234 --> 00:15:04,036
You're missing out!

166
00:15:04,036 --> 00:15:06,472
Don't you know?
Mario Milano is in it!

167
00:15:06,472 --> 00:15:08,173
He has a fight with Ma Wing Jing.

168
00:15:08,173 --> 00:15:09,742
It's awesome!

169
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:11,076
Really?

170
00:15:11,076 --> 00:15:13,812
Milano uses his Cobra Lock on Ma!

171
00:15:13,812 --> 00:15:16,548
Ma turns around and uses
his ''Tiger's Tail Kick''!

172
00:15:16,548 --> 00:15:17,950
So who wins?

173
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:19,975
Ma Wing Jing, of course!

174
00:15:23,889 --> 00:15:25,224
Watch the stall, mom!

175
00:15:25,224 --> 00:15:27,488
You brat! Come back here, now!

176
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:28,510
See that girl? She's gorgeous!

177
00:16:29,588 --> 00:16:32,250
Yeah, just like the heroine
in ''A Touch Of Zen''!

178
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:37,229
Did you see that? She smiled at me!

179
00:16:37,229 --> 00:16:39,465
She was looking at me, silly!

180
00:16:39,465 --> 00:16:41,160
She looked this way!

181
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:45,671
Look over there!

182
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:47,263
YOU look over there!

183
00:17:02,988 --> 00:17:06,287
Greetings, everyone!

184
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:08,193
I'm delighted

185
00:17:08,193 --> 00:17:09,828
to demonstrate for you

186
00:17:09,828 --> 00:17:12,698
my Twin Butterfly Knives stances!

187
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:17,135
But before I do, my daughter would
like to give you something.

188
00:17:18,771 --> 00:17:20,873
Please come and visit my school.

189
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:24,536
I guarantee that you'll be
heaIthier and more fit!

190
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:26,779
Come and visit us.

191
00:17:26,779 --> 00:17:29,111
Your drumming was great!

192
00:17:29,515 --> 00:17:31,039
-Come and visit us.
-Sure.

193
00:17:33,385 --> 00:17:35,148
It's the Hung Gar Fist!

194
00:17:56,875 --> 00:18:00,140
Your horse stance has to be lower!

195
00:18:01,313 --> 00:18:02,780
Harder!

196
00:18:03,015 --> 00:18:04,346
Where's your strength?

197
00:18:05,117 --> 00:18:06,414
Harder!

198
00:18:10,989 --> 00:18:12,991
Hey, it's here!

199
00:18:12,991 --> 00:18:14,927
''Gok's Martial Arts School''

200
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:16,155
Come on!

201
00:18:16,295 --> 00:18:17,663
-Are you sure about this?
-Yes!

202
00:18:17,663 --> 00:18:19,130
You might as well learn something!

203
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:32,641
Hey! Wai!

204
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:35,114
Where did you learn that move?

205
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:37,649
From watching ''The Boxer
From Shantung'', Master.

206
00:18:37,649 --> 00:18:39,718
Always watching Kung Fu films!

207
00:18:39,718 --> 00:18:42,154
It's all fake! They don't know
how to fight!

208
00:18:42,154 --> 00:18:44,323
They fight and fight,
but no one dies!

209
00:18:44,323 --> 00:18:47,059
That actor, Chen Kuan Tai?
He practices cuIt stances!

210
00:18:47,059 --> 00:18:48,694
He knows nothing about
Hung Gar Fist!

211
00:18:48,694 --> 00:18:51,356
Now go to the corner and
practice your horse stance!

212
00:18:52,297 --> 00:18:53,765
-Dad.
-What?

213
00:18:53,765 --> 00:18:55,995
We have new students.

214
00:18:57,636 --> 00:18:59,271
What do you want to learn?

215
00:18:59,271 --> 00:19:01,136
The Butterfly Knives.

216
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:02,608
Why?

217
00:19:02,608 --> 00:19:04,041
For rev -

218
00:19:04,209 --> 00:19:07,045
To protect the country,
strengthen my body,

219
00:19:07,045 --> 00:19:08,910
and to glorify our
Chinese Martial Arts!

220
00:19:10,349 --> 00:19:12,374
At least you have some ambition.

221
00:19:12,818 --> 00:19:13,218
And you?

222
00:19:13,218 --> 00:19:15,618
I want to learn drumming!

223
00:19:16,021 --> 00:19:17,356
Drumming?

224
00:19:17,356 --> 00:19:20,159
Yes, I want to learn this beautiful
tradition of Cheung Chau Island

225
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:22,060
so that we will become
famous throughout Asia,

226
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:24,119
Africa, and even Europe!

227
00:19:27,199 --> 00:19:31,431
Then do you know the rules of
learning kung fu here?

228
00:19:36,308 --> 00:19:39,211
Read them out aloud!

229
00:19:39,211 --> 00:19:40,412
One, respect our Master.

230
00:19:40,412 --> 00:19:42,581
Two, protect our country.

231
00:19:42,581 --> 00:19:44,116
Three, help the weak.

232
00:19:44,116 --> 00:19:45,617
Four, always help others.

233
00:19:45,617 --> 00:19:47,676
Five, pay tuition on time.

234
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:49,388
Good!

235
00:19:49,388 --> 00:19:51,957
Get the Butterfly Knives, honey.

236
00:19:51,957 --> 00:19:53,288
Here, Dad.

237
00:19:56,995 --> 00:20:00,632
These knives have a long history.

238
00:20:00,632 --> 00:20:04,659
I inherited them from my Master.
They are the symbol of our school.

239
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:07,706
I'll tell you their
glorious history later.

240
00:20:07,706 --> 00:20:10,698
I'll just let you hold them today.

241
00:20:16,982 --> 00:20:20,509
I want you two to really
learn your crafts here.

242
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:25,379
Honey, fill out the registration
forms for them.

243
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:29,494
So you're Master Gok's daughter!

244
00:20:29,494 --> 00:20:30,825
What's your name?

245
00:20:31,096 --> 00:20:32,723
I'm Nam.

246
00:20:32,998 --> 00:20:34,932
How old are you?

247
00:20:35,934 --> 00:20:38,337
I just want to know whether
you're older than me.

248
00:20:38,337 --> 00:20:39,838
If you are, then I'll
call you Big Sister.

249
00:20:39,838 --> 00:20:41,773
If you aren't, then I'll
call you Little Sister.

250
00:20:41,773 --> 00:20:43,275
Just call me Nam.

251
00:20:43,275 --> 00:20:44,776
Nam? I'm Ming.

252
00:20:44,776 --> 00:20:47,045
Everyone calls me
''Fishball Ming''.

253
00:20:47,045 --> 00:20:48,444
He is Fan.

254
00:20:48,714 --> 00:20:51,342
How many days do you plan
to attend each week?

255
00:20:51,817 --> 00:20:53,182
Two.

256
00:20:53,619 --> 00:20:55,587
Only two days?

257
00:20:55,587 --> 00:20:57,889
You won't learn much with
two lessons a week.

258
00:20:57,889 --> 00:20:59,413
I'll make it five a week.

259
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:02,461
But two is fine for learning drums.

260
00:21:02,461 --> 00:21:05,157
No! I'll learn kung fu too!

261
00:21:05,731 --> 00:21:07,323
Five days for me too!

262
00:21:10,702 --> 00:21:12,404
She didn't ask you to learn kung fu!

263
00:21:12,404 --> 00:21:14,006
I want to keep you company!

264
00:21:14,006 --> 00:21:15,741
I don't need your company!

265
00:21:15,741 --> 00:21:17,174
What about your sugar cane job?

266
00:21:26,518 --> 00:21:28,220
Oh no!

267
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:31,417
I must have hurt it when we
electrocuted that rat!

268
00:21:31,857 --> 00:21:33,154
What?

269
00:21:33,358 --> 00:21:36,762
I was this close to ''Chivalrous Lady''.

270
00:21:36,762 --> 00:21:38,930
But I wasn't even aroused!

271
00:21:38,930 --> 00:21:41,125
I must have killed all the nerves!

272
00:21:41,433 --> 00:21:44,002
Really? That can be serious!

273
00:21:44,002 --> 00:21:47,403
Of course it is!
I can't make it go bigger!

274
00:21:47,806 --> 00:21:50,604
What if l become...impotent?

275
00:21:51,143 --> 00:21:52,244
All right.

276
00:21:52,244 --> 00:21:54,913
Go and catch the aduIt show
tomorrow morning.

277
00:21:54,913 --> 00:21:56,548
I guarantee you'll be
fine afterwards.

278
00:21:56,548 --> 00:21:57,582
Really?

279
00:21:57,582 --> 00:21:59,311
Trust me.

280
00:21:59,551 --> 00:22:04,318
So whenever you're near girIs,
you'll go like this?

281
00:22:04,456 --> 00:22:06,253
Why? Don't you?

282
00:22:09,294 --> 00:22:11,762
''THE VlRGlN FLOWER BLOOMS''

283
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:25,203
Well? Could you?

284
00:22:25,477 --> 00:22:27,104
Give me a cane.

285
00:22:30,582 --> 00:22:32,984
See! Of course l still could!

286
00:22:32,984 --> 00:22:35,053
See? I told you!

287
00:22:35,053 --> 00:22:36,179
That was a great idea!

288
00:22:46,465 --> 00:22:48,592
Good business, boss!

289
00:22:51,837 --> 00:22:55,466
Good business, granny!

290
00:22:56,408 --> 00:22:58,000
Thanks.

291
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:04,516
What's with you??
All those fancy movements!

292
00:23:04,516 --> 00:23:05,751
What a waste of time!

293
00:23:05,751 --> 00:23:08,083
It's just an Unicorn Dance!
Watch me!

294
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:11,890
Look. Just wave it like this!

295
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:13,118
Idiot!

296
00:23:15,927 --> 00:23:18,122
Start the cymbaIs!

297
00:23:18,563 --> 00:23:20,690
Good business!

298
00:23:24,035 --> 00:23:26,503
Good business, granny!

299
00:23:27,372 --> 00:23:29,040
-This is for you.
-Thanks.

300
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:30,442
Have a sugar cane.

301
00:23:30,442 --> 00:23:32,244
What's your problem,
sugar cane boy?

302
00:23:32,244 --> 00:23:33,979
Always giving me that stare!

303
00:23:33,979 --> 00:23:36,174
Come to the Temple tonight,
if you dare.

304
00:23:50,328 --> 00:23:52,597
Normally, I would go
all the way down.

305
00:23:52,597 --> 00:23:54,622
But since I've split my pants,
I'll just go halfway.

306
00:23:56,802 --> 00:24:00,572
Whoever wins tonight
will work for me.

307
00:24:00,572 --> 00:24:04,030
Whoever loses will have to
fix my pants.

308
00:24:05,076 --> 00:24:08,346
Let me make it clear.
It'll be a no-holds-barred match.

309
00:24:08,346 --> 00:24:10,678
-Curly!
-Here.

310
00:24:11,616 --> 00:24:13,151
What's your stance again?

311
00:24:13,151 --> 00:24:14,743
The Mantis Fist!

312
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:17,711
-Sounds good. Let's see it.
-Yes.

313
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:37,374
Good, good.

314
00:24:37,909 --> 00:24:39,536
-Baldy!
-Here!

315
00:24:40,445 --> 00:24:41,913
What's your style?

316
00:24:41,913 --> 00:24:43,778
The Nine Pa Mei Pushes.

317
00:24:44,216 --> 00:24:45,706
Sounds good. Let's see it.

318
00:24:55,794 --> 00:24:57,455
Good, good.

319
00:24:57,696 --> 00:25:02,367
We'll have a ''Mantis Fist vs
The Nine Pa Mei Pushes'' tonight.

320
00:25:02,367 --> 00:25:03,959
Begin! We'll watch it from up there.

321
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:10,909
What the fuck are you two doing?

322
00:25:10,909 --> 00:25:13,400
Just fight!

323
00:25:23,555 --> 00:25:25,557
What the hell was that??
Choy Li Fut style?

324
00:25:25,557 --> 00:25:27,659
Use your Mantis Fist and
your Nine Pa Mei Pushes!

325
00:25:27,659 --> 00:25:29,217
Where are your styles now?

326
00:25:37,369 --> 00:25:39,004
Clobber him!

327
00:25:39,004 --> 00:25:40,232
Arm lock!

328
00:25:40,438 --> 00:25:41,666
Hit his head...

329
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:43,441
Are you all right, Boss?

330
00:25:43,441 --> 00:25:45,010
-Again??
-Oh no!

331
00:25:45,010 --> 00:25:47,808
It's not bleeding! It's not bleeding!

332
00:25:48,747 --> 00:25:50,482
Motherfucker!

333
00:25:50,482 --> 00:25:53,051
Come down here and
fight me if you dare!

334
00:25:53,051 --> 00:25:54,819
Hiding like a goddamn turtle!

335
00:25:54,819 --> 00:25:57,889
Fuck you! Go to Hell!

336
00:25:57,889 --> 00:26:01,381
Don't let me catch you or
I'll cut your balls off!

337
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:04,462
You're all fucking useless!

338
00:26:04,462 --> 00:26:07,065
It's been more than 10 years now
and you still can't find him!

339
00:26:07,065 --> 00:26:10,466
Do you want him to
crack my head open?

340
00:26:10,635 --> 00:26:15,004
Bastards! All you know is
eating and shitting!

341
00:26:15,206 --> 00:26:16,867
Keep fighting!

342
00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:56,360
That's weird!

343
00:28:56,768 --> 00:28:59,771
Yup. She just disappeared.

344
00:28:59,771 --> 00:29:01,466
You should come with me tonight.

345
00:29:04,275 --> 00:29:05,765
What are you doing?

346
00:29:06,010 --> 00:29:09,741
Can't you see? I'm practicing the
''Golden Fire Eyes'' magic!

347
00:29:10,181 --> 00:29:13,084
Don't worry. Once I master it,

348
00:29:13,084 --> 00:29:15,286
I'll be able to spot
all ghosts and demons!

349
00:29:15,286 --> 00:29:17,447
-''JAMES BOND in LlVE AND LET DIE''
-Are you for real?

350
00:29:18,990 --> 00:29:21,788
Is this the right way?

351
00:29:21,993 --> 00:29:23,324
Yes. Come on!

352
00:29:27,632 --> 00:29:29,190
What is this place?

353
00:29:29,534 --> 00:29:32,002
It should be here.

354
00:29:32,504 --> 00:29:35,073
This is getting scary!

355
00:29:35,073 --> 00:29:37,108
Who cares? Come on!

356
00:29:37,108 --> 00:29:39,269
Who would live here?

357
00:29:40,044 --> 00:29:42,979
Fan, what is this place?

358
00:29:43,314 --> 00:29:46,477
Are you sure you're
on the right path?

359
00:29:47,051 --> 00:29:48,780
No one would live here!

360
00:29:50,622 --> 00:29:54,888
I told Mom I'd be
home for dinner!

361
00:29:55,727 --> 00:29:57,991
Let's go. We'll come
another time.

362
00:29:58,830 --> 00:30:00,730
Hey! Are you all right?

363
00:31:44,335 --> 00:31:47,634
She has to be a ghost!

364
00:31:48,306 --> 00:31:49,908
No way.

365
00:31:49,908 --> 00:31:52,610
Think about it. Why would
a pretty girl like that

366
00:31:52,610 --> 00:31:55,101
live in the woods?

367
00:31:55,313 --> 00:31:57,749
Also, when I fell last night...

368
00:31:57,749 --> 00:31:59,183
Do you know what I saw?

369
00:31:59,183 --> 00:32:00,051
What?

370
00:32:00,051 --> 00:32:01,986
An abandoned graveyard!

371
00:32:01,986 --> 00:32:05,156
The coffins are covered with weeds.
Some of them were even half opened!

372
00:32:05,156 --> 00:32:07,191
I was about to look closer

373
00:32:07,191 --> 00:32:10,762
when I saw a long-haired girl
in white.

374
00:32:10,762 --> 00:32:12,897
She floated towards me.

375
00:32:12,897 --> 00:32:15,266
Then, with a puff of smoke,
she turned into a fox,

376
00:32:15,266 --> 00:32:18,531
and she entered one of the coffins!
I almost pooped in my pants!

377
00:32:18,836 --> 00:32:21,272
Yeah right, and Wu Kum played
the fox!

378
00:32:21,272 --> 00:32:22,607
Try to kid me, huh?

379
00:32:22,607 --> 00:32:23,875
And blocked me?

380
00:32:23,875 --> 00:32:26,244
Let's go see Master tonight

381
00:32:26,244 --> 00:32:28,613
so he can fix your arm.

382
00:32:28,613 --> 00:32:30,915
You should ask him to fix your nose!

383
00:32:30,915 --> 00:32:34,476
You just want to see ''Chivalrous Lady''.
She wouldn't talk to you!

384
00:32:34,652 --> 00:32:36,688
Just go and let him take a look!

385
00:32:36,688 --> 00:32:38,589
Otherwise you'll become a cripple!

386
00:32:38,589 --> 00:32:40,291
Your nose will rot!

387
00:32:40,291 --> 00:32:41,459
Your arm will fall off!

388
00:32:41,459 --> 00:32:42,627
Your face will have scars!

389
00:32:42,627 --> 00:32:43,895
You won't be able to peeI canes!

390
00:32:43,895 --> 00:32:45,886
No squeezing fishballs for you!

391
00:32:46,664 --> 00:32:50,034
You two monkeys! You've been watching
too many Kung Fu films!

392
00:32:50,034 --> 00:32:52,559
You think you're Kung Fu stars now?

393
00:32:52,770 --> 00:32:54,101
Here, Dad.

394
00:32:54,272 --> 00:32:57,041
Starting fights all the time!

395
00:32:57,041 --> 00:33:02,246
You think you can fight? Just because
you know a few moves

396
00:33:02,246 --> 00:33:04,582
doesn't mean you can!

397
00:33:04,582 --> 00:33:06,413
Let me tell you.

398
00:33:06,551 --> 00:33:09,287
Those Kung Fu films?
They are all fake!

399
00:33:09,287 --> 00:33:10,922
No way, Master.

400
00:33:10,922 --> 00:33:12,357
Of course!

401
00:33:12,357 --> 00:33:13,891
Who's that director?

402
00:33:13,891 --> 00:33:15,293
Chang Cheh!

403
00:33:15,293 --> 00:33:17,028
In all of his films,

404
00:33:17,028 --> 00:33:19,664
they all fight with
their guts all falling out!

405
00:33:19,664 --> 00:33:21,599
Cut off someone's arm and he
becomes the ''One Armed Swordsman''!

406
00:33:21,599 --> 00:33:23,201
Their guts are all spilled out,

407
00:33:23,201 --> 00:33:26,796
but they just hold them in
and keep on fighting!

408
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:28,873
Isn't that ridiculous?

409
00:33:28,873 --> 00:33:30,363
Then there's the worst of the lot!

410
00:33:30,608 --> 00:33:32,744
Starring Ti Lung and David Chiang...

411
00:33:32,744 --> 00:33:34,879
What's it called? ''Ven...''

412
00:33:34,879 --> 00:33:36,214
''Vengeance''

413
00:33:36,214 --> 00:33:37,849
Right! ''Vengeance''!

414
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:40,785
All it talks about is revenge!

415
00:33:40,785 --> 00:33:42,954
What a bad model for kids!

416
00:33:42,954 --> 00:33:45,723
And Chang Cheh even won
Best Director for it!

417
00:33:45,723 --> 00:33:48,226
All of you monkeys like to
watch those films.

418
00:33:48,226 --> 00:33:49,989
How can you not turn bad?

419
00:33:50,128 --> 00:33:51,720
Wrap his arm.

420
00:33:51,929 --> 00:33:55,262
I'll come back and tell you the
history of the Butterfly Knives.

421
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:04,409
Does it hurt?

422
00:34:04,409 --> 00:34:05,676
A little.

423
00:34:05,676 --> 00:34:07,041
I want some too!

424
00:34:07,278 --> 00:34:09,678
How? You've got too many cuts.

425
00:34:10,481 --> 00:34:13,348
Then...you can at least rub on it!

426
00:34:14,852 --> 00:34:16,217
Later.

427
00:34:18,623 --> 00:34:23,617
I inherited this pair of Butterfly Knives
from my Master.

428
00:34:23,928 --> 00:34:27,832
Back then, during a
martial arts tournament,

429
00:34:27,832 --> 00:34:32,201
my Master used it against the
Master of the 9-ringed Sword.

430
00:34:33,571 --> 00:34:35,368
However...

431
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:41,367
At the tournament, my Master...

432
00:35:26,991 --> 00:35:29,459
My Master lost.

433
00:35:29,627 --> 00:35:33,859
The 9-ringed Sword
became more popular.

434
00:35:35,032 --> 00:35:37,268
My Master feIt very guiIty.

435
00:35:37,268 --> 00:35:41,038
He knew it wasn't the
Butterfly Knives,

436
00:35:41,038 --> 00:35:45,873
it was because of his own
imperfect skills that failed them.

437
00:35:46,344 --> 00:35:50,114
Therefore, my Master decided to
make these two Butterfly Knives

438
00:35:50,114 --> 00:35:52,650
the heirloom of our school.

439
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:54,352
It is to remind us

440
00:35:54,352 --> 00:35:57,879
that we should never assume
that we're the best!

441
00:35:58,289 --> 00:35:59,624
Do you understand?

442
00:35:59,624 --> 00:36:01,091
Yes!

443
00:36:01,325 --> 00:36:02,485
Keep practicing!

444
00:36:16,307 --> 00:36:19,777
995, 996, 997...

445
00:36:19,777 --> 00:36:22,837
998, 999, 1000.

446
00:36:30,321 --> 00:36:31,856
-Your turn!
-Why?

447
00:36:31,856 --> 00:36:33,858
Why? You think I'm a retard?

448
00:36:33,858 --> 00:36:35,593
A little kid like him
can't kick that hard!

449
00:36:35,593 --> 00:36:39,529
You must have kicked it! Come on!

450
00:36:46,704 --> 00:36:47,636
Thanks.

451
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:57,915
''NOW SHOWlNG''

452
00:36:57,915 --> 00:37:00,213
''ClNDERELLA''

453
00:37:00,551 --> 00:37:02,951
Sugar canes! Sweet and crisp!

454
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:04,280
It's you?!

455
00:37:21,138 --> 00:37:23,106
Were you fighting again?

456
00:37:27,411 --> 00:37:29,345
-I'll help you.
-No need!

457
00:37:37,989 --> 00:37:40,787
You're looking for me?

458
00:37:41,158 --> 00:37:42,921
Have some fishballs!

459
00:37:44,929 --> 00:37:47,732
Dad told me to come and
collect your fees.

460
00:37:47,732 --> 00:37:49,256
You're way overdue.

461
00:37:50,167 --> 00:37:51,828
That's all?

462
00:37:53,504 --> 00:37:55,938
I only have small change.
Do you mind?

463
00:38:02,046 --> 00:38:03,138
Hey!

464
00:38:04,782 --> 00:38:06,617
I didn't mean to peek at you
the other night.

465
00:38:06,617 --> 00:38:08,286
But I was lost, so...

466
00:38:08,286 --> 00:38:09,587
And I saw your house.

467
00:38:09,587 --> 00:38:11,255
There was light upstairs,

468
00:38:11,255 --> 00:38:13,691
so I climbed up the tree to see
if somebody's there.

469
00:38:13,691 --> 00:38:15,559
That's when I saw you.

470
00:38:15,559 --> 00:38:17,295
But I didn't see anything!

471
00:38:17,295 --> 00:38:19,889
Really! I swear I didn't
see anything!

472
00:38:42,787 --> 00:38:44,345
You're not a ghost, right?

473
00:38:46,290 --> 00:38:48,485
You live with them?

474
00:38:49,093 --> 00:38:50,695
You live in a nunnery?

475
00:38:50,695 --> 00:38:52,060
Yes. So?

476
00:38:52,296 --> 00:38:54,958
Then...What's your name?

477
00:38:55,266 --> 00:38:56,927
Why should I tell you?

478
00:38:57,068 --> 00:38:59,263
If you won't tell me, then...

479
00:38:59,370 --> 00:39:00,805
I'll come back tonight
and ask you again.

480
00:39:00,805 --> 00:39:01,639
I dare you!

481
00:39:01,639 --> 00:39:03,004
You just wait and see.

482
00:39:03,741 --> 00:39:06,344
I'm the Decimator, how's that?

483
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:08,141
Decimator? I'm Fan.

484
00:39:08,245 --> 00:39:09,947
You're a nuisance!

485
00:39:09,947 --> 00:39:12,683
What's your phone number,
Decimator?

486
00:39:12,683 --> 00:39:15,151
What now? I don't have a phone!

487
00:39:15,319 --> 00:39:18,322
No phone? So how do I find you?

488
00:39:18,322 --> 00:39:21,291
Why don't you give me your address?
I'll write you letters

489
00:39:25,529 --> 00:39:27,827
and I'll deliver them myself!

490
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:32,530
Just mail it to the convenience store
down the hill.

491
00:39:41,645 --> 00:39:43,135
Use your strength!

492
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:46,841
1 , 2, 3...

493
00:39:50,588 --> 00:39:54,718
Hey, hey! Give me a hand.

494
00:39:55,126 --> 00:39:57,528
Are you really going to write
to that ghost?

495
00:39:57,528 --> 00:40:01,794
Just burn her some paper money
as offerings!

496
00:40:02,066 --> 00:40:04,835
You won't even help me?

497
00:40:04,835 --> 00:40:07,269
Fine. Give me back
my swimming pants!

498
00:40:07,605 --> 00:40:09,129
Give it to me!

499
00:40:24,288 --> 00:40:25,550
Thanks.

500
00:40:27,158 --> 00:40:28,455
I'm done.

501
00:40:30,995 --> 00:40:32,763
''I fell in love

502
00:40:32,763 --> 00:40:36,358
the first time I saw you''

503
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:39,003
That's too direct, you jerk!

504
00:40:39,003 --> 00:40:41,062
But you did! Just admit it!

505
00:40:41,439 --> 00:40:43,474
Can it be something less direct

506
00:40:43,474 --> 00:40:45,271
and more romantic?

507
00:40:45,709 --> 00:40:47,006
Think!

508
00:40:49,747 --> 00:40:52,614
''MELODY''

509
00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:54,042
I've got it!

510
00:40:56,387 --> 00:40:57,588
You read and I'll write.

511
00:40:57,588 --> 00:41:00,124
''A young couple with a lack of
family warmth...''

512
00:41:00,124 --> 00:41:01,926
Too fast!

513
00:41:01,926 --> 00:41:02,927
Okay, slowly...

514
00:41:02,927 --> 00:41:04,595
''A young couple...

515
00:41:04,595 --> 00:41:06,030
How do you spell ''couple''?

516
00:41:06,030 --> 00:41:07,292
Just look!

517
00:41:09,099 --> 00:41:11,829
''MISS DEClMATOR. STORE BY THE HlLL,
LANTAU ISLAND''

518
00:43:33,510 --> 00:43:35,034
Well?

519
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:39,075
''THE FRUIt Is SWELLlNG''

520
00:43:42,319 --> 00:43:44,446
What do we write now?

521
00:43:44,955 --> 00:43:46,479
How about this?

522
00:43:47,424 --> 00:43:50,394
''When a peach swells,

523
00:43:50,394 --> 00:43:52,763
it's sweet and juicy.

524
00:43:52,763 --> 00:43:54,498
Every man who sees it

525
00:43:54,498 --> 00:43:57,067
will be overcome with passion.

526
00:43:57,067 --> 00:43:59,203
I've always longed for a peach.

527
00:43:59,203 --> 00:44:02,001
I wonder if yours is swelling?''

528
00:44:02,272 --> 00:44:04,375
-Juicy my ass!
-I'm just fantasizing!

529
00:44:04,375 --> 00:44:06,172
Don't you want that yourself?

530
00:44:07,077 --> 00:44:09,011
''GlRIfRlEND''

531
00:44:13,651 --> 00:44:17,280
Here are the synopses of all the
movies we've shown.

532
00:44:17,554 --> 00:44:19,715
Thanks, Uncle Kew.

533
00:44:19,957 --> 00:44:22,425
-Take your time.
-Okay.

534
00:44:27,531 --> 00:44:29,333
There are so many here!

535
00:44:29,333 --> 00:44:32,234
These synopses will last us a lifetime!

536
00:44:36,740 --> 00:44:38,469
Look at this!

537
00:44:48,986 --> 00:44:50,578
Which one is this?

538
00:44:51,188 --> 00:44:54,024
''999--WHO'S THE MURDERER''?

539
00:44:54,024 --> 00:44:55,959
That's an old one!

540
00:44:55,959 --> 00:44:57,194
It's been almost 10 years.

541
00:44:57,194 --> 00:44:59,797
I think it starred Cho Tat-wah
and Lin Fung.

542
00:44:59,797 --> 00:45:03,130
During its run, his dad...

543
00:45:04,735 --> 00:45:06,904
My dad didn't kill himself!
He was murdered!

544
00:45:06,904 --> 00:45:08,735
Why wouldn't any of you believe me??

545
00:45:52,850 --> 00:45:54,251
Dinner at 7,

546
00:45:54,251 --> 00:45:56,481
then I'll take you to see
something exciting at 10.

547
00:45:56,754 --> 00:46:00,190
I'll pick you up at 7.
Where do you live?

548
00:46:08,031 --> 00:46:10,868
That's it! Just attack his head!

549
00:46:10,868 --> 00:46:12,859
Where are your strengths??

550
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:18,408
On the ground! Roll!

551
00:46:18,408 --> 00:46:20,035
Sweep him over!

552
00:46:23,747 --> 00:46:26,147
What're you afraid of? Just stab him!

553
00:46:30,387 --> 00:46:32,289
Chop him up! Yes!

554
00:46:32,289 --> 00:46:33,916
You're so violent!

555
00:46:34,825 --> 00:46:37,316
We don't have to watch it!

556
00:46:37,995 --> 00:46:41,465
You want some soda?

557
00:46:41,465 --> 00:46:43,399
I'll buy you a soda.

558
00:46:44,535 --> 00:46:47,070
No soda? We can go and
catch some crabs!

559
00:46:47,070 --> 00:46:48,935
I'll call you!

560
00:46:51,041 --> 00:46:54,408
And to think I bought a
new hat just for her!

561
00:46:55,479 --> 00:46:57,208
Bastard! Not again?!

562
00:46:57,648 --> 00:46:59,249
Don't just stand there!

563
00:46:59,249 --> 00:47:01,919
Wait! Am I bleeding?

564
00:47:01,919 --> 00:47:03,910
Go! Find him!

565
00:47:09,493 --> 00:47:12,053
Fan?! What are you doing here?

566
00:47:21,305 --> 00:47:24,069
So it was ''Crazy'' who killed your dad.

567
00:47:24,875 --> 00:47:26,543
No wonder you hate his guts.

568
00:47:26,543 --> 00:47:28,111
You believe me?

569
00:47:28,111 --> 00:47:29,847
Of course!

570
00:47:29,847 --> 00:47:31,982
You never joke around
about your dad!

571
00:47:31,982 --> 00:47:34,852
Nobody likes that asshole ''Crazy''.

572
00:47:34,852 --> 00:47:37,047
Everyone wants him dead!

573
00:47:38,055 --> 00:47:40,324
As long as you believe me.

574
00:47:40,324 --> 00:47:42,593
But...do you have any proof?

575
00:47:42,593 --> 00:47:45,395
Of course! I saw him crush
my dad to death!

576
00:47:45,395 --> 00:47:47,260
He crushed your dad?

577
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:51,563
You won't understand.

578
00:47:52,669 --> 00:47:54,694
He killed my dad.

579
00:47:54,972 --> 00:47:56,940
I must take revenge for him.

580
00:47:57,641 --> 00:48:00,872
But you'll be in trouble
if you kill him.

581
00:48:01,144 --> 00:48:03,135
You better think it over.

582
00:48:04,281 --> 00:48:06,340
I'll break his head!

583
00:48:07,417 --> 00:48:09,052
No one will know.

584
00:48:09,052 --> 00:48:12,856
Let me do it then!
I hate him too!

585
00:48:12,856 --> 00:48:14,057
-Really?
-Sure!

586
00:48:14,057 --> 00:48:15,922
-Really?
-Give it to me!

587
00:48:17,327 --> 00:48:19,596
Don't just stand there!
We're not catching birds here!

588
00:48:19,596 --> 00:48:22,165
Point that flashlight around!

589
00:48:22,165 --> 00:48:24,759
Look everywhere!

590
00:48:24,868 --> 00:48:27,304
Why are you pointing it
at the Temple, asshole?

591
00:48:27,304 --> 00:48:29,067
The rock came from there!

592
00:48:30,807 --> 00:48:32,009
What's wrong, Boss?

593
00:48:32,009 --> 00:48:32,809
It hurts!

594
00:48:32,809 --> 00:48:34,834
This was even worse!!

595
00:48:38,682 --> 00:48:39,950
What are you doing tonight?

596
00:48:39,950 --> 00:48:41,076
I'm meeting up with Hou.

597
00:48:41,518 --> 00:48:42,746
Hou?

598
00:48:44,755 --> 00:48:47,087
Can you take me to see this movie?

599
00:48:51,895 --> 00:48:54,261
Su...Sure. Let's go.

600
00:48:57,801 --> 00:49:00,565
See? I told you this was
a good synopsis!

601
00:49:01,405 --> 00:49:02,633
Mr. Kuen.

602
00:49:04,274 --> 00:49:05,442
One cane, please.

603
00:49:05,442 --> 00:49:06,568
Get it yourself!

604
00:49:07,344 --> 00:49:09,980
Hey. Aren't you showing
''ROMEO AND JULlET''?

605
00:49:09,980 --> 00:49:11,315
It ended yesterday.

606
00:49:11,315 --> 00:49:12,873
Yesterday?

607
00:49:13,583 --> 00:49:16,780
Holy shit. That's not good.

608
00:49:17,921 --> 00:49:23,325
''At 1 1 :30 am, President Nixon and
his wife got off the plane.

609
00:49:28,332 --> 00:49:35,898
The President examined the PLA
along with Premier Chou En-lai.''

610
00:49:56,226 --> 00:49:59,423
You know what?
That was my very first movie.

611
00:50:01,365 --> 00:50:03,433
We'll go see it when
they show it again.

612
00:50:03,433 --> 00:50:07,204
Great! I love the actress.

613
00:50:07,204 --> 00:50:09,606
Her name is Olivia Hussey.

614
00:50:09,606 --> 00:50:12,575
Those pictures you sent me
were beautiful.

615
00:50:12,809 --> 00:50:14,378
You like them?

616
00:50:14,378 --> 00:50:17,014
I'll ask Uncle Kew for more
and send to you.

617
00:50:17,014 --> 00:50:18,777
Okay. Don't forget!

618
00:50:20,017 --> 00:50:23,418
You...why do you live in a nunnery?

619
00:50:24,821 --> 00:50:29,359
My dad was very poor
when l was born.

620
00:50:29,359 --> 00:50:31,194
Back then, a fortune-teller said

621
00:50:31,194 --> 00:50:33,530
that my birth stars clashed with his,

622
00:50:33,530 --> 00:50:35,623
so they sent me here.

623
00:50:35,932 --> 00:50:37,900
Do you know this plant?

624
00:50:38,802 --> 00:50:41,471
It's called ''Ghost Needles''.

625
00:50:41,471 --> 00:50:45,202
Once fermented, you can use it
to cure arthritis.

626
00:50:45,642 --> 00:50:48,406
And do you know this one?

627
00:50:48,979 --> 00:50:50,247
No.

628
00:50:50,247 --> 00:50:52,015
This is ''Chicken Droppings Vine''.

629
00:50:52,015 --> 00:50:54,279
Perfect for making good preserves.

630
00:50:55,085 --> 00:50:56,386
You're like a little old lady!

631
00:50:56,386 --> 00:50:57,614
What?

632
00:50:59,856 --> 00:51:01,756
I have some ointment.

633
00:51:02,292 --> 00:51:04,021
No, thanks.

634
00:51:04,661 --> 00:51:06,296
So you've always lived here?

635
00:51:06,296 --> 00:51:08,665
Yes, my Master is very nice to me.

636
00:51:08,665 --> 00:51:10,901
She takes care of me
and lets me study,

637
00:51:10,901 --> 00:51:13,267
but she wouldn't let me
go out and play.

638
00:51:13,370 --> 00:51:14,704
Do you have any friends?

639
00:51:14,704 --> 00:51:16,968
Sure. You've seen them.

640
00:51:17,174 --> 00:51:18,869
I have?

641
00:51:24,548 --> 00:51:28,006
Then, will you become one of them?

642
00:51:28,318 --> 00:51:29,683
A nun?

643
00:51:30,287 --> 00:51:33,222
I don't know. Maybe.

644
00:51:34,891 --> 00:51:36,188
Look!

645
00:52:01,351 --> 00:52:03,012
I have to go back now.

646
00:52:07,991 --> 00:52:10,186
Can you loan me your jacket?

647
00:52:28,378 --> 00:52:30,369
Thank you for your birthday gift.

648
00:52:30,981 --> 00:52:32,846
Birthday gift?

649
00:52:35,819 --> 00:52:37,946
I don't know when my birthday is,

650
00:52:38,321 --> 00:52:41,119
but...I like it to be today.

651
00:52:42,993 --> 00:52:45,052
When can I see you again?

652
00:52:50,567 --> 00:52:52,228
The day after tomorrow.

653
00:53:51,561 --> 00:53:53,756
You changed your hair style today.

654
00:53:55,599 --> 00:53:57,692
When can I see you again?

655
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:13,345
''FUNERAIs FOR JULY''

656
00:54:17,988 --> 00:54:20,323
Fan, you're so compassionate!

657
00:54:20,323 --> 00:54:22,689
And at such a young age!

658
00:54:23,159 --> 00:54:25,862
My condolences, Auntie.

659
00:54:25,862 --> 00:54:28,592
Are you coming to the burial too?

660
00:54:31,268 --> 00:54:34,066
Two tickets. Seats K15 and K16.

661
00:54:44,214 --> 00:54:45,882
We'll stuff this bean

662
00:54:45,882 --> 00:54:48,084
into the rat's ass.

663
00:54:48,084 --> 00:54:49,919
Then we'll let it go.

664
00:54:49,919 --> 00:54:52,956
Once the bean expands,

665
00:54:52,956 --> 00:54:54,924
it will block its asshole.

666
00:54:54,924 --> 00:54:58,094
It can't shit, so it'll go crazy

667
00:54:58,094 --> 00:55:00,096
due to constipation,

668
00:55:00,096 --> 00:55:02,360
and end up biting
its family to death!

669
00:55:02,532 --> 00:55:05,626
We can then collect the bodies!

670
00:55:06,102 --> 00:55:08,905
Will it work? Who told you this?

671
00:55:08,905 --> 00:55:10,640
My Grandma!

672
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:13,076
She says it's a long lost art!

673
00:55:13,076 --> 00:55:15,510
You don't believe me? Try it!

674
00:55:17,113 --> 00:55:18,978
Let's try it.

675
00:55:30,060 --> 00:55:31,391
Hey you!

676
00:55:31,528 --> 00:55:34,156
You guys fought with
our boys here last time!

677
00:55:34,798 --> 00:55:35,958
And you.

678
00:55:38,902 --> 00:55:41,871
My brother said you're the cockiest.

679
00:55:42,038 --> 00:55:45,742
I'm the only one responsible
for what happened.

680
00:55:45,742 --> 00:55:48,011
Leave my brothers out of it.

681
00:55:48,011 --> 00:55:50,912
Good. You've got guts. Come on.

682
00:55:51,247 --> 00:55:54,978
-Hey. Are you sure about this?
-Yes!

683
00:56:23,813 --> 00:56:26,805
-Are you all right?
-Well? How are you?

684
00:56:28,218 --> 00:56:30,787
Hey. Are you all right?

685
00:56:30,787 --> 00:56:32,618
Got any cigarettes?

686
00:56:39,996 --> 00:56:41,554
Are you sure you're all right?

687
00:56:43,133 --> 00:56:46,398
-Hey. Where did the bean go?
-That's right.

688
00:56:47,804 --> 00:56:49,704
Let's go.

689
00:57:02,819 --> 00:57:04,684
Are you really okay?

690
00:57:11,194 --> 00:57:14,595
What's wrong with your butt,
brother?

691
00:57:18,268 --> 00:57:20,395
Are you sure?

692
00:57:29,679 --> 00:57:33,216
First, watch my hands.
Then watch how my legs move.

693
00:57:33,216 --> 00:57:34,417
Here we go.

694
00:57:34,417 --> 00:57:36,886
''Snow covers the hilItop''!

695
00:57:36,886 --> 00:57:38,788
''Rhino looks at the Moon''!

696
00:57:38,788 --> 00:57:41,279
''Chain of sleeping dragons''!

697
00:57:44,394 --> 00:57:45,861
Fishball Ming!

698
00:57:46,062 --> 00:57:48,394
Come. Repeat my moves.

699
00:57:57,640 --> 00:57:59,776
All right.

700
00:57:59,776 --> 00:58:02,108
Ready? ''Snow covers the hilItop''!

701
00:58:03,613 --> 00:58:05,638
''Rhino looks at the Moon''!

702
00:58:09,519 --> 00:58:11,612
''Chain of sleeping dragons''!

703
00:58:12,489 --> 00:58:13,751
Stop!

704
00:58:13,923 --> 00:58:15,322
Stand right there.

705
00:58:17,260 --> 00:58:19,028
What kind of a stance was that?

706
00:58:19,028 --> 00:58:21,931
It looks more like Wing Chun
than Hung Gar!

707
00:58:21,931 --> 00:58:23,330
Give me the knives.

708
00:58:23,867 --> 00:58:27,496
You must've seen the film
''Hung Gar and Wing Chun''

709
00:58:27,971 --> 00:58:31,140
and got your stances all screwed up!

710
00:58:31,140 --> 00:58:33,877
I've told you! Those movies are
nothing but lies!

711
00:58:33,877 --> 00:58:36,312
The Hung Gar and Wing Chun
styles are totally different,

712
00:58:36,312 --> 00:58:37,347
not like in the movie!

713
00:58:37,347 --> 00:58:39,716
They mixed them all up. It's a mess!

714
00:58:39,716 --> 00:58:41,150
-Master.
-What?

715
00:58:41,150 --> 00:58:42,385
That movie just opened yesterday

716
00:58:42,385 --> 00:58:44,319
and you've already seen it?

717
00:58:45,388 --> 00:58:47,322
What did you say?

718
00:58:47,624 --> 00:58:50,126
How dare you interrupt me
while I'm talking?!

719
00:58:50,126 --> 00:58:52,295
Where's your discipline?

720
00:58:52,295 --> 00:58:54,786
Go over there and do the
horse stance for two hours!

721
00:58:59,736 --> 00:59:03,206
From now on, if l find
anyone learning those

722
00:59:03,206 --> 00:59:07,143
messed up kung fu moves
from the movies,

723
00:59:07,143 --> 00:59:10,670
I'll break his legs!

724
00:59:10,847 --> 00:59:13,616
Deep horse stance, all of you!

725
00:59:13,616 --> 00:59:16,414
You can't leave until
you get it right!

726
00:59:23,826 --> 00:59:27,196
What the hell is wrong with you?

727
00:59:27,196 --> 00:59:29,499
I haven't shit for days!

728
00:59:29,499 --> 00:59:31,330
I'm leaving early.

729
00:59:49,252 --> 00:59:50,687
Is Ming okay?

730
00:59:50,687 --> 00:59:53,121
He doesn't look good.
Is he sick?

731
00:59:53,590 --> 00:59:54,579
Him?

732
00:59:55,291 --> 00:59:57,486
Yes, he's sick.

733
00:59:57,827 --> 00:59:59,021
But...

734
00:59:59,162 --> 01:00:02,188
He'll feel better if you
ask him yourself.

735
01:00:03,266 --> 01:00:05,894
Actually, I meant to ask you.

736
01:00:07,103 --> 01:00:09,697
Why do you two want to
learn kung fu?

737
01:00:11,441 --> 01:00:15,678
It's normal for boys to
want to learn kung fu.

738
01:00:15,678 --> 01:00:17,077
Why do you ask?

739
01:00:17,313 --> 01:00:18,815
Nothing.

740
01:00:18,815 --> 01:00:21,484
You two don't look like
the kung fu type.

741
01:00:21,484 --> 01:00:23,486
He wants to learn drumming,

742
01:00:23,486 --> 01:00:25,579
and you the Butterfly Knives.

743
01:00:27,023 --> 01:00:30,083
Then why do you learn kung fu?
You're a girl.

744
01:00:30,627 --> 01:00:32,595
I don't know either.

745
01:00:32,595 --> 01:00:35,865
My dad had always
wanted me to learn it.

746
01:00:35,865 --> 01:00:39,961
He said he wants to glorify
the Chinese Martial Arts.

747
01:00:41,638 --> 01:00:44,140
Your dad has been watching
too many movies.

748
01:00:44,140 --> 01:00:45,835
He thinks you're the ''Chivalrous Lady''
from ''A TOUCH OF ZEN''.

749
01:00:45,942 --> 01:00:47,343
My mom was a real
chivalrous lady.

750
01:00:47,343 --> 01:00:49,779
Her rank is even higher
than my dad's.

751
01:00:49,779 --> 01:00:53,010
Her grandfather was the founder
of Yang style Tai Chi.

752
01:00:54,217 --> 01:00:56,352
My dad really loved my mom.

753
01:00:56,352 --> 01:00:59,756
But she got ill and passed away

754
01:00:59,756 --> 01:01:02,623
not long after I was born.

755
01:01:03,426 --> 01:01:05,628
You're ranked pretty high then!

756
01:01:05,628 --> 01:01:07,528
I sure am!

757
01:01:10,199 --> 01:01:11,598
Hey.

758
01:01:12,969 --> 01:01:14,960
Do you have a girIfriend?

759
01:01:18,875 --> 01:01:20,672
It's gone.

760
01:01:25,782 --> 01:01:29,775
Are...are you free tomorrow?

761
01:01:38,861 --> 01:01:41,352
My God. How could this happen?

762
01:01:43,199 --> 01:01:46,726
Step aside! Mind your own business!

763
01:01:47,837 --> 01:01:49,405
Hou! What's going on?

764
01:01:49,405 --> 01:01:50,640
Don't you know?

765
01:01:50,640 --> 01:01:51,841
Ming went crazy at home

766
01:01:51,841 --> 01:01:53,176
and started biting his whole family!

767
01:01:53,176 --> 01:01:55,872
His brother called the cops.
They're taking him to the hospital now.

768
01:01:56,879 --> 01:01:58,244
I'll be back, Grandma.

769
01:02:01,217 --> 01:02:03,685
I bought two tickets for the 5:30 show.

770
01:02:10,193 --> 01:02:12,753
''A TOUCH OF ZEN''

771
01:03:40,483 --> 01:03:41,677
Ming!

772
01:03:43,452 --> 01:03:44,919
Are you all right?

773
01:03:47,757 --> 01:03:49,859
The doctor said I've got rabies.

774
01:03:49,859 --> 01:03:51,594
I'll be staying here for a while.

775
01:03:51,594 --> 01:03:54,495
We shouldn't play with rats anymore.

776
01:03:56,899 --> 01:03:59,235
Rabies? That's it?

777
01:03:59,235 --> 01:04:02,602
Why were you so worried just now?

778
01:04:04,106 --> 01:04:05,541
Nothing.

779
01:04:05,541 --> 01:04:08,408
And...don't tell Chivalrous Lady.

780
01:04:08,477 --> 01:04:10,342
I'll write to her myself.

781
01:04:13,583 --> 01:04:15,483
You get some rest.

782
01:04:15,918 --> 01:04:17,317
I'm going now.

783
01:04:17,753 --> 01:04:20,153
You know what?

784
01:04:20,790 --> 01:04:23,281
I think I'm really in love
with Chivalrous Lady.

785
01:04:25,695 --> 01:04:29,461
I used to get aroused
whenever l was near her.

786
01:04:30,766 --> 01:04:32,635
But now I'm lying here,

787
01:04:32,635 --> 01:04:35,536
and I get aroused just
thinking about her.

788
01:04:35,972 --> 01:04:39,203
I wonder...is that love?

789
01:04:41,010 --> 01:04:42,602
I guess.

790
01:04:43,012 --> 01:04:46,675
But...try not to think too much.

791
01:04:47,083 --> 01:04:49,278
It's not good for you.

792
01:04:50,086 --> 01:04:51,687
Have you seen her lately?

793
01:04:51,687 --> 01:04:55,783
Chivalrous Lady? No. No.

794
01:04:56,359 --> 01:04:59,522
I'm going now. Don't think too much.

795
01:05:00,062 --> 01:05:02,999
Why're you in such a hurry?

796
01:05:02,999 --> 01:05:05,801
It's getting dark. I think...

797
01:05:05,801 --> 01:05:07,436
I think she's about to come out.

798
01:05:07,436 --> 01:05:09,597
You're going to look for
that ghost again?

799
01:05:12,875 --> 01:05:14,342
Fate!

800
01:05:15,077 --> 01:05:15,702
Fate indeed!

801
01:07:40,856 --> 01:07:42,653
What are you doing here?

802
01:07:43,793 --> 01:07:45,727
I want to see you.

803
01:07:49,832 --> 01:07:51,527
You hurt your hand!

804
01:08:14,323 --> 01:08:16,723
I will get you out of here.

805
01:08:29,004 --> 01:08:30,306
Are you taking a shower, sister?

806
01:08:30,306 --> 01:08:31,773
Yes!

807
01:08:43,285 --> 01:08:46,652
''That light smile on your face

808
01:08:47,690 --> 01:08:51,023
are you aware of its magic?

809
01:08:52,061 --> 01:08:55,997
It stirs my lonely heart

810
01:08:56,532 --> 01:09:01,401
and takes my spirits away

811
01:09:01,971 --> 01:09:08,001
I am trapped. How can I be with you?

812
01:09:09,612 --> 01:09:13,013
That light smile on your face

813
01:09:13,983 --> 01:09:17,441
shines like a moon

814
01:09:18,354 --> 01:09:22,825
I hope that we can
always be together

815
01:09:22,825 --> 01:09:27,694
and share every second and minute

816
01:09:28,230 --> 01:09:35,227
I wish we will always be
a pair of lovebirds

817
01:09:35,804 --> 01:09:39,672
That light smile on your face

818
01:09:40,209 --> 01:09:44,043
has already locked my heart

819
01:09:44,580 --> 01:09:48,641
Dreams fill my heart and mind

820
01:09:48,884 --> 01:09:52,752
as I think about you til dawn

821
01:09:53,255 --> 01:09:56,918
That cute smile on your face

822
01:09:57,726 --> 01:10:01,423
encompasses both sadness
and joy

823
01:10:02,064 --> 01:10:06,057
But sometimes, love can turn to hate

824
01:10:06,402 --> 01:10:11,032
and hearts can be broken
in an instant

825
01:10:11,774 --> 01:10:18,873
The dream is now over,
and she's no longer here

826
01:10:43,072 --> 01:10:46,599
That light smile on your face

827
01:10:47,309 --> 01:10:51,302
has already locked my heart

828
01:10:51,847 --> 01:10:55,985
Dreams fill my heart and mind

829
01:10:55,985 --> 01:10:59,819
as I think about you til dawn

830
01:11:00,456 --> 01:11:04,119
That cute smile on your face

831
01:11:04,827 --> 01:11:07,630
encompasses both sadness
and joy...''

832
01:11:07,630 --> 01:11:10,098
Boss! Is it a boy or a girl?

833
01:11:11,667 --> 01:11:14,602
-Boy, boy!
-All right!

834
01:11:18,641 --> 01:11:19,508
I'm fine!

835
01:11:19,508 --> 01:11:20,907
Cheers!

836
01:11:21,043 --> 01:11:22,533
God damn it!

837
01:11:27,516 --> 01:11:34,820
''The dream is now over,
and she's no longer here''

838
01:12:18,500 --> 01:12:20,627
You wrote all these letters?

839
01:12:23,138 --> 01:12:26,942
All the stories sounded like
movie synopses.

840
01:12:26,942 --> 01:12:28,544
Really?

841
01:12:28,544 --> 01:12:30,813
Well, life is just like in the movies.

842
01:12:30,813 --> 01:12:33,475
You copied them! Just admit it!

843
01:12:33,749 --> 01:12:36,085
I don't care. As long as I can
convince you.

844
01:12:36,085 --> 01:12:37,986
Did I say I am convinced?

845
01:12:37,986 --> 01:12:39,054
I think they're disgusting.

846
01:12:39,054 --> 01:12:41,490
But they're all from my heart!

847
01:12:41,490 --> 01:12:43,759
Why are you holding a sword?

848
01:12:43,759 --> 01:12:46,962
Your body is weak, so I wanted to
teach you the Tai Chi Sword style.

849
01:12:46,962 --> 01:12:50,999
That's good. Hung Gar is
too difficuIt for me.

850
01:12:50,999 --> 01:12:53,229
Tai Chi is much better!

851
01:12:55,637 --> 01:12:58,629
Watch it! Or I'll chop your hand off!

852
01:12:58,941 --> 01:13:02,069
You wouldn't!
I just got out of the hospital!

853
01:14:01,770 --> 01:14:03,533
Don't wet your pants now.

854
01:14:05,340 --> 01:14:07,900
Hey, Sugar Cane Boy!
Taking a piss?

855
01:14:09,311 --> 01:14:12,678
Let me pull up your pants for you.

856
01:14:14,783 --> 01:14:16,614
Let's go back to the movies.

857
01:14:18,987 --> 01:14:21,512
What's that? What's that??

858
01:14:23,325 --> 01:14:26,351
I'm asking you! What's that??

859
01:14:26,829 --> 01:14:29,593
So you're the one who
shot me over the years!

860
01:14:30,098 --> 01:14:32,896
You killed my dad! I must avenge him!

861
01:14:33,035 --> 01:14:35,435
Are you nuts? I killed your dad?

862
01:14:36,738 --> 01:14:39,541
I didn't kill him. He killed himself.

863
01:14:39,541 --> 01:14:42,009
Everyone in Cheung Chau knows that!

864
01:14:43,145 --> 01:14:45,714
He lost all his money gambling.

865
01:14:45,714 --> 01:14:47,883
The cops were investigating him
and he had nowhere to go.

866
01:14:47,883 --> 01:14:49,952
He killed himself out of fear,
you idiot!

867
01:14:49,952 --> 01:14:52,554
Dad didn't kill himself!
He was murdered!

868
01:14:52,554 --> 01:14:54,656
He was a highly decorated officer,
a good cop!

869
01:14:54,656 --> 01:14:57,454
You killed him! Just admit it!

870
01:14:59,294 --> 01:15:01,387
Listen, kid.

871
01:15:01,563 --> 01:15:03,632
You think it's easy to kill someone?

872
01:15:03,632 --> 01:15:05,234
Like it is in the movies?

873
01:15:05,234 --> 01:15:08,403
I haven't even stepped on an ant!

874
01:15:08,403 --> 01:15:10,772
I saw you crush a frog
with my own eyes!

875
01:15:10,772 --> 01:15:13,542
When have I ever crushed a frog?

876
01:15:13,542 --> 01:15:15,874
You've gone crazy from
thinking about your dad!

877
01:15:16,578 --> 01:15:17,670
Fine.

878
01:15:21,149 --> 01:15:24,286
Here's your chance.
Kill me, if you dare.

879
01:15:24,286 --> 01:15:26,754
Come on! Kill me! Kill me!!

880
01:15:32,261 --> 01:15:33,428
What?

881
01:15:33,428 --> 01:15:34,930
One day, I will kill you!

882
01:15:34,930 --> 01:15:35,931
What?

883
01:15:35,931 --> 01:15:37,728
You just wait and see!

884
01:15:40,135 --> 01:15:43,901
Kill me? You wouldn't have the guts!

885
01:15:45,707 --> 01:15:47,442
My son is with me today.

886
01:15:47,442 --> 01:15:50,434
Otherwise, I would've
cut your balls off!

887
01:15:51,880 --> 01:15:57,216
I stepped on a frog 10 years ago
and he even remembers that?

888
01:16:12,401 --> 01:16:14,469
Have you heard the news? Fan is going to
have a duel with Crazy!

889
01:16:14,469 --> 01:16:15,697
What?? When?

890
01:16:15,771 --> 01:16:17,329
In two nights, at the temple!

891
01:16:17,639 --> 01:16:18,833
''TWIN DRAGONS''

892
01:16:27,082 --> 01:16:28,413
Fan!

893
01:16:48,804 --> 01:16:50,105
What's with him?

894
01:16:50,105 --> 01:16:52,374
He's been punching the bag
ever since he got here.

895
01:16:52,374 --> 01:16:53,809
He says he and Crazy are
going to have a duel.

896
01:16:53,809 --> 01:16:55,538
-A duel?
-Yes!

897
01:16:57,379 --> 01:17:01,116
You can punch a bag,
but can you beat him?

898
01:17:01,116 --> 01:17:03,448
Think you'll win after
just a few lessons?

899
01:17:03,752 --> 01:17:06,355
I don't want to win! I'm just
not afraid of him anymore!!

900
01:17:06,355 --> 01:17:08,724
WE are afraid! You're going to die!

901
01:17:08,724 --> 01:17:11,460
I can fight in your place!
I'm a better fighter!

902
01:17:11,460 --> 01:17:13,328
Or we can ask Chivalrous Lady!

903
01:17:13,328 --> 01:17:15,455
JUST LEAVE ME ALONE!!

904
01:17:19,401 --> 01:17:21,767
Beat me. Then you can do
whatever you want.

905
01:17:28,610 --> 01:17:29,542
I'm warning you!

906
01:17:34,383 --> 01:17:36,817
Why did you hit him so hard?

907
01:17:37,853 --> 01:17:39,115
He knows why.

908
01:17:39,655 --> 01:17:42,522
He does? But I don't!

909
01:17:51,133 --> 01:17:53,931
Don't call me ''Chivalrous Lady''
anymore.

910
01:18:00,942 --> 01:18:04,713
Mr. Turtle. You're always
hiding in your shell.

911
01:18:04,713 --> 01:18:06,578
Aren't you bored?

912
01:18:06,982 --> 01:18:09,317
Have you been to Hong Kong?

913
01:18:09,317 --> 01:18:12,582
Have you seen the outside world?

914
01:18:20,195 --> 01:18:22,129
Bishop!

915
01:18:22,798 --> 01:18:26,234
Mayor, I've heard that the kid
trains in Hung Gar.

916
01:18:26,234 --> 01:18:28,470
His Master is Gok Bill!

917
01:18:28,470 --> 01:18:32,340
He made this really vicious
looking lion head

918
01:18:32,340 --> 01:18:34,376
at last year's Lion Dance!

919
01:18:34,376 --> 01:18:36,611
So? Crazy studied Choy Li Fut!

920
01:18:36,611 --> 01:18:39,045
He's much more experienced
than that kid!

921
01:18:39,214 --> 01:18:40,682
But still!

922
01:18:40,682 --> 01:18:42,751
''A blind fist can kill
the Old Master''

923
01:18:42,751 --> 01:18:44,446
That's right! Haven't you heard?

924
01:18:44,519 --> 01:18:46,788
''Youth exceIs at fists, and elder
exceIs in weapons''!

925
01:18:46,788 --> 01:18:48,881
Oh, yeah?

926
01:18:49,057 --> 01:18:51,326
What are the 5 best styles
of Southern Boxing?

927
01:18:51,326 --> 01:18:52,661
There are 5??

928
01:18:52,661 --> 01:18:54,629
Of course! I'll tell you!

929
01:18:54,629 --> 01:18:57,466
They're Hung, Lau, Choy,
Lee, and Mok!

930
01:18:57,466 --> 01:18:58,700
Have you heard of them?

931
01:18:58,700 --> 01:19:01,570
So which is better?
Choy Li Fut or Hung Gar?

932
01:19:01,570 --> 01:19:03,505
I'll tell you.

933
01:19:03,505 --> 01:19:06,274
Hung Hei-kwun founded Hung Gar,

934
01:19:06,274 --> 01:19:09,344
and Chan Heung founded Choy Li Fut.

935
01:19:09,344 --> 01:19:10,846
Cut the bullshit!

936
01:19:10,846 --> 01:19:13,715
So are you betting on
Crazy or the kid?

937
01:19:13,715 --> 01:19:14,909
That's right!

938
01:19:16,918 --> 01:19:17,942
Checkmate!

939
01:19:46,882 --> 01:19:48,984
Master knows about us.

940
01:19:48,984 --> 01:19:50,919
I may never see you again.

941
01:19:50,919 --> 01:19:53,080
Will you take me away tonight?

942
01:19:55,056 --> 01:19:57,650
I'll wait for you at the pier.
Don't forget.

943
01:20:15,143 --> 01:20:17,412
Have some more.

944
01:20:17,412 --> 01:20:18,902
Thanks.

945
01:20:19,781 --> 01:20:21,578
You too.

946
01:20:23,118 --> 01:20:24,949
Have some more.

947
01:20:34,930 --> 01:20:37,091
I'm going, Grandma.

948
01:20:39,067 --> 01:20:42,093
Take this. It's going
to rain tonight.

949
01:20:47,242 --> 01:20:49,870
Come back soon. It's the Moon Festival.

950
01:21:02,424 --> 01:21:04,984
You've got to win, Brother Fan.

951
01:21:23,745 --> 01:21:24,871
Fan!

952
01:21:28,617 --> 01:21:31,085
You won't lose with these.

953
01:22:20,001 --> 01:22:22,037
Looks like Brother Crazy
won't be coming.

954
01:22:22,037 --> 01:22:24,028
He probably doesn't want to
bully a kid.

955
01:22:24,606 --> 01:22:27,370
Maybe he doesn't dare to come!

956
01:22:27,442 --> 01:22:30,070
He's 20 years older!

957
01:22:30,145 --> 01:22:32,204
It's going to be hard on him.

958
01:23:11,086 --> 01:23:13,755
What's with Brother Crazy?
Is he drunk?

959
01:23:13,755 --> 01:23:16,849
Maybe it's the
Drunken Sword Style!

960
01:23:23,465 --> 01:23:25,667
Kick his ass!

961
01:23:25,667 --> 01:23:29,037
Chop his head off!

962
01:23:29,037 --> 01:23:32,302
Fight him, Fan!

963
01:23:47,922 --> 01:23:49,357
What the hell was that?

964
01:23:49,357 --> 01:23:51,960
-Doesn't he know how to fight?
-What's with Brother Crazy tonight?

965
01:23:51,960 --> 01:23:54,326
-Maybe he hasn't eaten.
-He's totally not in his element!

966
01:25:37,499 --> 01:25:40,635
-Brother Crazy!
-Brother Crazy!

967
01:25:40,635 --> 01:25:42,437
-Are you all right?
-Hold on!

968
01:25:42,437 --> 01:25:43,927
After him!

969
01:26:02,357 --> 01:26:04,188
Come back!

970
01:26:05,326 --> 01:26:06,987
Let him go.

971
01:27:07,422 --> 01:27:09,691
I thought you wouldn't come!

972
01:27:09,691 --> 01:27:11,886
It's okay now. Let's go.

973
01:27:12,026 --> 01:27:13,516
Where are we going?

974
01:27:15,230 --> 01:27:16,891
To Hong Kong.

975
01:27:28,243 --> 01:27:32,475
Fan! Fan!

976
01:27:33,014 --> 01:27:34,413
Fan!!

977
01:27:34,649 --> 01:27:36,412
Crazy is still alive!

978
01:27:38,086 --> 01:27:39,417
Crazy! He...

979
01:27:40,521 --> 01:27:41,488
What?

980
01:27:42,924 --> 01:27:44,892
Nothing. Go!

981
01:27:44,892 --> 01:27:46,257
And don't come back!

982
01:27:48,062 --> 01:27:50,030
Take care of my Grandma!

983
01:27:51,933 --> 01:27:53,628
I will!

984
01:28:18,293 --> 01:28:19,127
Hello?

985
01:28:19,127 --> 01:28:20,754
Hello? Fan?

986
01:28:21,062 --> 01:28:23,131
Can you come back this Saturday?

987
01:28:23,131 --> 01:28:25,366
What is it? I'm busy here.

988
01:28:25,366 --> 01:28:26,924
Why don't you come out here?

989
01:28:27,001 --> 01:28:28,903
I'll tell you when you come back.

990
01:28:28,903 --> 01:28:31,098
It's urgent. Just come back.

991
01:28:31,539 --> 01:28:33,404
Fine. That's it then.

992
01:29:05,139 --> 01:29:06,538
How did this happen?

993
01:29:08,576 --> 01:29:10,806
He died of a brain tumor.

994
01:29:12,914 --> 01:29:14,506
I thought I...

995
01:29:16,250 --> 01:29:19,242
He lost to you on purpose
that night.

996
01:29:21,989 --> 01:29:25,393
We heard that he couldn't bear
to leave his son behind.

997
01:29:25,393 --> 01:29:28,760
He asked someone to tell me
before he died

998
01:29:28,996 --> 01:29:31,658
that he really didn't kill your dad.

999
01:30:08,770 --> 01:30:10,203
half.

1000
01:30:10,371 --> 01:30:14,330
half?

1001
01:30:14,475 --> 01:30:16,773
All right, half.

1002
01:30:24,585 --> 01:30:25,882
Son.

1003
01:30:26,988 --> 01:30:29,582
Here, son. Have a smoke.

1004
01:30:30,958 --> 01:30:34,291
I'll never be able to smoke with you.

1005
01:30:41,969 --> 01:30:43,766
Open your mouth.

1006
01:30:50,878 --> 01:30:54,370
What do you want to do
when you grow up?

1007
01:30:54,916 --> 01:30:56,577
I don't know.

1008
01:30:57,118 --> 01:31:00,519
Just don't be a nobody, like your dad.

1009
01:31:01,456 --> 01:31:03,524
Study hard.

1010
01:31:03,524 --> 01:31:06,357
Go to Hong Kong and
become an office clerk.

1011
01:31:06,627 --> 01:31:10,825
It's a good job.
It's classy, and it pays well.

1012
01:31:11,098 --> 01:31:14,363
People respect you in a suit.

1013
01:31:15,703 --> 01:31:19,104
Don't be a Cheung Chau gangster
for life.

1014
01:31:21,108 --> 01:31:28,049
Didn't we come here to play
the last time?

1015
01:31:28,049 --> 01:31:31,280
Yes, we came here to play last time.

1016
01:31:32,220 --> 01:31:36,486
But Daddy won't be able to do that
with you anymore.

1017
01:31:37,158 --> 01:31:40,495
Don't miss Daddy even if
Daddy is not here.

1018
01:31:40,495 --> 01:31:43,055
Nothing is too hard to handle.

1019
01:31:43,664 --> 01:31:48,067
You're a man. You can't do great things
if you're a sissy!

1020
01:32:41,088 --> 01:32:43,556
Hey. It's not your fault.

1021
01:32:44,191 --> 01:32:47,160
Your slingshots didn't cause his tumor.

1022
01:33:02,410 --> 01:33:05,112
I've held two tickets for you, Master Gok.

1023
01:33:05,112 --> 01:33:05,913
Thanks.

1024
01:33:05,913 --> 01:33:06,714
You're welcome.

1025
01:33:06,714 --> 01:33:08,011
-$7?
-Thanks.

1026
01:33:20,628 --> 01:33:21,963
Like this?

1027
01:33:21,963 --> 01:33:25,228
No, like this!

1028
01:33:26,567 --> 01:33:28,762
Bravo! That was good!

1029
01:33:48,889 --> 01:33:50,254
Do you know?

1030
01:33:50,691 --> 01:33:53,091
Hou went to Holland with his dad.

1031
01:33:53,527 --> 01:33:54,050
Really?

1032
01:33:55,596 --> 01:33:58,690
Now the Temple is all quiet.

1033
01:34:00,368 --> 01:34:02,236
Those gangsters all went to Hong Kong,

1034
01:34:02,236 --> 01:34:04,431
and they all became killers.

1035
01:34:04,839 --> 01:34:08,138
Remember Crazy's best fighter, Fo-tan?

1036
01:34:08,776 --> 01:34:11,078
I saw him in the news
the other day

1037
01:34:11,078 --> 01:34:12,773
when he was arrested.

1038
01:34:13,314 --> 01:34:16,511
Murder. He got almost 20 years.

1039
01:34:20,254 --> 01:34:23,314
How's your Chivalrous Lady?

1040
01:34:23,658 --> 01:34:24,920
She's doing good.

1041
01:34:25,426 --> 01:34:27,917
She wants to have a drink
with you sometime.

1042
01:34:28,596 --> 01:34:32,032
Also, she wants to apologize
for hurting you.

1043
01:34:32,800 --> 01:34:37,169
Stay and do the Lion Dance at the
Tin Hau Festival with me!

1044
01:34:37,905 --> 01:34:40,533
Didn't you like watching her drumming?

1045
01:34:46,347 --> 01:34:48,815
Well? What about that ghost of yours?

1046
01:34:50,618 --> 01:34:51,752
Her?

1047
01:34:51,752 --> 01:34:53,686
She left.

1048
01:34:54,088 --> 01:34:55,521
She left?

1049
01:34:55,790 --> 01:34:57,155
Why?

1050
01:34:58,392 --> 01:34:59,416
I don't know.

1051
01:35:00,628 --> 01:35:04,689
She took me to this
Buddhist Temple one day.

1052
01:35:05,733 --> 01:35:07,997
She said she wanted to pray for me.

1053
01:35:08,369 --> 01:35:11,702
But when I came out, she was gone.

1054
01:35:11,906 --> 01:35:14,534
So she Is a ghost after all!

1055
01:35:16,577 --> 01:35:20,214
After she left, I took her turtle back

1056
01:35:20,214 --> 01:35:22,341
to her old nunnery.

1057
01:36:10,664 --> 01:36:11,995
Perhaps...

1058
01:36:12,566 --> 01:36:14,796
She just wanted to fly away.

1059
01:36:19,807 --> 01:36:22,209
Fan, I'll come back for you!

1060
01:36:22,209 --> 01:36:23,944
I just want to see this world!

1061
01:36:23,944 --> 01:36:25,741
I will come back for you!

1062
01:36:47,535 --> 01:36:49,662
Hey! Have you had lunch yet?
