1
00:00:26,009 --> 00:00:28,000
-You know Mom hates when I'm late.
-I told you...

2
00:00:28,211 --> 00:00:31,203
we should have left earlier.
It's the same damn thing every year.

3
00:00:31,414 --> 00:00:34,144
It's always: "Where are my
blue shoes, dear?"

4
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:36,978
Or: "Dad, I can't find
my Marilyn Bronson CD."

5
00:00:37,387 --> 00:00:39,753
-Marilyn Manson.
-Whatever her name is.

6
00:00:39,956 --> 00:00:43,016
-She's a guy, dad.
-Marilyn? A guy?

7
00:00:45,261 --> 00:00:47,525
What's the world coming to?

8
00:01:57,667 --> 00:01:59,931
-Oh, boy...
-Are you all right, darling?

9
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:01,837
Yeah.

10
00:02:24,928 --> 00:02:26,327
Dad! Dad!

11
00:02:34,671 --> 00:02:37,139
Oh, God!

12
00:02:37,907 --> 00:02:39,738
My God, what happened?

13
00:02:39,943 --> 00:02:41,706
-Are we there yet?
-ls anybody hurt?

14
00:02:41,911 --> 00:02:44,141
-Marion, are you okay?
-Are you crazy?

15
00:02:44,347 --> 00:02:47,748
-You almost killed us!
-I'm sorry. I must have dozed off.

16
00:02:47,951 --> 00:02:50,419
I hope you slept well. Maybe
I should whip you up some breakfast.

17
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:53,418
Nobody is hurt.
Get off my back, all right?

18
00:02:53,623 --> 00:02:55,853
For Pete's sakes, why don't you
let someone else drive, for once?

19
00:02:56,059 --> 00:02:58,425
Don't worry.
That woke me up.

20
00:02:59,863 --> 00:03:02,855
The pie is probably ruined.

21
00:03:03,066 --> 00:03:04,431
-Oh, Jesus!
-What is that?

22
00:03:04,634 --> 00:03:07,603
-It's pumpkin and chocolate.
-Smells like ass.

23
00:03:08,838 --> 00:03:11,102
I'd better go out and check the car.

24
00:03:21,551 --> 00:03:24,019
The son of a bitch didn't even stop!

25
00:03:24,721 --> 00:03:28,020
-Where are we?
-We're on the road.

26
00:03:28,224 --> 00:03:31,455
-What does it look like?
-What happened to the lnterstate?

27
00:03:31,694 --> 00:03:34,663
I thought we could take
the back-way for a change.

28
00:03:35,098 --> 00:03:37,157
What's wrong with the lnterstate?
We've taken it for years!

29
00:03:37,367 --> 00:03:39,096
I was bored.

30
00:03:39,302 --> 00:03:41,532
And I didn't wanna... fall asleep.

31
00:03:42,205 --> 00:03:45,436
-That seemed to work.
-All right.

32
00:03:46,576 --> 00:03:51,013
Car looks okay.
No damage.

33
00:03:52,982 --> 00:03:56,418
-Want me to take the wheel, dad?
-No, thank you, dear.

34
00:03:56,853 --> 00:04:00,550
-I'm growing attached to this car.
-Here we go again.

35
00:04:00,757 --> 00:04:03,988
Did you or did you not put
the Mercedes in the junkyard?

36
00:04:04,193 --> 00:04:06,821
-lt wasn't my fault!
-I'm just teasing you, sweetheart.

37
00:04:34,724 --> 00:04:37,215
There certainly aren't
very many people on this road.

38
00:04:37,427 --> 00:04:41,921
It's Christmas Eve. Most people
are at home, with their families.

39
00:04:42,131 --> 00:04:44,531
-Damn, I'm starving!
-Me too.

40
00:04:45,301 --> 00:04:47,531
I hope your mother doesn't get
experimental with that turkey.

41
00:04:47,737 --> 00:04:50,331
Look, can we drop the subject?
I don't feel very good.

42
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:52,872
Are you okay, honey-bunny?
You want us to stop?

43
00:04:53,076 --> 00:04:58,139
Long car rides make me queasy. And
all this talk food isn't helping any.

44
00:04:58,348 --> 00:05:03,081
-How about a couple of bookers?
-Shut up, Richard!

45
00:05:03,286 --> 00:05:07,086
-Or some Macaroni and dick-cheese.
-Richard, that's disgusting!

46
00:05:07,290 --> 00:05:12,159
But, mom, there really is a cheese
called dick-cheese. Chinese make it.

47
00:05:14,097 --> 00:05:16,793
You've had dick-cheese before,
right, Brad?

48
00:05:19,669 --> 00:05:23,537
-Grow up, Richard.
-It's 7:30 already, darling.

49
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:27,699
I'm aware of that, Laura. I thought
we'd come to a junction by now.

50
00:05:30,013 --> 00:05:32,846
Jesus, Laura, do you have
to suck on it like that?

51
00:05:34,484 --> 00:05:38,978
-That's the way I drink.
-All right, you guys. Calm down.

52
00:05:39,222 --> 00:05:41,281
-Take it easy.
-Marion is right.

53
00:05:41,724 --> 00:05:46,024
When I played baseball, they taught
us this technique to help us relax.

54
00:05:46,763 --> 00:05:48,253
I still use it sometimes.

55
00:05:48,464 --> 00:05:54,130
You breathe in deeply through your
nose and out through your mouth.

56
00:05:57,373 --> 00:05:59,273
Thank you, Brad.

57
00:05:59,542 --> 00:06:01,373
Yeah, thanks, Brad.

58
00:06:01,744 --> 00:06:04,941
-Can I ask you a question, though?
-Sure.

59
00:06:05,148 --> 00:06:07,673
Was your entire school gay,
or was it just the baseball team?

60
00:06:07,884 --> 00:06:09,647
-Richard!
-What?

61
00:06:10,153 --> 00:06:15,022
Richard, it's a technique we use
to helps us get in what we call...

62
00:06:15,224 --> 00:06:16,782
..."The Zone".
-The Homo Zone?

63
00:06:16,993 --> 00:06:18,654
Richard!

64
00:06:28,604 --> 00:06:31,539
This is such a beautiful night!

65
00:06:31,741 --> 00:06:35,268
Does anybody know the name of that
really bright star right in front of us?

66
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:39,608
There's 1 50 billion stars
up there, for Christ's sake.

67
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:48,587
That one I know. That bright one is
the North Star. The only one I know.

68
00:06:49,992 --> 00:06:51,755
Thank you.

69
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:08,204
-Let's sing a song, everybody.
-Okay. What?

70
00:07:08,411 --> 00:07:12,108
-How about "Yellow Submarine"?
-We always do that one.

71
00:07:12,348 --> 00:07:17,615
-Brad, how about "Y.M.C.A"?
-It's Christmas, so how about...

72
00:07:18,855 --> 00:07:20,948
"Jingle Bells"?

73
00:07:21,457 --> 00:07:23,186
Come on. Come on.

74
00:07:49,685 --> 00:07:51,550
You like that part, don't you?

75
00:08:08,171 --> 00:08:10,264
Why did you stop?

76
00:08:16,145 --> 00:08:18,943
A woman.
I saw a woman in the forest.

77
00:08:20,349 --> 00:08:22,442
-Cool. Dad is tripping out.
-Richard.

78
00:08:22,652 --> 00:08:24,882
-Are you sure, dad?
-Well, yeah.

79
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:28,488
Dressed in white.
She was holding something.

80
00:08:32,094 --> 00:08:33,823
Fuck!

81
00:08:35,264 --> 00:08:37,095
Hi there.

82
00:08:38,134 --> 00:08:40,432
We are a little lost.

83
00:08:40,670 --> 00:08:43,696
You wouldn't happen to know the
quickest way back to the highway?

84
00:08:45,541 --> 00:08:47,702
Are you all right?

85
00:08:48,477 --> 00:08:50,843
Did you have
an accident or something?

86
00:08:51,614 --> 00:08:54,208
Okay. Anybody got a cell phone?

87
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:00,621
-No signal.
-We just passed the cabin.

88
00:09:00,823 --> 00:09:04,589
Maybe there's a phone. Richard, be
a gentleman and make room for her.

89
00:09:04,794 --> 00:09:07,558
-Let Brad be the gentleman.
-What's your problem, man?

90
00:09:07,763 --> 00:09:09,560
Relax, buddy.

91
00:09:09,765 --> 00:09:13,257
Breath in slowly through your nose
and out deeply through your ass!

92
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:17,366
-It's all right, Mrs. Harrington.
-I'll walk.

93
00:09:17,773 --> 00:09:21,140
-I could use the fresh air, anyway.
-You're not walking by yourself.

94
00:09:21,344 --> 00:09:23,005
-I wanna be alone.
-Marion!

95
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:27,042
-Let me tell you something, smart guy.
-What?

96
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:29,844
Keep busting my balls and I'll
take you out of the game for good.

97
00:09:30,052 --> 00:09:32,919
-Understand me?
-Yes, sir!

98
00:09:33,122 --> 00:09:34,885
We'll meet you down there in
just a minute. Okay, honey?

99
00:09:35,791 --> 00:09:37,452
Okay.

100
00:09:38,794 --> 00:09:40,728
All right.

101
00:09:49,372 --> 00:09:52,466
Okay, we'll see you there, honey.

102
00:10:10,026 --> 00:10:11,891
Shit!

103
00:10:24,407 --> 00:10:27,240
Would you like a nice
hot cup of coffee?

104
00:10:34,283 --> 00:10:37,480
I think she's in shock. We should
have asked Marion what to do.

105
00:10:37,687 --> 00:10:41,350
Honey, we don't need a shrink.
We'll call 91 1.

106
00:10:41,557 --> 00:10:44,458
-Okay.
-They'll know how to handle it.

107
00:10:46,529 --> 00:10:49,555
Damn! Fucking stinks in here.

108
00:10:50,666 --> 00:10:52,998
It's the baby...

109
00:10:53,202 --> 00:10:55,500
jack-ass.

110
00:11:12,555 --> 00:11:15,524
-Where are you going, sweetie?
-Away from you guys.

111
00:11:17,593 --> 00:11:19,458
Teenagers.

112
00:11:20,596 --> 00:11:23,190
What's your name?

113
00:11:23,532 --> 00:11:25,864
Where do you live?

114
00:11:27,737 --> 00:11:31,036
-She's not gonna be much help.
-No.

115
00:12:08,444 --> 00:12:10,309
Hello, Miss July.

116
00:12:19,255 --> 00:12:20,722
Does anybody live here?

117
00:12:20,923 --> 00:12:24,222
Maybe it's one of those old
forest ranger stations.

118
00:12:36,906 --> 00:12:39,773
Jesus, Laura.
You scared the shit out of me.

119
00:12:39,975 --> 00:12:45,174
Sorry. They have very interesting
wall hangings, these rangers.

120
00:12:53,122 --> 00:12:55,022
So, what's his name?

121
00:12:59,495 --> 00:13:01,224
Do it, baby.

122
00:13:10,105 --> 00:13:12,198
You got a ring. You married?

123
00:13:15,177 --> 00:13:18,169
Marion and I are getting married.

124
00:13:19,582 --> 00:13:21,675
Actually...

125
00:13:22,418 --> 00:13:27,515
don't say anything but I'm proposing
to her tonight at her grandmother's.

126
00:13:27,756 --> 00:13:32,750
Remember when you said you would
kill yourself if I ever left you?

127
00:13:33,963 --> 00:13:37,490
I hope that was just
a figure of speech, 'cause...

128
00:13:42,438 --> 00:13:46,807
Brad, we've had some
great times together, but...

129
00:13:47,009 --> 00:13:51,469
I think we need to go on
with our lives separately.

130
00:13:51,847 --> 00:13:53,644
Shit.

131
00:13:59,755 --> 00:14:02,349
-Damn!
-Was there no dial tone?

132
00:14:02,558 --> 00:14:05,322
Nao, Laura, I just forgot
the number for 91 1.

133
00:14:09,064 --> 00:14:10,463
It's Amy.

134
00:14:13,802 --> 00:14:16,828
My little girl.
Her name is Amy.

135
00:14:20,609 --> 00:14:24,670
-She's so cold.
-Not surprised. It's freezing here.

136
00:14:27,116 --> 00:14:30,483
-You hold her.
-No.

137
00:14:31,987 --> 00:14:34,387
I'm not really a baby kind of guy.

138
00:14:40,362 --> 00:14:42,990
How does she breathe with
all those blanket on her face?

139
00:14:43,198 --> 00:14:44,961
Don't worry.

140
00:14:45,401 --> 00:14:47,699
She's dead.

141
00:14:50,472 --> 00:14:52,599
That's a good one.

142
00:14:57,913 --> 00:14:58,902
Oh, my God!

143
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:04,779
Shit!

144
00:15:04,987 --> 00:15:06,614
-What the hell was that?
-Richard!

145
00:15:06,989 --> 00:15:07,978
Richard!

146
00:15:08,424 --> 00:15:10,585
-Yeah, I'm here!
-Get over here.

147
00:15:15,164 --> 00:15:17,223
Where's Brad and the lady?

148
00:15:18,801 --> 00:15:20,098
-Brad!
-Are you okay?

149
00:15:20,302 --> 00:15:22,770
-Yeah, I'm fine. What's going on?
-Brad!

150
00:15:22,972 --> 00:15:24,530
Hey, dickhead!

151
00:15:48,931 --> 00:15:51,263
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

152
00:15:54,937 --> 00:15:57,167
-Dad?
-What?

153
00:15:57,373 --> 00:15:59,170
-They got Brad.
-What are you talking about?

154
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:01,343
-I saw Brad in a car! We gotta go.
-What car?

155
00:16:01,543 --> 00:16:03,272
We've gotta go!

156
00:16:05,414 --> 00:16:07,314
Frank, slow down.
You are gonna kill us all.

157
00:16:07,516 --> 00:16:10,383
You saw a car driving by
and Brad was in the back of it?

158
00:16:10,586 --> 00:16:12,178
-Yes.
-I don't get that! Why...

159
00:16:12,388 --> 00:16:16,381
I saw him. They were hurting him.
You have to stop them!

160
00:16:16,592 --> 00:16:19,527
-Okay! Where the hell did they go?
-Maybe they took a side road.

161
00:16:19,728 --> 00:16:21,719
Did you see one?
Me neither.

162
00:16:23,932 --> 00:16:26,696
-At least you don't drive like a pussy.
-Shut up, asshole!

163
00:16:36,945 --> 00:16:38,344
-What's going on?
-Why did you stop?

164
00:16:38,547 --> 00:16:40,708
Laura, give me the flashlight, please.

165
00:16:46,188 --> 00:16:47,780
Where's he going?

166
00:16:49,058 --> 00:16:52,323
-Why did he stop?
-Just a minute.

167
00:17:03,639 --> 00:17:05,937
Stay back. Stay back!

168
00:17:06,442 --> 00:17:08,603
Don't come over here,
for God's sake.

169
00:17:12,981 --> 00:17:15,609
-Fuck me!
-Oh, God!

170
00:17:17,252 --> 00:17:19,447
Richard, get your sister
back in the car now.

171
00:17:19,655 --> 00:17:22,556
My baby.
Do you have her?

172
00:17:28,697 --> 00:17:30,892
Jesus Christ...

173
00:17:49,351 --> 00:17:51,444
What is he doing?

174
00:17:51,653 --> 00:17:54,178
He's trying to get Brad's phone.

175
00:17:55,090 --> 00:17:58,526
-With a stick?
-You got a better idea?

176
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:04,891
I can't believe I'm gonna do this.
Look out.

177
00:18:23,385 --> 00:18:25,250
Oh, God...

178
00:18:29,591 --> 00:18:31,559
Good boy, Richard.

179
00:18:48,677 --> 00:18:50,736
Give it to me.

180
00:18:50,946 --> 00:18:53,813
And drop that.
That thing is dirty.

181
00:18:56,618 --> 00:18:58,279
You got a signal?

182
00:18:59,555 --> 00:19:02,991
Thank God. We can call the police
and they will tell us what to do.

183
00:19:03,192 --> 00:19:04,181
-Okay.
-Now.

184
00:19:04,393 --> 00:19:06,486
-Now.
-Now.

185
00:19:12,301 --> 00:19:16,863
Please, somebody help me.
Please!

186
00:19:18,307 --> 00:19:20,741
God! I can't feel my legs.

187
00:19:23,011 --> 00:19:25,605
I can't feel my legs!

188
00:19:26,682 --> 00:19:30,413
-Help me! My baby is bleeding!
-Who is this?

189
00:19:30,619 --> 00:19:32,143
Baby! Wake up!

190
00:19:36,291 --> 00:19:38,657
-Anybody, please help us.
-Oh, Jesus!

191
00:19:38,861 --> 00:19:41,159
Somebody, please, help us.

192
00:19:44,166 --> 00:19:47,693
Frank, we gotta get out of here.

193
00:19:47,903 --> 00:19:50,531
-Did you get the police?
-The phone, it was broken.

194
00:19:50,739 --> 00:19:53,367
-Shit.
-Please, let's go.

195
00:19:54,643 --> 00:19:57,203
We can't leave him here like this.

196
00:19:58,714 --> 00:20:02,480
Richard, drag his body off
to the side of the road.

197
00:20:02,784 --> 00:20:05,150
Jesus, what do I look like?
Your fucking janitor?

198
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:13,992
Thank God. Oh, Marion.

199
00:20:17,866 --> 00:20:21,131
Are you all right?
You're gonna be okay.

200
00:20:21,336 --> 00:20:23,167
Marion. Marion?

201
00:20:23,705 --> 00:20:26,503
Marion? Wake up.

202
00:20:27,309 --> 00:20:29,869
Wake up. Come on, wake up.
Wake up! Wake up!

203
00:20:30,078 --> 00:20:32,512
Laura! Stop!

204
00:20:33,081 --> 00:20:34,878
Stop it!

205
00:20:35,083 --> 00:20:36,880
Can't you see she's in shock?

206
00:20:37,085 --> 00:20:41,351
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

207
00:20:47,996 --> 00:20:51,397
Dad, that guy...

208
00:20:52,567 --> 00:20:54,592
or whoever did that...

209
00:20:54,870 --> 00:20:59,364
...must've used an axe or a chainsaw.
-lt was the work of one sick psycho.

210
00:20:59,574 --> 00:21:01,735
-Let's get the hell out of here.
-Wait. What about that woman?

211
00:21:01,944 --> 00:21:03,878
Maybe she got away.

212
00:21:04,379 --> 00:21:08,315
-Maybe the psycho got her.
-So, you wanna go after him?

213
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:14,321
Richard, get in.
We're going to the police.

214
00:21:15,991 --> 00:21:20,394
-Why don't we go back to lnterstate?
-Your mother lives by the sheriff's.

215
00:21:20,662 --> 00:21:22,857
We'll be there in 1 5 minutes.

216
00:21:27,903 --> 00:21:31,066
Marcott? Never heard of it.

217
00:21:31,273 --> 00:21:33,241
Richard, check the map.

218
00:21:35,677 --> 00:21:37,542
Marcott...

219
00:21:39,147 --> 00:21:41,012
Gimme a second.

220
00:21:43,452 --> 00:21:47,115
-There's no Marcott on this map.
-Just give it to me.

221
00:21:53,962 --> 00:21:58,626
-I don't see it either.
-Maybe that's because it's not there!

222
00:22:01,370 --> 00:22:04,601
-Laura, give me the local map.
-I didn't bring it.

223
00:22:05,507 --> 00:22:07,975
-You didn't bring it?
-We never needed it before.

224
00:22:08,176 --> 00:22:11,339
-I asked you to. Remember?
-I had a lot of things to take care of.

225
00:22:11,546 --> 00:22:14,310
-The presents and...
-Who gives a fuck about presents?

226
00:22:14,516 --> 00:22:17,110
Would you please
watch your language?

227
00:22:17,319 --> 00:22:22,655
I'm sorry, but how was I supposed to
know you're gonna take a shortcut?

228
00:22:22,858 --> 00:22:25,292
And how was I supposed to know that
you were going to forget the map?

229
00:22:25,494 --> 00:22:30,363
We've been coming here for 20 years,
and you'd never taken a shortcut.

230
00:22:31,099 --> 00:22:35,695
I'll bring a globe in case you feel
like driving by way of the North Pole!

231
00:22:44,413 --> 00:22:46,881
Is there any coffee left?

232
00:22:50,185 --> 00:22:52,176
A little.

233
00:22:52,821 --> 00:22:56,518
Okay. Pour me some.
Let's go to Marcott, then.

234
00:23:22,484 --> 00:23:27,114
Is anybody else a bit freaked out
we are the only car in the road now?

235
00:23:29,091 --> 00:23:31,559
It's Christmas Eve.

236
00:23:32,594 --> 00:23:37,429
Yeah. Okay. How long
have we been driving?

237
00:23:38,667 --> 00:23:40,362
It's 7:30.

238
00:23:40,569 --> 00:23:43,868
You said it was 7:30
when we took that lady into the car.

239
00:23:47,609 --> 00:23:49,372
That damn thing is broken.
All right. Who's got a watch?

240
00:23:49,578 --> 00:23:53,344
-I have a watch. It stopped at 7:30.
-Come on.

241
00:23:53,548 --> 00:23:58,144
Don't you guys think that
this is just a little wacked?

242
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:02,922
I know you guys think
I'm retarded or whatever...

243
00:24:03,125 --> 00:24:06,891
but I have a theory and I want you
to hear me out, okay?

244
00:24:07,896 --> 00:24:14,392
Brad is dead. His body is mutilated
and God knows how it got that way.

245
00:24:15,337 --> 00:24:20,138
We are the only people out here and
all the clocks have stopped at 7:30.

246
00:24:20,976 --> 00:24:23,570
This reeks of
alien activity, you guys.

247
00:24:28,683 --> 00:24:30,241
-Blow me.
-What?

248
00:24:30,452 --> 00:24:32,420
Nothing.

249
00:25:10,992 --> 00:25:12,721
Laura...

250
00:25:13,929 --> 00:25:16,022
can you make her stop that, please?

251
00:25:16,231 --> 00:25:20,930
-Let her. Maybe it will help.
-It's getting on my nerves.

252
00:25:52,867 --> 00:25:55,392
I can't believe I fell asleep.

253
00:25:56,071 --> 00:25:59,905
-How long was I out?
-I don't know. Maybe 1 0 minutes.

254
00:26:00,609 --> 00:26:02,736
Are we still on that same road?

255
00:26:04,813 --> 00:26:09,113
-Still no Marcott?
-No. No Marcott.

256
00:26:10,318 --> 00:26:13,253
-I don't understand. Did we pass it?
-No, I haven't seen anything.

257
00:26:13,455 --> 00:26:15,923
No lights, no signs, no nothing.

258
00:26:21,630 --> 00:26:24,827
Shit! What is that?

259
00:26:25,033 --> 00:26:27,763
-It's a baby carriage.
-I can see it's a baby carriage.

260
00:26:28,637 --> 00:26:32,095
-Okay. I'll get out and I'll go see.
-No. Don't.

261
00:26:32,307 --> 00:26:35,208
-Why?
-Just get going. I don't like this.

262
00:26:35,410 --> 00:26:39,642
-Richard, come back here! Richard!
-Stop yelling in my ear!

263
00:26:39,848 --> 00:26:41,975
Richard, come back here!

264
00:26:43,084 --> 00:26:45,075
Hey, little guy!

265
00:26:47,289 --> 00:26:51,089
Richard! Frank, no!

266
00:26:53,328 --> 00:26:56,422
-You guys suck!
-I'm gonna kill that kid.

267
00:26:56,631 --> 00:26:58,360
Oh, God!

268
00:26:58,566 --> 00:27:00,193
-What the hell was that?
-Man, that was good!

269
00:27:00,402 --> 00:27:04,304
-This is so not funny, Richard!
-It's a baby carriage. Why fear?

270
00:27:04,506 --> 00:27:06,565
-It's empty.
-No shit!

271
00:27:06,775 --> 00:27:10,871
-That is so not funny!
-Nice job. That was dumb.

272
00:27:23,725 --> 00:27:25,488
What is it now?

273
00:27:25,694 --> 00:27:30,563
I can't stop thinking about Diane.
How are we gonna tell her about Brad?

274
00:27:30,765 --> 00:27:33,996
-He was our responsibility.
-I don't wanna worry about that now!

275
00:27:35,003 --> 00:27:38,871
I just wanna figure out some
goddamn way to get out of here.

276
00:27:41,810 --> 00:27:43,744
I'm sorry.

277
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:47,671
Talk about a merry
fucking Christmas.

278
00:27:56,191 --> 00:27:58,591
You are not gonna open that.
That's my Uncle Herb's present.

279
00:27:58,793 --> 00:28:02,559
I need this a whole hell of a lot more
than your Uncle Herb right now.

280
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:15,268
Let's face it. We are lost, Frank.
This road is not going to Mom's.

281
00:28:16,378 --> 00:28:18,812
Let's turn around.
We should turn around, Frank.

282
00:28:19,013 --> 00:28:23,313
We just passed a sign.
Marcott can't be too far.

283
00:28:23,952 --> 00:28:25,180
Hey, Sis.

284
00:28:37,632 --> 00:28:42,194
Mom... Mom and Dad are kinda
going off the deep end, huh?

285
00:28:44,439 --> 00:28:48,102
They are really losing it.

286
00:28:51,579 --> 00:28:55,174
This whole thing is
pretty fucking crazy, huh?

287
00:28:57,218 --> 00:28:58,776
Mare?

288
00:28:59,587 --> 00:29:01,282
Mare?

289
00:29:09,397 --> 00:29:14,266
Come on, you've gotta snap
out of it, okay? You have to.

290
00:29:14,469 --> 00:29:16,733
We need you back here.

291
00:29:21,376 --> 00:29:24,209
I... I need you.

292
00:29:24,979 --> 00:29:29,814
Mom is always going on about
what a great shrink you are, so...

293
00:29:30,018 --> 00:29:35,149
you are the only person that can
figure a way out of this. Damn it!

294
00:29:46,134 --> 00:29:49,763
Do you remember when
your hamster disappeared...

295
00:29:49,971 --> 00:29:52,633
and I told you it had been
abducted by aliens?

296
00:29:53,908 --> 00:29:57,071
Well, I lied. Okay?
It was me.

297
00:29:57,278 --> 00:30:01,078
Me and Kevin. We stuck it
in the microwave and we fried it.

298
00:30:02,116 --> 00:30:03,845
Marion?

299
00:30:19,601 --> 00:30:21,159
Dad!

300
00:30:25,173 --> 00:30:27,698
Dad, it's here again.

301
00:30:30,945 --> 00:30:34,904
Richard, I am fed up
with your stupid jokes.

302
00:30:35,116 --> 00:30:38,552
-lt wasn't me this time. I swear.
-Richard, we do not have time...

303
00:30:38,753 --> 00:30:42,382
Christ! I'm telling you the truth,
your fucking assholes!

304
00:30:42,690 --> 00:30:45,284
Frank, would you say something
for once?

305
00:30:47,061 --> 00:30:50,724
-I think we'd better get out of here.
-Get going.

306
00:31:21,029 --> 00:31:25,728
We should have passed
a town or a gas station or...

307
00:31:25,934 --> 00:31:29,700
a motel, or a crossroads,
a junction, something by now!

308
00:31:29,904 --> 00:31:32,031
I know. I know.
Just calm down, Laura.

309
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:36,472
It's probably one of those closed
roads that forest rangers use.

310
00:31:36,678 --> 00:31:39,374
God! I just feel like
we've been driving forever.

311
00:31:39,981 --> 00:31:42,449
What is this forest?
Is this like the Amazon?

312
00:31:42,650 --> 00:31:46,552
Last year, I had to drive to Lakewood
to talk with a client and I went...

313
00:31:46,754 --> 00:31:50,246
...on a very roundabout way.
-What you seem to do sometimes.

314
00:31:50,458 --> 00:31:54,519
I was driving and driving until I had
to turn back to the road I came from.

315
00:31:54,729 --> 00:31:57,323
-What are you talking about?
-Some of these roads are designed...

316
00:31:57,532 --> 00:32:00,831
by engineers who weren't qualified
to build a goddamn bird house!

317
00:32:01,035 --> 00:32:03,731
-So?
-So? That's that!

318
00:32:06,074 --> 00:32:07,974
That's that...

319
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:12,673
Lakewood? Isn't there where
Sally Schmidt bought her cottage?

320
00:32:13,214 --> 00:32:14,909
Yeah, I think so.

321
00:32:21,489 --> 00:32:23,787
Jesus Christ!

322
00:32:24,626 --> 00:32:27,686
-What was that?
-Some kind of a radio talk show.

323
00:32:27,895 --> 00:32:30,864
-That was no talk show.
-A public radio, or something.

324
00:32:31,065 --> 00:32:33,090
Public radio? Right.

325
00:32:33,301 --> 00:32:36,600
-No! Damn it!
-You just said it was public radio!

326
00:32:36,804 --> 00:32:38,772
I don't know what it was!
I don't wanna know what it was!

327
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:42,109
I just wanna get to the police
before anything else goes wrong.

328
00:32:42,744 --> 00:32:44,803
And I thought last year's
Christmas was bad.

329
00:32:45,279 --> 00:32:46,644
And what was wrong with
last year's Christmas?

330
00:32:46,948 --> 00:32:51,214
-Let's see... Everything?
-I thought last year was great!

331
00:32:51,452 --> 00:32:55,889
-We took the lnterstate!
-I was talking about Christmas dinner.

332
00:32:56,090 --> 00:32:57,990
And what's wrong with my
family's Christmas dinners?

333
00:32:58,192 --> 00:32:59,716
Your family.

334
00:33:02,030 --> 00:33:04,692
Your mother always felt you deserved
more than a used car salesman.

335
00:33:05,099 --> 00:33:07,829
Now that salesman has become
a respected sales manager.

336
00:33:08,036 --> 00:33:10,504
So, I'm sorry, baby,
but screw your mother!

337
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:16,542
-Anything else?
-Your damn brother is a freak too!

338
00:33:16,744 --> 00:33:18,211
He jerks off to gun magazines!

339
00:33:18,413 --> 00:33:22,213
That is disgusting! That is
disgusting and that is not fair!

340
00:33:22,617 --> 00:33:26,451
-Mikey has had a lot of hard times!
-Poor little Mikey! Poor Mikey!

341
00:33:26,654 --> 00:33:29,054
Wht do I have to suffer every time
I talk to the son of a bitch?

342
00:33:29,257 --> 00:33:31,384
-You are just so sensitive!
-I know it's Christmas, Laura.

343
00:33:31,592 --> 00:33:36,154
I know it's the season of giving,
but I don't give a shit right now!

344
00:33:36,364 --> 00:33:38,628
I just wanna get
off this goddamn road!

345
00:33:42,437 --> 00:33:45,429
-Jesus! Mother of..! Fuck!
-Oh, Frank!

346
00:33:46,274 --> 00:33:49,505
It's okay, honey.
We just had a blow-out.

347
00:33:50,278 --> 00:33:52,769
-Okay.
-I'm pregnant.

348
00:33:54,449 --> 00:33:56,041
Marion!

349
00:33:58,519 --> 00:34:00,214
Jesus Christ!

350
00:34:01,389 --> 00:34:03,687
I smoke pot.

351
00:34:06,127 --> 00:34:08,095
I'm gonna go change the tire.

352
00:34:16,704 --> 00:34:18,433
You handle that wrench
like a whore handles a baby.

353
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:22,234
-Fucking do it yourself, man.
-You watch your mouth, goddamn it.

354
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:28,610
-All right.
-You want some help?

355
00:34:29,550 --> 00:34:31,484
How is Marion doing?

356
00:34:32,019 --> 00:34:34,146
She's pregnant.

357
00:34:35,723 --> 00:34:40,183
-How are you?
-Frankly, it's been much for one night.

358
00:34:40,862 --> 00:34:42,693
I'll say.

359
00:34:44,332 --> 00:34:47,495
-Where did Richard go?
-He's probably off smoking a joint.

360
00:34:47,702 --> 00:34:50,762
That is not funny!
Our son is doing drugs!

361
00:34:50,972 --> 00:34:52,303
Please, Laura.

362
00:34:52,507 --> 00:34:57,308
-Can't you see this is a cry for help?
-Christ! It's just a joint, all right?

363
00:34:58,179 --> 00:35:01,580
-Not worse than those pills you take.
-My pills are legal!

364
00:35:28,209 --> 00:35:31,076
Pregnant.

365
00:35:32,513 --> 00:35:37,576
Man, I hope it's a boy.
What's up, little critter?

366
00:35:38,119 --> 00:35:39,882
I'm your Uncle Dick.

367
00:35:43,391 --> 00:35:46,792
That means you'd better
show me some respect, huh?

368
00:35:46,994 --> 00:35:50,088
Or I will fuck you up.

369
00:35:54,702 --> 00:35:56,533
Okay.

370
00:35:56,971 --> 00:35:59,565
Are you okay, honey-bunny?

371
00:36:01,442 --> 00:36:05,378
-Don't you ever call me that again.
-Okay.

372
00:36:06,113 --> 00:36:10,550
-Okay, that's fine.
-That's what Brad called me.

373
00:36:13,020 --> 00:36:15,955
Uncle Dick. Right on.

374
00:36:32,473 --> 00:36:34,498
Fuck!

375
00:37:02,069 --> 00:37:04,401
I love you.

376
00:37:06,974 --> 00:37:08,202
Jesus!

377
00:37:09,010 --> 00:37:11,638
Okay. I'm done. Let's go.

378
00:37:11,846 --> 00:37:13,973
Richard, we're going!

379
00:37:17,585 --> 00:37:20,053
-It's the car!
-Oh, my God...

380
00:37:30,831 --> 00:37:32,526
Open the door!

381
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:36,367
-Open the door! Open the door!
-Laura! Laura!

382
00:37:37,204 --> 00:37:39,331
Let's go back and get the car!

383
00:37:47,715 --> 00:37:49,342
Dad! Dad!

384
00:37:50,985 --> 00:37:55,012
Richard! Richard!

385
00:37:55,656 --> 00:37:59,990
Come here!
Laura, get in the car now!

386
00:38:00,528 --> 00:38:04,362
-Frank...
-Get in, we'll get him!

387
00:38:07,902 --> 00:38:10,132
-Faster!
-lt doesn't go any faster, Laura!

388
00:38:10,338 --> 00:38:12,169
-Where is he?
-I don't know. I can't see him.

389
00:38:12,373 --> 00:38:14,705
The son of a bitch
shut off his lights!

390
00:38:15,009 --> 00:38:16,374
-They are gonna kill him.
-No!

391
00:38:16,577 --> 00:38:17,566
-They are gonna kill him!
-No, they won't!

392
00:38:17,778 --> 00:38:19,211
-Yes, they are!
-Calm down, mom!

393
00:38:19,413 --> 00:38:22,075
He'll be all right!
I'll get him!

394
00:38:26,387 --> 00:38:29,379
-lt was Richard!
-Shut up! Damn it!

395
00:38:29,590 --> 00:38:31,990
It was Richard!

396
00:38:34,061 --> 00:38:37,553
Stop the car! Stop the car!

397
00:38:39,633 --> 00:38:42,033
Please...

398
00:38:42,603 --> 00:38:44,503
My baby!

399
00:38:47,274 --> 00:38:50,072
Please...
What did they do to you?

400
00:38:50,277 --> 00:38:51,676
-Mom...
-Come on.

401
00:38:51,879 --> 00:38:55,178
Come on, baby. You can wake up.
Come one, baby.

402
00:38:55,383 --> 00:38:56,748
Laura...

403
00:38:56,951 --> 00:38:58,919
-Laura...
-What? What?

404
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:02,783
-Mom, he is...
-No! No, no...

405
00:39:04,558 --> 00:39:09,427
This is one of his jokes, isn't it?
You're just like your father.

406
00:39:09,630 --> 00:39:12,827
Remember the time that
he took me to New Orleans?

407
00:39:13,034 --> 00:39:17,437
-We never went to New Orleans.
-'Course not. You're not his father.

408
00:39:18,839 --> 00:39:22,400
-What?
-Richard is not your son.

409
00:39:23,210 --> 00:39:26,338
-Mom, what are you talking about?
-She's out of her fucking mind.

410
00:39:26,547 --> 00:39:31,314
I am not out of my mind.
Don't you remember Alan Rickson?

411
00:39:31,519 --> 00:39:34,545
-Laura...
-What? What?

412
00:39:34,755 --> 00:39:38,589
-What did you say?
-You remember Alan Rickson?

413
00:39:38,793 --> 00:39:42,160
My baby. I don't wanna go.
I don't wanna go.

414
00:39:42,363 --> 00:39:45,355
-Please, let me stay with him.
-Come on.

415
00:39:45,566 --> 00:39:48,262
Let me stay...

416
00:39:49,370 --> 00:39:55,536
Don't take me from him! Oh, God!
Please, I don't wanna go.

417
00:39:55,743 --> 00:39:58,109
Please, Frank...

418
00:40:41,255 --> 00:40:45,385
-What are we gonna do?
-We gotta go to the police.

419
00:40:47,561 --> 00:40:51,930
How are we gonna go to the police?
We're in the middle of nowhere.

420
00:40:52,867 --> 00:40:56,667
-Come on. Let's go, honey.
-We can't leave him here.

421
00:40:56,871 --> 00:41:00,102
No, we won't.

422
00:41:00,307 --> 00:41:03,799
He was my son.
He goes with us.

423
00:41:16,857 --> 00:41:18,848
What is it?

424
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:22,991
It's what Uncle Mike
wanted for Christmas.

425
00:41:25,332 --> 00:41:27,926
Thank God for the gun freak.

426
00:41:42,683 --> 00:41:44,913
Isn't Michael coming?

427
00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:47,314
-Michael? Who the hell is Michael?
-It's Richard.

428
00:41:48,055 --> 00:41:52,321
His real name is Michael. Because
that is what Alan wanted to call him.

429
00:41:52,660 --> 00:41:56,926
-Richard is dead!
-Okay.

430
00:41:57,898 --> 00:41:59,525
Would you like some pie?

431
00:42:05,773 --> 00:42:08,867
-lt was that sign again.
-How far is this fucking town?

432
00:42:09,076 --> 00:42:13,342
-We've been driving for 1 00 miles.
-What a wonderful Christmas.

433
00:42:14,448 --> 00:42:17,246
I wonder if I should save
some pie for Michael?

434
00:42:19,086 --> 00:42:22,078
-Do you think she's gonna recover?
-I don't know.

435
00:42:22,289 --> 00:42:25,224
But she's gonna have to
face reality sooner or later.

436
00:42:25,426 --> 00:42:27,792
-What a wonderful Chrismtas.
-God only knows how she will react.

437
00:42:27,995 --> 00:42:31,487
-Can't be any worse.
-lt can be much worse.

438
00:42:32,366 --> 00:42:35,096
Look, I finished the pie.

439
00:42:37,004 --> 00:42:39,564
-Could I have a pen, please?
-What for?

440
00:42:40,674 --> 00:42:44,906
-I'm gonna do a drawing.
-Good, good. Here, my pen.

441
00:42:45,379 --> 00:42:48,542
-You are so beautiful, Marion.
-Jesus!

442
00:42:51,151 --> 00:42:54,279
Let's hope there's
a hospital in Marcott.

443
00:42:54,488 --> 00:42:59,653
What if we never reach Marcott?
What if she gets us first?

444
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:03,061
-Who?
-The lady in white.

445
00:43:03,864 --> 00:43:06,128
-That woman with the baby?
-Yeah, I saw her in the woods...

446
00:43:06,333 --> 00:43:08,164
...right after Richard disappeared.
-You saw her?

447
00:43:08,369 --> 00:43:12,271
And then I remembered the story
my grandfather used to tell me.

448
00:43:12,873 --> 00:43:15,137
Used to creep me out
every time I heard it.

449
00:43:15,342 --> 00:43:20,405
Look. I made a drawing of Brad. This
was his leg that was hanging out.

450
00:43:20,848 --> 00:43:23,078
-It's for you.
-Okay, Mom.

451
00:43:23,817 --> 00:43:25,375
Wipe your face.

452
00:43:25,586 --> 00:43:30,819
There was this couple that was
driving home from a wedding...

453
00:43:31,025 --> 00:43:33,789
in Rhode lsland.
It was night. It was raining.

454
00:43:33,994 --> 00:43:37,191
And they saw a little girl
standing by the side of the road.

455
00:43:37,765 --> 00:43:40,825
And she was just wandering back
and forth, clutching the school book.

456
00:43:41,035 --> 00:43:45,131
They stopped and they let her
get into the back seat...

457
00:43:45,339 --> 00:43:49,241
and they tried to talk to her,
but she must have been in shock.

458
00:43:49,443 --> 00:43:52,879
They were driving on down the road,
all of a sudden they heard a scream...

459
00:43:53,080 --> 00:43:55,480
coming from the back seat.

460
00:43:55,683 --> 00:43:58,174
They slammed on the brakes,
they nearly had an accident.

461
00:43:58,385 --> 00:44:02,446
Miraculously, they didn't go over the
cliff. They turned to the back seat...

462
00:44:02,656 --> 00:44:05,181
the little girl had vanished.

463
00:44:05,392 --> 00:44:08,691
There was just her school book
there, with her name on it.

464
00:44:09,596 --> 00:44:11,723
Barbara Rose.

465
00:44:12,299 --> 00:44:14,460
And then they remembered:

466
00:44:15,102 --> 00:44:19,004
the entire Rose family had died
in a tragic car accident...

467
00:44:19,206 --> 00:44:22,300
right at that cliff,
five years earlier.

468
00:44:27,014 --> 00:44:31,713
Come on! Dad, what are you saying?
That that woman is a ghost?

469
00:44:33,120 --> 00:44:36,180
Look! We've got potato chips!

470
00:44:36,657 --> 00:44:39,592
I'll get them open.
I didn't know we had them.

471
00:44:41,061 --> 00:44:43,928
-Do you want some?
-Mom, don't eat them so fast.

472
00:44:44,131 --> 00:44:46,656
-You're gonna make yourself sick.
-I am not.

473
00:44:48,736 --> 00:44:52,866
Oh, God! We'd better wake up
from this nightmare pretty soon.

474
00:44:57,244 --> 00:44:59,804
Do you feel better, Laura?

475
00:45:06,186 --> 00:45:08,677
Dad, who's Alan Rickson?

476
00:45:08,889 --> 00:45:11,221
I have no idea.

477
00:45:15,696 --> 00:45:18,790
-What was Mom talking about?
-I never heard of any Alan Rickson.

478
00:45:18,999 --> 00:45:22,628
She's in shock. She's talking
a whole lot of nonsense.

479
00:45:22,970 --> 00:45:25,632
-Why would she do that?
-You tell me.

480
00:45:25,839 --> 00:45:27,773
Wow! Look what I found!

481
00:45:29,143 --> 00:45:32,408
Mom, put the gun down.
It's dangerous.

482
00:45:32,613 --> 00:45:36,777
It's not. It's a toy! It's like
the one Michael used to have.

483
00:45:39,019 --> 00:45:41,419
-Laura!
-I was just kidding!

484
00:45:41,622 --> 00:45:45,456
Laura, that is a loaded gun.
Put it down.

485
00:45:47,828 --> 00:45:51,059
You are just trying to scare me.
I don't wanna play with you anymore.

486
00:45:51,265 --> 00:45:53,756
-Bang-bang, you are dead!
-Okay.

487
00:45:53,967 --> 00:45:57,095
Okay, sweetheart. You win.

488
00:45:57,671 --> 00:45:59,263
I'm dead.

489
00:46:00,374 --> 00:46:03,002
-Do something.
-Like what?

490
00:46:03,210 --> 00:46:05,508
-You are the shrink.
-Student shrink.

491
00:46:05,712 --> 00:46:08,340
-Marion...
-Mom!

492
00:46:08,749 --> 00:46:12,344
-Yes, darling.
-We'll play something else now.

493
00:46:13,086 --> 00:46:15,919
Remember when
we used to play house?

494
00:46:18,425 --> 00:46:21,292
I don't wanna play that. I wanna
play what Michael and I used to.

495
00:46:21,495 --> 00:46:25,056
Laura, this is not a game!
Our son is dead!

496
00:46:25,866 --> 00:46:30,200
-No.
-Richard is dead!

497
00:46:32,606 --> 00:46:34,335
Dad!

498
00:46:38,078 --> 00:46:41,809
Holy shit!
The bitch shot me in the leg!

499
00:46:42,950 --> 00:46:45,748
-ls he hurt?
-Mom, go back to the car.

500
00:46:45,953 --> 00:46:48,547
-It's gonna be all right.
-ls he gonna die too?

501
00:46:48,755 --> 00:46:51,815
Nobody is gonna die anymore, okay?

502
00:46:52,593 --> 00:46:54,993
How does it look, Doc?

503
00:46:55,395 --> 00:46:57,260
We'll see.

504
00:46:57,831 --> 00:47:01,164
-Hold this. Hold this!
-All right.

505
00:47:02,669 --> 00:47:05,763
-I have to get the pellets out.
-Okay.

506
00:47:06,206 --> 00:47:08,766
Light on the wound, please.

507
00:47:12,145 --> 00:47:15,740
-Have you done this before?
-No, this is my first time.

508
00:47:15,949 --> 00:47:18,611
-Shit!
-Light on the wound!

509
00:47:22,155 --> 00:47:24,350
Right.

510
00:47:24,958 --> 00:47:26,482
-Okay, brace yourself.
-Why?

511
00:47:26,693 --> 00:47:28,456
Brace yourself.

512
00:47:30,797 --> 00:47:32,958
Oh, God!

513
00:47:34,067 --> 00:47:37,059
That hurt more than the shot!

514
00:47:37,938 --> 00:47:40,406
Okay, lift your leg up.

515
00:47:43,243 --> 00:47:46,576
All right. All right.
You should be all right now.

516
00:47:51,084 --> 00:47:54,349
-Give me the keys.
-I'll drive.

517
00:47:56,456 --> 00:47:59,425
Easy on the bottle there.

518
00:48:02,262 --> 00:48:04,753
-You know of a better pain killer?
-Driving isn't helping any.

519
00:48:04,965 --> 00:48:06,432
It helps.

520
00:48:13,874 --> 00:48:15,899
I don't understand it.

521
00:48:16,109 --> 00:48:18,771
We should have passed
a side-road by now.

522
00:48:18,979 --> 00:48:22,346
Your grandma's place is
probably miles behind us.

523
00:48:27,521 --> 00:48:31,218
That's it!
This must be a military road!

524
00:48:31,558 --> 00:48:33,219
You think so?

525
00:48:33,427 --> 00:48:36,658
That's why we never see military
trucks. Always on roads isolated!

526
00:48:36,863 --> 00:48:40,390
Marcott must be a military base.
That's why it's not even on the map.

527
00:48:41,635 --> 00:48:45,901
-I guess so.
-Of course! That's it! That's it!

528
00:49:22,442 --> 00:49:23,807
Dad?

529
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:28,746
-Dad!
-It's okay, honey.

530
00:49:28,949 --> 00:49:32,077
-I'm here. I'm here.
-Thank God! I thought that...

531
00:49:33,587 --> 00:49:35,646
Your leg...

532
00:49:36,223 --> 00:49:38,214
-Are you okay?
-That's not so bad.

533
00:49:38,425 --> 00:49:41,223
I think we finally got some
good news. Come here.

534
00:49:42,162 --> 00:49:46,064
Look. Earlier, I showed
your mother the North Star.

535
00:49:46,667 --> 00:49:49,227
It was on our right side.
It still is.

536
00:49:49,436 --> 00:49:52,599
That means we've been
headed constantly west.

537
00:49:52,806 --> 00:49:56,799
So, if we left the lnterstate
somewhere around here...

538
00:49:57,010 --> 00:49:58,910
and we headed constantly
west on this road...

539
00:49:59,112 --> 00:50:01,171
the road must go right
straight to the sea.

540
00:50:01,381 --> 00:50:05,215
Marcott must be somewhere on
the coast. It makes perfect sense.

541
00:50:05,585 --> 00:50:07,314
It must be a naval base.

542
00:50:07,521 --> 00:50:11,116
Okay, okay. So how long
until we get there?

543
00:50:11,792 --> 00:50:16,320
We have about half a tank of gas,
we covered 1 50 miles on this road.

544
00:50:16,530 --> 00:50:21,263
That leaves us another 40 or 50
miles until we get to the coast.

545
00:50:21,568 --> 00:50:23,866
We can reach Marcott
within an hour, tops.

546
00:50:24,471 --> 00:50:26,029
You're a genius.

547
00:50:29,843 --> 00:50:33,301
But you know, I'm more than a little
concerned about your mother.

548
00:50:34,548 --> 00:50:35,981
-Mom?
-You're awake?

549
00:50:36,183 --> 00:50:40,643
-I slept like a log.
-How are you feeling?

550
00:50:41,288 --> 00:50:45,657
I feel... okay...
considering...

551
00:50:46,026 --> 00:50:48,790
Now we have got...

552
00:50:48,995 --> 00:50:54,023
to stick together. We have got to
support each other in our grief.

553
00:50:56,136 --> 00:50:58,696
Would you like me to drive, darling?

554
00:50:59,139 --> 00:51:03,371
-We should reach Marcott soon.
-Oh, good!

555
00:51:04,511 --> 00:51:07,571
-You look not very well.
-She's okay.

556
00:51:08,248 --> 00:51:14,744
Frank, you know,
you are a wonderful father.

557
00:51:16,289 --> 00:51:19,281
And a wonderful husband too.

558
00:51:19,993 --> 00:51:24,726
I want you to know that I understand
about you and Sally Schmidt.

559
00:51:26,566 --> 00:51:28,693
-What?
-I know the whole thing.

560
00:51:28,902 --> 00:51:33,805
I know how you two used to meet
at the Motel 6 on your lunch break.

561
00:51:34,975 --> 00:51:39,537
It's okay. I completely understand.
I have never been able to fulfill...

562
00:51:39,746 --> 00:51:42,806
your sexual fantasies.
And I want to promise you...

563
00:51:43,016 --> 00:51:47,419
that when we get out of here, you can
do anything you want to me, darling.

564
00:51:48,822 --> 00:51:51,552
And I mean anything.

565
00:51:53,460 --> 00:51:57,157
Anyway, the most important thing...

566
00:51:57,564 --> 00:52:01,193
is that the three of us come out
of this stronger. What do you think?

567
00:52:02,469 --> 00:52:05,563
-Not much.
-Good.

568
00:52:06,773 --> 00:52:08,638
Now...

569
00:52:09,409 --> 00:52:12,071
there's something that has been
bothering me ever since I woke up.

570
00:52:12,279 --> 00:52:15,612
-What?
-Who are these people in the woods?

571
00:52:19,019 --> 00:52:21,783
Honey, slow down. They are waving.

572
00:52:23,023 --> 00:52:25,082
Hi!

573
00:52:25,492 --> 00:52:28,723
Oh, my goodness,
why do they look so sad?

574
00:52:28,929 --> 00:52:31,022
This is Christmas Eve.

575
00:52:31,231 --> 00:52:32,960
Smile!

576
00:52:33,166 --> 00:52:36,067
They teach you what to do
in this kind of situation?

577
00:52:36,269 --> 00:52:38,669
Not to panic.

578
00:52:41,174 --> 00:52:44,769
Frank, do you really need to
suck on that bottle like that?

579
00:52:46,346 --> 00:52:49,713
Frank! It's Jeannine!
Quick, stop the car!

580
00:52:49,916 --> 00:52:51,816
-Who is Jeannine?
-She's my friend!

581
00:52:52,018 --> 00:52:53,883
Who died 20 years ago.

582
00:52:54,087 --> 00:52:56,954
-And what exactly is your point?
-She's dead.

583
00:52:57,157 --> 00:52:59,216
-So?
-So drop it!

584
00:52:59,426 --> 00:53:04,762
If the dead are alive, maybe
we should check out Richard.

585
00:53:04,965 --> 00:53:08,332
-Are you crazy?
-Think he is comfortable back there?

586
00:53:08,535 --> 00:53:11,766
Mom, if he was alive, don't
you think we would here him?

587
00:53:12,172 --> 00:53:14,072
Your brother was burned alive.
How could he talk?

588
00:53:14,274 --> 00:53:15,866
-Shut up, Laura!
-Easy, dad.

589
00:53:16,076 --> 00:53:17,976
-Okay.
-She's driving me crazy.

590
00:53:20,247 --> 00:53:22,909
-Could I go see Jeannine now?
-No, you can't!

591
00:53:24,050 --> 00:53:25,779
-Yes, I can.
-No, you can't!

592
00:53:26,186 --> 00:53:28,848
-Yes, I can.
-No, you...

593
00:53:29,623 --> 00:53:31,818
I'm gonna go now.

594
00:53:33,793 --> 00:53:36,990
Oh, my God! Dad, stop the car!

595
00:53:39,065 --> 00:53:42,398
-Mom!
-Laura! Laura!

596
00:53:42,869 --> 00:53:45,167
-Mom!
-Laura!

597
00:53:45,572 --> 00:53:47,335
Mom!

598
00:53:48,174 --> 00:53:50,768
Oh, God! God! Laura!

599
00:54:01,354 --> 00:54:04,881
-Where the hell did she go?
-Mom?

600
00:54:06,860 --> 00:54:08,851
Mom!

601
00:54:10,363 --> 00:54:12,228
-Maybe she ran away.
-Oh, Marion...

602
00:54:12,432 --> 00:54:15,799
-Maybe she went into the woods.
-Marion, I'm going 60!

603
00:54:16,002 --> 00:54:19,028
-She would have broken her neck!
-Then where is she?

604
00:54:19,239 --> 00:54:21,639
Maybe the lady got her.

605
00:54:24,644 --> 00:54:26,373
It's the black car.

606
00:54:26,579 --> 00:54:30,709
You son of a bitch. I'm gonna
blow that bastard's head off.

607
00:54:32,652 --> 00:54:37,453
-Marion, where's the ammo?
-It's here. I hid it from mom.

608
00:54:37,657 --> 00:54:39,488
Come on!

609
00:54:58,178 --> 00:55:00,408
I got him!

610
00:55:10,690 --> 00:55:12,988
-Mom!
-Laura.

611
00:55:13,193 --> 00:55:16,458
-Thank God.
-Mom, are you all right?

612
00:55:16,796 --> 00:55:20,197
I'm okay. My head hurts a little
but I'm fine.

613
00:55:20,533 --> 00:55:22,091
Sweetheart.

614
00:55:22,302 --> 00:55:25,567
Honey, honey.
You got something on your...

615
00:55:25,839 --> 00:55:28,501
Oh, my God! Oh, God!

616
00:55:28,708 --> 00:55:31,404
-Something wrong with my hair?
-Oh, God!

617
00:55:40,353 --> 00:55:42,082
Alan!

618
00:55:42,288 --> 00:55:43,846
-Finally!
-No! Stop!

619
00:55:44,057 --> 00:55:47,720
-Alan!
-Stop! Stop!

620
00:55:50,697 --> 00:55:52,528
Laura...

621
00:55:52,899 --> 00:55:54,526
-Daddy?
-Laura...

622
00:55:54,734 --> 00:55:58,033
I made the cheerleading squad.

623
00:55:59,072 --> 00:56:03,008
This is the happiest day
of my life.

624
00:56:16,156 --> 00:56:18,021
Laura...

625
00:56:44,417 --> 00:56:45,645
Dad! Dad!

626
00:56:45,852 --> 00:56:48,548
Give me that gun!
Stop it, dad! Stop it!

627
00:56:48,755 --> 00:56:51,223
-You bastard! Stop it!
-Marion...

628
00:56:51,424 --> 00:56:56,259
I'm gonna have a baby. You can't
leave us. You can't leave us.

629
00:56:56,463 --> 00:57:01,127
-I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
-I've already lost my mother...

630
00:57:01,334 --> 00:57:05,566
and my brother and my boyfriend.
I don't wanna lose you.

631
00:57:05,939 --> 00:57:10,535
-I don't wanna lose you.
-She's gonna get us all anyway.

632
00:57:10,743 --> 00:57:15,874
No. No one is gonna get us,
as long as we keep moving.

633
00:57:16,349 --> 00:57:20,786
Every time we've stopped, someone's
gotten killed. We have to keep driving.

634
00:57:21,287 --> 00:57:23,653
We are going to Marcott.

635
00:57:35,735 --> 00:57:37,726
Let's put your mother in the car.

636
00:57:51,684 --> 00:57:54,050
-You got a cigarette?
-ln my coat.

637
00:58:11,070 --> 00:58:15,336
Alan Rickson was a friend of mine,
back in Detroit.

638
00:58:16,509 --> 00:58:19,876
You don't have to say anything, Dad.

639
00:58:20,380 --> 00:58:24,874
Then one day he came to me
for some advice.

640
00:58:27,253 --> 00:58:30,780
He said that he was
in love with a woman.

641
00:58:31,858 --> 00:58:34,258
Didn't mention her name.

642
00:58:34,460 --> 00:58:38,794
He said that she was married
and that she loved him too.

643
00:58:40,366 --> 00:58:44,598
And he wanted to know
what he should do about it.

644
00:58:46,806 --> 00:58:50,003
And I remember what
I said to him...

645
00:58:51,010 --> 00:58:54,207
"You only live once, buddy.
Go for it.

646
00:58:54,414 --> 00:59:00,512
Just go. You go and you see her,
and if she loves you...

647
00:59:00,720 --> 00:59:03,848
she will leave her husband
and she will go with you."

648
00:59:06,092 --> 00:59:10,961
-I'm sorry, Dad.
-Only talked to him once after that.

649
00:59:11,965 --> 00:59:17,335
He said the woman had decided she
didn't want to leave her husband.

650
00:59:19,839 --> 00:59:22,808
She already had a kid.

651
00:59:24,510 --> 00:59:27,172
A little girl.

652
00:59:28,414 --> 00:59:32,180
She didn't want to lose her.

653
00:59:35,989 --> 00:59:39,686
Last time I ever saw Alan.

654
00:59:41,127 --> 00:59:44,995
Always wondered
why he never kept in touch.

655
00:59:54,707 --> 00:59:56,572
Why did you do that?

656
00:59:56,776 --> 00:59:59,267
If you are scared,
alcohol will only make it worse.

657
00:59:59,479 --> 01:00:03,643
-You think I'm scared?
-You don't need to pretend.

658
01:00:04,384 --> 01:00:07,319
-It's okay.
-No, it's not.

659
01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:10,546
Have you looked at
the odometer lately?

660
01:00:10,757 --> 01:00:13,658
We've driven 60 miles since
the last time we checked the map.

661
01:00:13,860 --> 01:00:15,350
I know.

662
01:00:15,561 --> 01:00:18,325
-We should have reached the coast.
-I know.

663
01:00:18,965 --> 01:00:21,490
Maybe I miscalculated a little bit.

664
01:00:21,701 --> 01:00:23,430
Maybe.

665
01:00:23,636 --> 01:00:25,866
Maybe the North Star
doesn't indicate north.

666
01:00:26,072 --> 01:00:29,473
Maybe the map maker was drunk.
Maybe the moon's made out of cheese.

667
01:00:29,676 --> 01:00:33,669
Who knows? Everything is so
fucked up on this goddamn road!

668
01:00:43,022 --> 01:00:47,482
After all, we don't have to drive
to get to Marcott.

669
01:00:47,694 --> 01:00:51,528
-Maybe there's another way out.
-Like what, dad? Flying?

670
01:00:51,864 --> 01:00:54,662
No. Walking.

671
01:00:58,204 --> 01:00:59,501
Through the woods.

672
01:00:59,706 --> 01:01:03,073
-This is insane.
-Agreed. Agreed.

673
01:01:03,576 --> 01:01:06,443
-You ready?
-We should at least wait until sunrise.

674
01:01:06,646 --> 01:01:10,275
Remember what you said? Every time
we stopped, somebody died.

675
01:01:10,483 --> 01:01:12,747
Let's keep moving.

676
01:01:33,072 --> 01:01:34,699
Did you hear that?

677
01:01:34,907 --> 01:01:37,205
-Of course I heard that.
-What is it?

678
01:01:37,410 --> 01:01:39,435
I don't know. We're in the woods,
Dad. It could be anything.

679
01:01:39,645 --> 01:01:42,045
A branch falling, a rat or something,
maybe a bird.

680
01:01:42,248 --> 01:01:47,413
Remember what Laura said
about all the faces in the forest?

681
01:01:49,722 --> 01:01:53,158
Are there any ghosts
in the woods tonight?

682
01:01:58,464 --> 01:02:01,092
-Come on, I'm waiting!
-Don't...

683
01:02:01,300 --> 01:02:05,532
ever, ever do that again.
You hear me?

684
01:02:07,340 --> 01:02:10,036
-What is the matter with you?
-We shouldn't have left the car.

685
01:02:10,243 --> 01:02:12,507
That's what's the matter with me!

686
01:02:12,712 --> 01:02:16,478
The more distance we put between us
and the road, the better off we'll be.

687
01:02:16,682 --> 01:02:19,207
Goddamn! Shit!

688
01:02:19,419 --> 01:02:20,886
Shit! Shit!

689
01:02:21,087 --> 01:02:23,578
-Are you all right?
-Yeah, just dandy.

690
01:02:23,790 --> 01:02:28,420
-What the hell is that?
-You found us a fence!

691
01:02:29,962 --> 01:02:33,591
A fence. Good, good.

692
01:02:34,534 --> 01:02:37,526
There must be a farm
on the other side. It's not that tight.

693
01:02:37,737 --> 01:02:40,831
I'll hold it up.
You crawl under. Go on.

694
01:02:41,574 --> 01:02:43,872
-Now you hold it for me.
-Okay.

695
01:02:52,885 --> 01:02:54,853
Dad! Look!

696
01:02:56,489 --> 01:02:58,047
-Hello!
-Hello!

697
01:02:58,257 --> 01:02:59,315
Hello!

698
01:02:59,525 --> 01:03:01,993
We're here! We're here!

699
01:03:06,265 --> 01:03:08,028
No!

700
01:03:08,568 --> 01:03:11,093
No, it can't be!

701
01:03:12,305 --> 01:03:14,773
How can it be? How can...

702
01:03:15,341 --> 01:03:16,933
How can it be?

703
01:03:17,143 --> 01:03:19,407
-Maybe we got lost.
-lf we were lost...

704
01:03:19,612 --> 01:03:22,080
we would have come out
at the same side of the road.

705
01:03:22,281 --> 01:03:24,010
-Somebody is fucking with us.
-Calm down.

706
01:03:24,217 --> 01:03:27,846
I don't wanna calm down!
I want this shit to stop!

707
01:03:34,727 --> 01:03:36,888
-It's still locked.
-So what?

708
01:03:37,096 --> 01:03:41,123
So who turned on the lights?
Who turned them on?

709
01:03:55,414 --> 01:03:57,382
Laura?

710
01:04:04,557 --> 01:04:07,082
-I'm not getting back in that car.
-Me neither.

711
01:04:10,296 --> 01:04:12,059
What are you writing?

712
01:04:12,265 --> 01:04:16,361
Things I wanna do
when this is over.

713
01:04:18,170 --> 01:04:20,502
So?

714
01:04:24,977 --> 01:04:26,945
Do you want me to help you?

715
01:04:29,715 --> 01:04:32,912
-What about playing bridge?
-How old do you think I am?

716
01:04:33,119 --> 01:04:35,952
I wanna do something... cool.

717
01:04:36,155 --> 01:04:40,558
I wanna buy an Atari, a computer,
a bunch of videogames.

718
01:04:40,760 --> 01:04:44,093
If you wanna do something cool,
then I'd go for the PlayStation.

719
01:04:44,830 --> 01:04:46,821
What's that?

720
01:04:47,767 --> 01:04:50,600
Never mind.
Atari is cooler anyway.

721
01:04:51,370 --> 01:04:58,037
Maybe buy some of those
Marilyn Bronson CDs.

722
01:04:58,711 --> 01:05:00,736
Manson.

723
01:05:13,526 --> 01:05:18,054
-What did you write?
-That's none of your business.

724
01:05:24,437 --> 01:05:26,302
Stop!

725
01:05:28,708 --> 01:05:31,404
-What's going on?
-I knew it.

726
01:05:31,877 --> 01:05:35,813
Somebody is playing with us.
That's the same cabin as before.

727
01:05:36,015 --> 01:05:39,280
There's probably 1 00 ranger stations
on this road. It can't be the same one.

728
01:05:39,485 --> 01:05:42,283
No, it can't be. But it is.

729
01:05:50,363 --> 01:05:53,161
-Oh, shit! Go get the flashlight.
-No.

730
01:05:53,366 --> 01:05:55,891
Go get the flashlight!

731
01:06:56,262 --> 01:06:57,661
Marion?

732
01:07:04,837 --> 01:07:06,964
What are you doing?

733
01:07:07,173 --> 01:07:08,834
Stop it! Stop it!

734
01:07:09,041 --> 01:07:12,033
-There's someone in here! I know it!
-Dad, stop it!

735
01:07:20,052 --> 01:07:22,782
We are damned.

736
01:07:30,696 --> 01:07:33,164
Dad, come on.

737
01:07:34,266 --> 01:07:37,292
No road goes on forever.

738
01:07:43,776 --> 01:07:46,176
Where the fog come from?

739
01:07:46,378 --> 01:07:48,972
-There's no fog, dad.
-No fog?

740
01:07:49,181 --> 01:07:52,981
Somebody needs to pay a visit to
Dr. Sacks to get her eyes checked.

741
01:07:53,953 --> 01:07:57,354
-Where's the whiskey?
-I threw it away, remember?

742
01:07:57,556 --> 01:07:59,217
What?

743
01:08:00,226 --> 01:08:04,663
You threw away my whiskey?
My whiskey? Ungrateful little brat.

744
01:08:04,864 --> 01:08:07,492
-Dad, calm down.
-You think because I'm weak...

745
01:08:07,700 --> 01:08:10,533
...you can start messing with me?
-Dad, listen to me.

746
01:08:12,338 --> 01:08:14,863
What are you doing?

747
01:08:15,975 --> 01:08:18,705
That'll teach you to think twice
before you touch my booze.

748
01:08:18,911 --> 01:08:20,139
Dad, please. Please.

749
01:08:20,346 --> 01:08:22,177
Shut up! Shut up!

750
01:08:24,216 --> 01:08:25,615
God damn you!

751
01:08:37,229 --> 01:08:39,094
Marion?

752
01:08:39,565 --> 01:08:41,396
Marion?

753
01:08:41,600 --> 01:08:45,934
Marion? My baby!
Oh, God, what did I do?

754
01:08:47,173 --> 01:08:49,437
What did I do?

755
01:08:55,714 --> 01:08:57,545
Oh, my baby...

756
01:09:18,704 --> 01:09:21,366
So, you've come for her, huh?

757
01:09:21,574 --> 01:09:24,202
Well, you'll have to kill me first,
you bitch!

758
01:09:25,511 --> 01:09:28,309
Why us, huh? Why?

759
01:09:28,614 --> 01:09:33,210
What did we ever do to you?
All we wanted was a nice Christmas.

760
01:09:34,153 --> 01:09:38,089
Is that too much to ask,
to have a nice Christmas?

761
01:09:38,290 --> 01:09:41,259
Come on out!
Where are you hiding?

762
01:09:41,927 --> 01:09:44,259
Come on! I'll give you a taste
of your own medicine, you bitch!

763
01:09:44,463 --> 01:09:46,226
I'll send you right straight back...

764
01:10:06,652 --> 01:10:08,643
Dad? Dad?

765
01:10:11,624 --> 01:10:14,286
He is dead.

766
01:10:18,163 --> 01:10:21,690
-He is dead!
-Oh, God!

767
01:10:22,701 --> 01:10:24,566
Get started!

768
01:10:46,225 --> 01:10:49,092
Come on. Come on!

769
01:10:49,295 --> 01:10:52,025
Start! Come on!

770
01:11:35,541 --> 01:11:38,135
Let's end it!

771
01:11:42,414 --> 01:11:44,746
Come on!

772
01:11:45,617 --> 01:11:51,419
Stop playing with me!
Please! Please!

773
01:12:56,321 --> 01:12:59,256
He's not here for you!

774
01:13:34,860 --> 01:13:36,623
Dad!

775
01:13:45,304 --> 01:13:48,398
Don't try to talk.
Everything is gonna be okay now.

776
01:13:48,607 --> 01:13:51,633
-Just try to get some rest, okay?
-I'm pregnant.

777
01:13:51,844 --> 01:13:54,039
It's all right, Marion.
We know.

778
01:13:54,246 --> 01:13:56,976
Both of you are gonna be fine.

779
01:14:08,026 --> 01:14:11,553
-How is she?
-Are you a member of the family?

780
01:14:11,763 --> 01:14:14,561
No, I'm the one who found them.
I reported the accident.

781
01:14:14,766 --> 01:14:19,135
She was lucky, she was
thrown out of the car.

782
01:14:19,338 --> 01:14:22,671
Been in a coma for a few hours, but
she's gonna be fine. A few broken...

783
01:14:22,875 --> 01:14:26,777
...ribs and a concussion.
-But the others died.

784
01:14:34,920 --> 01:14:39,653
-Do they know what happened?
-According to the police...

785
01:14:40,692 --> 01:14:44,924
father must have fallen asleep
and crashed into an oncoming car.

786
01:14:45,464 --> 01:14:49,298
-A woman and her baby.
-They died too.

787
01:15:08,587 --> 01:15:10,578
Well...

788
01:15:12,591 --> 01:15:16,857
thank you. Thank you for
what you did. Doctor...

789
01:15:17,596 --> 01:15:21,293
-Marcott. Helen Marcott.
-Thank you, Doctor Marcott.

790
01:15:28,440 --> 01:15:31,102
Not again.

791
01:15:33,845 --> 01:15:35,813
Shit.

792
01:15:37,382 --> 01:15:38,440
Hey!

793
01:15:40,319 --> 01:15:42,549
-Nice car.
-Yeah, I'm a collector.

794
01:15:42,754 --> 01:15:46,281
-Can I give you a lift?
-Why not?

795
01:16:28,667 --> 01:16:31,864
Must have been a messy one.
Broken glass everywhere.

796
01:16:33,105 --> 01:16:36,006
I should be at home
stuffing myself today.

797
01:16:36,208 --> 01:16:38,233
So should they.

798
01:16:48,387 --> 01:16:50,412
Did you drop this?

799
01:16:50,622 --> 01:16:53,113
No, what have you got there?

800
