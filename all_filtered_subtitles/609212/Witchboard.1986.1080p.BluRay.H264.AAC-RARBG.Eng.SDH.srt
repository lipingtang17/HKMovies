[INDISTINCT CHATTER]

2
00:02:23,727 --> 00:02:27,017
I'm always telling you that's the
problem. That is the problem.

3
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:38,907
Well if you don't believe
in God, Brandon,

4
00:02:38,909 --> 00:02:40,539
then how do you explain
the creation of

5
00:02:40,536 --> 00:02:41,486
the universe?

6
00:02:41,495 --> 00:02:43,995
How do you explain
the creation of God?

7
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:46,617
- He's always existed.
- So has the universe.

8
00:02:46,625 --> 00:02:47,915
Bullshit.

9
00:02:48,544 --> 00:02:52,384
Why? Why is that harder to
accept than your God?

10
00:02:52,381 --> 00:02:56,051
There is no way that intelligent life
could have formed so quickly

11
00:02:56,051 --> 00:02:58,141
without some kind of
divine intervention.

12
00:02:58,929 --> 00:03:02,559
Come on, Roger, now you can't honestly
count someone like Jim here as

13
00:03:02,558 --> 00:03:03,768
intelligent life, can you?

14
00:03:04,726 --> 00:03:10,186
That's good. I'm impressed, Brandon.
I mean, that's almost witty.

15
00:03:12,401 --> 00:03:13,991
Almost.

16
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:16,820
I'm gonna get another drink.

17
00:03:17,698 --> 00:03:20,368
Like father, like son, huh?

18
00:03:28,542 --> 00:03:31,792
You just don't know
when to quit, do you?

19
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:37,760
- Michael, I'm waiting.
- Okay.

20
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:40,469
How does he do this?

21
00:03:40,929 --> 00:03:42,219
Speak of the devil.

22
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:45,352
Don't. I've had enough religious
discussion for one night.

23
00:03:45,893 --> 00:03:46,733
What?

24
00:03:46,727 --> 00:03:50,147
- When did you guys get here?
- Just walked in, man.

25
00:03:50,147 --> 00:03:53,017
What, are you leaving me out there
with Lyndon's, uh, law school chum?

26
00:03:53,025 --> 00:03:55,645
- Sorry.
- Priorities, man.

27
00:03:56,069 --> 00:04:00,069
Jack first, hello second.
Whatcha drinkin'?

28
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:02,873
Whatever's handy.

29
00:04:03,827 --> 00:04:06,447
Look, Jim, everyone is
kind of fancy out there.

30
00:04:06,455 --> 00:04:08,745
You sure we're not a
little under dressed?

31
00:04:08,749 --> 00:04:13,039
No, man, I think they're
a little overdressed.

32
00:04:13,045 --> 00:04:14,045
Alright.

33
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:18,588
Speaking of which, who's the guy
in the eight hundred dollar suit?

34
00:04:18,592 --> 00:04:23,182
- He's Brandon Sinclair.
- Of the Sinclair Vineyards?

35
00:04:23,847 --> 00:04:24,967
Mhm.

36
00:04:24,973 --> 00:04:28,983
- Linda used to date him.
- I'm impressed.

37
00:04:28,977 --> 00:04:30,387
So's he.

38
00:04:30,979 --> 00:04:31,979
Jealous?

39
00:04:34,024 --> 00:04:38,694
Jim? Hi, Lloyd. Hi, Mike.

40
00:04:38,695 --> 00:04:39,815
Hi.

41
00:04:41,198 --> 00:04:44,158
Well, I guess we'll go
rinse out some things.

42
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:46,198
Sorry. Excuse me.

43
00:04:53,543 --> 00:04:55,173
Are you alright?

44
00:04:57,256 --> 00:04:59,916
I told you he was an asshole.

45
00:04:59,925 --> 00:05:01,625
I know you did.

46
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:06,257
You gonna come back
out to the party?

47
00:05:07,766 --> 00:05:09,226
In a minute.

48
00:05:12,104 --> 00:05:14,614
Look, can you just go
play hostess, you know?

49
00:05:14,606 --> 00:05:16,976
Try to come up with
some clean jokes, okay?

50
00:05:18,986 --> 00:05:20,526
Okay.

51
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:27,075
Jim.

52
00:05:27,619 --> 00:05:29,699
I love you.

53
00:05:33,667 --> 00:05:35,327
I know.

54
00:05:57,816 --> 00:06:00,776
How can you believe in spirits if
you don't believe in God or Satan?

55
00:06:01,528 --> 00:06:04,198
There's been evidence
of their existence.

56
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:06,367
Eyewitness accounts, photographs,

57
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:08,116
recordings, you name it.

58
00:06:08,952 --> 00:06:11,082
And I've contacted some of them.

59
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:12,909
With what, a wee-gee board?

60
00:06:13,081 --> 00:06:15,081
- Ouija.
- What?

61
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:17,383
It's pronounced, "Ouija,"
not "wee-gee."

62
00:06:17,878 --> 00:06:23,218
It comes from the French and German
words for yes: "Oui" and "Ja." Ouija.

63
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:26,887
And this is a planchette.

64
00:06:28,055 --> 00:06:30,595
I don't care what you
call it, dude. It's just

65
00:06:30,599 --> 00:06:32,639
like a game. Like checkers, or chess.

66
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:35,440
For your information,
"dude," the Ouija board

67
00:06:35,437 --> 00:06:37,477
has been around since
recorded history.

68
00:06:37,481 --> 00:06:41,231
It was in wide use as
far back as 540 B.C.

69
00:06:41,985 --> 00:06:43,985
I guess if Barbie dolls
had been around

70
00:06:43,987 --> 00:06:46,157
for that long you'd be
talking to them too.

71
00:06:46,156 --> 00:06:48,656
[LAUGHING] Beats talking to you.

72
00:06:49,034 --> 00:06:51,584
Well, that's because I use words
with more than one syllable.

73
00:06:51,578 --> 00:06:53,448
Oh, would you like to talk about that?

74
00:06:53,455 --> 00:06:56,165
- Yeah.
- Um, look, guys...

75
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:58,956
Can we play a bit of the
game? That would be fun.

76
00:06:59,836 --> 00:07:00,836
Alright.

77
00:07:01,004 --> 00:07:03,884
Now, for the best results,
the Ouija should

78
00:07:03,882 --> 00:07:06,512
be used by two people,
preferably a man

79
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:08,470
and a woman. And it
shouldn't be sitting on

80
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:10,430
a table. It should sit
on our knees so that

81
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:12,770
there's as much body
contact as possible.

82
00:07:12,766 --> 00:07:17,476
Also, the two people should
have clean, pure systems,

83
00:07:17,479 --> 00:07:19,979
so that the energy flowing
from us to the

84
00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:22,231
planchette is as strong as it can be.

85
00:07:22,234 --> 00:07:26,284
Are you saying that the spirits
actually come through our bodies?

86
00:07:26,947 --> 00:07:28,737
Oh, don't worry. It's perfectly safe.

87
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:31,082
I don't think I quite
understand what you

88
00:07:31,076 --> 00:07:32,406
mean by a clean system, though.

89
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:37,830
Someone who doesn't
smoke or drink, like you.

90
00:07:39,626 --> 00:07:41,086
Care to give it a try?

91
00:07:41,711 --> 00:07:44,001
No, I don't think so...

92
00:07:44,005 --> 00:07:48,425
[TOGETHER]
Come on, come on. Jeez,
just give it a try. Come on!

93
00:07:49,177 --> 00:07:52,007
- Alright.
- Alright, good. Alright!

94
00:07:52,764 --> 00:07:56,814
Good. I don't smoke either, and
I haven't been drinking tonight.

95
00:07:57,519 --> 00:08:00,809
So together, we should be able
to make a clear, strong contact.

96
00:08:05,986 --> 00:08:08,276
I'll bet he wants a
clear, strong contact.

97
00:08:09,865 --> 00:08:12,065
Alright, one more thing
before we begin.

98
00:08:13,201 --> 00:08:16,661
The spirits are lousy spellers
and a lot of them like to lie.

99
00:08:16,663 --> 00:08:20,543
So just to play it safe, I'm gonna
try to contact David.

100
00:08:20,542 --> 00:08:23,382
The spirit of a little boy who
died about thirty years ago.

101
00:08:24,588 --> 00:08:27,338
You mean you've actually
talked to this spirit before?

102
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:29,340
Yeah, I've contacted
him several times.

103
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:32,182
For some reason he is connected
to this particular board.

104
00:08:32,179 --> 00:08:33,179
Why's that?

105
00:08:33,472 --> 00:08:36,182
Well, I don't know, really.
It's just that every Ouija

106
00:08:36,183 --> 00:08:38,433
board seems to have
its own dominant spirit.

107
00:08:38,435 --> 00:08:41,645
Maybe it's because this board
was made the day David died.

108
00:08:42,189 --> 00:08:44,019
How do you know when
that board was made?

109
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:46,071
David told me.

110
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:49,490
How do you know he
wasn't lying. You said

111
00:08:49,488 --> 00:08:51,988
they liked to lie.
Didn't you say that?

112
00:08:52,699 --> 00:08:56,489
Uh, I'd really like to try this.

113
00:08:58,914 --> 00:08:59,914
Alright.

114
00:09:06,254 --> 00:09:11,434
David. Are you here?
Can you hear me?

115
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:23,519
- Can I talk to him?
- Yeah, go ahead.

116
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:28,230
How old are you, David?

117
00:09:30,195 --> 00:09:31,985
Uh, thank you very
much. Goodbye.

118
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:34,068
- Why did you stop?
- Oh, that wasn't David.

119
00:09:34,074 --> 00:09:36,784
- Well then who was it?
- I don't know.

120
00:09:36,785 --> 00:09:38,785
Like I said, they like
to lie sometimes.

121
00:09:39,454 --> 00:09:43,834
Well, David was ten when
he died, not eight.

122
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:47,133
Besides, we have a special signal
that no other spirit knows.

123
00:09:47,128 --> 00:09:49,508
Ooh. That's a little spooky.

124
00:09:49,506 --> 00:09:52,296
- It's a little stupid.
- It's a lot stupid.

125
00:10:01,101 --> 00:10:02,851
David, can you hear me?

126
00:10:04,938 --> 00:10:06,898
Would you like to talk to us?

127
00:10:11,945 --> 00:10:13,355
David, is that you?

128
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:24,790
- It's doing a figure eight.
- That's David's signal.

129
00:10:26,209 --> 00:10:27,589
Would you like to speak to him?

130
00:10:28,962 --> 00:10:31,212
Yeah, I would.

131
00:10:32,382 --> 00:10:33,422
David?

132
00:10:36,845 --> 00:10:38,885
I don't know what to say to him.

133
00:10:39,723 --> 00:10:42,433
David. Do you know me?

134
00:10:48,398 --> 00:10:51,068
David, will you return
to the living one day?

135
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:57,197
- Reincarnation?
- That's what they all say.

136
00:10:58,992 --> 00:10:59,992
David.

137
00:11:00,785 --> 00:11:03,825
Will you be able to choose your
parents when you return?

138
00:11:06,625 --> 00:11:07,875
Bullshit.

139
00:11:08,418 --> 00:11:10,958
What? You can't believe
you were stupid

140
00:11:10,962 --> 00:11:12,842
enough to pick your parents?

141
00:11:13,548 --> 00:11:15,588
Hey, I don't talk to cardboard.

142
00:11:16,468 --> 00:11:20,258
- Careful, Jim, you're upsetting David.
- What's he gonna do, haunt me?

143
00:11:20,263 --> 00:11:21,683
David, are you all right?

144
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:24,521
He's alright. He's just
a little dead, that's all.

145
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:27,687
Shut up, Jim! David,
are you all right?

146
00:11:28,438 --> 00:11:30,188
Brandon, it's really racing.

147
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:35,900
Yeah, maybe he's late for the
last flight back to limbo.

148
00:11:50,001 --> 00:11:53,131
- What was that noise?
- Sounded like a gunshot.

149
00:11:53,672 --> 00:11:55,712
'Scuse me, folks. Pardon me.

150
00:11:57,926 --> 00:12:02,636
Oh, man, multiple sadness.
Who owns the red Cobra?

151
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:07,269
- I do, why?
- Your tires are history, bud.

152
00:12:12,691 --> 00:12:13,981
Thanks a lot, Morar.

153
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:17,363
- What? This is my fault?
- Those were brand new tires!

154
00:12:17,362 --> 00:12:19,282
Now how do you explain it?

155
00:12:20,156 --> 00:12:23,026
I don't know man, maybe
your buddy Casper did it.

156
00:12:23,034 --> 00:12:25,624
That's right. Because
you made him angry.

157
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:28,579

The ropes holding the sheet
rock on the scaffolding

were cut, apparently with
some sort of hatchet.

No. None that I know of.

when the sheet rock fell.

Now, is there any
chance that the killer

could have been aiming for you?

636
00:55:12,184 --> 00:55:14,144
Jim, it's Brandon. We have to talk.

637
00:55:19,858 --> 00:55:21,188
Alright, I'll buzz you up.

638
00:55:22,444 --> 00:55:24,324
Okay, but meet me
in the upstairs lobby.

639
00:55:40,045 --> 00:55:41,415
- What's up?
- Where's Linda?

640
00:55:41,714 --> 00:55:43,554
She's asleep, man. Why?

641
00:55:45,134 --> 00:55:46,384
Come here.

642
00:55:49,221 --> 00:55:51,391
Zarabeth is dead.

643
00:55:52,308 --> 00:55:53,058
What?

644
00:55:53,058 --> 00:55:54,818
Someone or something
pushed her out a window.

645
00:55:55,561 --> 00:55:57,561
Jesus Christ.

646
00:55:57,563 --> 00:55:59,613
She suspected something
about David, she was

647
00:55:59,606 --> 00:56:01,726
going to check on it. I
think David killed her.

648
00:56:02,651 --> 00:56:04,571
Wait a minute, man.
The spirit killed her?

649
00:56:04,570 --> 00:56:06,280
Yes, and I think he cut the
phone line too, so I

650
00:56:06,280 --> 00:56:08,280
couldn't warn Linda about
the Ouija, and he

651
00:56:08,282 --> 00:56:09,492
probably killed Lloyd.

652
00:56:09,491 --> 00:56:11,331
But that time I think
he was after you.

653
00:56:11,327 --> 00:56:13,237
Man, are you listening to yourself?

654
00:56:13,829 --> 00:56:16,039
You're telling me there's
a ten-year-old ghost

655
00:56:16,040 --> 00:56:18,000
flying around Fairfield
killing people.

656
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:19,000
Look.

657
00:56:19,168 --> 00:56:22,378
I know it sounds crazy but
I am sure that I'm right.

658
00:56:23,005 --> 00:56:26,545
I mean, assuming that you are,
why would he wait until now?

659
00:56:26,842 --> 00:56:29,222
You contacted him long before Linda.

660
00:56:29,219 --> 00:56:33,469
I've never been alone. I've always had
people with me when I use the Ouija.

661
00:56:33,474 --> 00:56:35,274
OK, so you took it home.

662
00:56:36,643 --> 00:56:40,983
No. I checked the box this
morning. No Ouija.

663
00:56:41,648 --> 00:56:44,278
Man, that's impossible,
I boxed it myself.

664
00:56:44,276 --> 00:56:46,396
Well, maybe Linda removed
it when you weren't

665
00:56:46,403 --> 00:56:48,113
looking. She's obsessed with it, Jim!

666
00:56:48,113 --> 00:56:51,033
That means that she's already fallen
into progressive entrapment.

667
00:56:51,950 --> 00:56:54,870
Well, then I just have to find the
damn thing and get rid of it.

668
00:56:54,870 --> 00:56:57,120
It's too late for that.
Linda is so open now,

669
00:56:57,122 --> 00:56:59,042
I don't think David needs it anymore.

670
00:57:00,793 --> 00:57:03,093
You told me that that's where
he got his power.

671
00:57:03,462 --> 00:57:06,712
It's just a portal. Most
spirits are trapped in their

672
00:57:06,715 --> 00:57:09,675
world and can't enter ours
without some kind of

673
00:57:09,676 --> 00:57:11,386
help, like a medium or a Ouija.

674
00:57:11,387 --> 00:57:14,807
Or someone that's been opened
by progressive entrapment.

675
00:57:17,017 --> 00:57:18,017
Yes.

676
00:57:22,648 --> 00:57:25,268
You're telling me that Linda
is a portal for David.

677
00:57:27,778 --> 00:57:28,778
Eventually.

678

He'll possess her, unless
we can stop him.

That's why I'm going to Big Bear.

What's in Big Bear?

681
00:57:37,329 --> 00:57:39,999
That's where David claims he died.

682
00:57:39,998 --> 00:57:42,498
Now I have to go there and
check out his story.

We can't fight unless we know exactly
who he is and how powerful he is.

684

For all I know, he's been lying to me
since the first time I contacted him.

685

You're really going up there?

Wait, you gonna leave now?

keep an eye on Linda.

Don't move, asshole!

959
01:30:08,987 --> 01:30:11,697
The rest of you people go back
down to your apartments, now!

960
01:30:16,328 --> 01:30:18,968
I understand you left quite a mess
up there in Big Bear, Mr. Morar.

961
01:30:20,207 --> 01:30:21,707
Duherst, listen.

962
01:30:22,959 --> 01:30:24,169
It's not what you think.

963
01:30:25,670 --> 01:30:27,550
Listen to me. Don't...

964
01:30:30,842 --> 01:30:32,392
Mrs. Brewster, can you stand?

965
01:30:45,857 --> 01:30:48,317
You won't kill her, James.

966
01:30:48,610 --> 01:30:50,070
I'll just shoot her in the leg.

967
01:30:52,531 --> 01:30:54,241
That won't change anything.

968
01:30:56,368 --> 01:30:57,658
It'll buy us some time.

969
01:30:59,955 --> 01:31:02,455
Time to fight you. Time for
Linda to close the portal.

970
01:31:04,835 --> 01:31:06,665
Only you can do that, James.

971
01:31:07,170 --> 01:31:08,170
Put it down.

972
01:31:10,090 --> 01:31:11,170
Put it down!

973
01:31:18,432 --> 01:31:21,482
You're so... smart.

974
01:31:26,314 --> 01:31:28,614
You haven't figured it out
yet, have you, James?

975
01:31:32,696 --> 01:31:33,856
You're the portal.

976
01:31:34,656 --> 01:31:35,696
Not Linda.

977
01:31:37,868 --> 01:31:39,238
You're the one I opened.

978
01:31:39,953 --> 01:31:42,663
You're the one I terrorized
by torturing

979
01:31:42,664 --> 01:31:44,834
Linda and killing your friends.

980
01:31:47,794 --> 01:31:51,384
And it's mine as long as you live.

981
01:31:52,466 --> 01:31:53,466
Bullshit.

982
01:31:54,551 --> 01:31:56,431
Bullshit, you tried to kill me.

983
01:31:57,387 --> 01:32:01,677
No. Just to scare you.

984
01:32:03,226 --> 01:32:04,806
You're the portal, James.

985
01:32:08,732 --> 01:32:12,112
Want to save Linda? That's right.

986
01:32:13,361 --> 01:32:16,361
You've got the means right there in
your hands. Go ahead, James.

987
01:32:19,201 --> 01:32:20,831
Close the portal.

988
01:32:22,662 --> 01:32:24,002
But you won't.

989
01:32:28,627 --> 01:32:29,707
You can't.

990
01:32:31,296 --> 01:32:36,876
You don't love her that much.
Not that much.

991
01:32:41,515 --> 01:32:42,595
Linda.

992
01:32:43,600 --> 01:32:45,180
Is she worth it, James?

993
01:32:47,687 --> 01:32:52,267
Is anybody really worth it?
Think about it.

994
01:32:58,740 --> 01:32:59,740
Jim, don't!

995
01:33:57,465 --> 01:34:00,085
I now pronounce you man and wife.

996
01:34:00,093 --> 01:34:02,303
You may kiss the bride.

997
01:34:04,347 --> 01:34:06,967
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]

998
01:34:25,493 --> 01:34:27,163
Look what I found.

999
01:34:31,207 --> 01:34:36,497
A Ouija board. Gee, I haven't seen
one of these since I was a kid.

1000
01:34:36,504 --> 01:34:38,514
I didn't know they've
been around that long.

1001
01:34:41,635 --> 01:34:42,885
I wonder if it still works.

1002
01:34:43,261 --> 01:34:46,181
With all those holes in it?
