00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:13,309
女子監獄 第二季 第六集

2
00:01:14,491 --> 00:01:16,743
我覺得愛是什么啊 
What do I think love is?

3
00:01:19,579 --> 00:01:22,081
看見他就讓你覺得很緊張 
It's like when someone makes your stomach feel all tight,

4
00:01:22,166 --> 00:01:25,710
卻又輕飄飄的  你懂吧
but floaty at the same time, you know?

5
00:01:25,794 --> 00:01:29,130
臉都笑抽筋了 
And your cheeks hurt from smiling.

6
00:01:29,214 --> 00:01:32,842
一直笑得別人以為你有病 
And you smile so much that people think something's wrong with you.

7
00:01:32,926 --> 00:01:34,719
愛云淡風輕 
Love is light.

8
00:01:36,805 --> 00:01:38,640
是包容 
Acceptance.

9
00:01:41,518 --> 00:01:42,561
是激情 
Fire.

10
00:01:42,644 --> 00:01:43,978
痛苦 
Pain.

11
00:01:45,355 --> 00:01:46,898
刻骨銘心的痛苦 
Horrible pain.

12
00:01:48,608 --> 00:01:50,109
你卻忍不住一再親近 
That you want again and again.

13
00:01:50,194 --> 00:01:52,196
還有做愛 And also, fucking.

14
00:01:52,279 --> 00:01:56,450
不間斷深入地  操得下不了地 Twenty-four seven, deep-dick, can't-walk-right fucking.

15
00:01:57,742 --> 00:02:03,665
我啊  一談到愛情根本停不下來 Well, you know me. I got so much to say about love.

16
00:02:06,501 --> 00:02:11,756
有一年啊  那個華爾街高富帥帶我坐直升機去了華盛頓 And one year, this Wall Street guy flew me in a helicopter to D.C.

17
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,300
真的嗎 For serious?

18
00:02:13,383 --> 00:02:16,010
情人節男人干嘛都有可能  他們最愛這個節日了 Valentine's Day makes guys go crazy. They love it.

19
00:02:16,094 --> 00:02:18,930
男人最恨情人節了 Men hate Valentine's Day.

20
00:02:19,013 --> 00:02:20,307
至少看上去沒有啊 They don't act like they hate it.

21
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:22,601
那是因為你長得美  跟索菲婭·沃加拉一樣 That's because you look like Sofia Vergara.

22
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:22,601
《摩登家庭》女主角

23
00:02:22,684 --> 00:02:23,699
她的胸倒貨真價實 Them things is real. 

24
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:25,604
有次我看見她在翠貝卡區跑步 I once saw her jogging in Tribeca.

25
00:02:25,687 --> 00:02:29,899
伊恩好久沒來看我了  他要是明天來看我就好了 Ian hasn't visited in so long. It'd be nice if he showed up tomorrow.

26
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:33,987
可他只有一輛小摩托  騎過來太冷了 But he's only got a Vespa and it's too cold to ride this far.

27
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:37,616
有一次亞迪爾送了我花  從他親戚葬禮上順的 One year, Yadriel got me flowers. He stole them from his cousin's funeral.

28
00:02:37,699 --> 00:02:39,284
-好甜蜜呀  -拜托 - It was so sweet. - Please.

29
00:02:39,368 --> 00:02:42,078
情人節就這樣  要是不扮成完美情人 Valentine's Day was invented to make people feel like shit

30
00:02:42,161 --> 00:02:44,122
就會死一樣 if they're not part of some perfect couple.

31
00:02:44,205 --> 00:02:45,206
沒錯 True.

32
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:47,775
迪艾保說這世上沒有完美情人 Diablo says there are no perfect couples, 

33
00:02:47,776 --> 00:02:49,878
但每一對都各有其美 but each couple is perfect in its own way.

34
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:54,508
情人節還被關著  一定很難受吧 It must be hard. Being locked up on Valentine's Day.

35
00:02:55,717 --> 00:02:56,718
沒別的意思 That's all.

36
00:02:56,801 --> 00:03:00,722
謝謝  費歇爾  你真為我們著想 Aw. Thank you, Fischer. That was really empathetic of you.

37
00:03:01,723 --> 00:03:03,725
-要來塊餅干嗎  -好啊  謝謝 - You want a cookie? - Oh, sure. Thank you.

38
00:03:15,987 --> 00:03:18,114
-你要喝點水嗎  費歇爾  -沒事 - You need some water, Fischer? - No. I'm fine.

39
00:03:19,283 --> 00:03:21,576
就知道她沒口活過 I knew she didn't swallow.

40
00:03:32,962 --> 00:03:34,881
嗨 Hi.

41
00:03:34,964 --> 00:03:37,592
你明晚訂了哪里 Where'd you make reservations for tomorrow night?

42
00:03:38,802 --> 00:03:39,803
什么 Wait, what?

43
00:03:41,095 --> 00:03:43,265
我正假裝我們是一對情人啊 I'm trying to pretend like we're a normal couple.

44
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:44,724
這樣啊 Oh.

45
00:03:46,393 --> 00:03:50,355
我在洛倫佐餐廳訂了兩個座位 Um, well, I got us a table for two at Lorenzo's.

46
00:03:50,439 --> 00:03:51,731
就在壁爐旁 The one by the fireplace.

47
00:03:53,317 --> 00:03:55,748
等不及給你看我的新裙子 I can't wait for you to see my dress. 

48
00:03:55,749 --> 00:03:57,737
很性感卻不浪蕩 It's sexy, but not slutty, you know?

49
00:04:00,114 --> 00:04:01,450
迫不及待 I can't wait to see it.

50
00:04:02,534 --> 00:04:06,245
再給去我拿包面粉好嗎 Mamita, can you get me another bag of flour?

51
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:13,462
給你 Here.

52
00:04:14,671 --> 00:04:18,049
-這是啥  -是清單 - What's this? - It's a list.

53
00:04:18,132 --> 00:04:20,552
要哄你的岳母開心啊  知道嗎 Wanna keep the mother-in-law happy, right?

54
00:04:20,635 --> 00:04:23,388
我想著或許可以借用一下你的假肢 I figured I might as well make use of Sleepy Hollow

55
00:04:23,472 --> 00:04:25,181
免得再節外生枝 before the other shoe drops.

56
00:04:25,264 --> 00:04:26,558
明白嗎 Get it?

57
00:04:30,561 --> 00:04:32,159
由于無法避免的維修因素  淋浴要限制在30秒內

58
00:04:32,814 --> 00:04:36,067
這就是維給我們爭取來的  用這種破龍頭洗澡 So this is what Vee negotiated for us? Using these broke-ass showers?

59
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:38,653
-這什么破談判啊  -你說呢 - Man, that's some broke-ass negotiation. - You think?

60
00:04:38,737 --> 00:04:42,407
你們知道洗澡時間太長對人不好吧 You do know that long showers are bad for you.

61
00:04:42,491 --> 00:04:45,243
對表皮細胞什么不好 Mess with your keratinocytes and whatnots.

62
00:04:45,327 --> 00:04:47,662
蘇珊娜  你他媽給我閉嘴 Hey, Suzanne? Shut the fuck up.

63
00:04:52,334 --> 00:04:55,086
為什么要我離開圖書館 Yeah, why the hell would I leave the library?

64
00:04:55,169 --> 00:04:56,588
那是監獄里最好的工作了 It's the best job here.

65
00:04:56,671 --> 00:04:59,883
因為那兒錢少  付不了房租  吃不上紅酒牛肉 Because books do not pay the rent. Books do not bourguignon the beef.

66
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:01,510
我們有大生意要做 We are starting something.

67
00:05:01,593 --> 00:05:04,388
我不想去保管處 I don't wanna join custodial.

68
00:05:04,513 --> 00:05:07,599
-但我還是想要你去  -不行  我不去 - And yet I am still asking you. - No way. No.

69
00:05:07,682 --> 00:05:10,309
-快點快點  -給我閉嘴 - Oh, come on. Come on! - Shut up!

70
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:12,687
當年你跑過來跟我說 You know what? Do you know how easy it would've been

71
00:05:12,771 --> 00:05:14,272
"維  把我從教養院弄出去吧" for me to say no when you came to me and said,

72
00:05:14,356 --> 00:05:15,940
我完全可以不幫你  知道嗎 "Vee, get me out of this group home"?

73
00:05:16,024 --> 00:05:20,445
"我不想再見到那寄養父親的狗臉了" "Save me from this sick fuck-faced foster father I got!" Huh?

74
00:05:21,738 --> 00:05:24,073
-這不公平  -公平  醒醒吧 - That's not fair. - Fair? Girl, please.

75
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:26,618
哪有什么公平  你以為是排排坐吃果果 Fair's where you go get you some cotton candy.

76
00:05:26,701 --> 00:05:29,120
坐著旋轉木馬嗎 Where you ride the Tilt-A-Whirl.

77
00:05:29,203 --> 00:05:30,371
我在找杰克 I'm looking for Jack.

78
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:32,916
他不在這兒 He's not here.

79
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:35,293
他每年都給我買巧克力 He buys me chocolates every year.

80
00:05:35,376 --> 00:05:37,378
我們有固定的收入 We're on a fixed income, of course.

81
00:05:37,462 --> 00:05:40,465
但他說今晚要喂鴨子 But he's gotta treat his Duckie right, he says.

82
00:05:40,549 --> 00:05:45,053
要是他找不到我  那就浪費了 And if he can't find me, they'll be wasted.

83
00:05:47,722 --> 00:05:51,435
操  我要是變這樣  就直接掐死我 Fuck. Kill me in my sleep if I ever get like that.

84
00:05:51,518 --> 00:05:56,105
聽著  你給我好好想想  然后照我說的做 Look. You're gonna think about it, right? And then you gonna do as I say.

85
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:57,190
痛啊 Ah!

86
00:05:57,273 --> 00:05:59,859
就是很放松  懂嗎 It's just chilling, you know?

87
00:05:59,943 --> 00:06:05,031
跟人一起玩  開些很冷的玩笑啊 Kicking it with somebody, talking, making mad stupid jokes.

88
00:06:05,114 --> 00:06:08,743
一點都不想睡覺 And, like, not even wanting to go to sleep,

89
00:06:08,827 --> 00:06:13,582
這樣就會有那么段時間見不到對方 'cause then you might be without 'em for a minute.

90
00:06:13,665 --> 00:06:15,208
而你一刻都不想分開 And you don't want that.

91
00:06:15,067 --> 00:06:18,374
美國陸軍  霍恩菲爾茲駐地  多國戰備中心  德國  巴伐利亞

92
00:06:20,171 --> 00:06:21,631
一  二  三  開始 Ein, zwei, drei, go!

93
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:27,261
就快... And...

94
00:06:28,429 --> 00:06:32,433
好了  誰下一個  誰下一個 And done! Who's next? Who's next?

95
00:06:32,517 --> 00:06:33,560
厲害 Whoo!

96
00:06:33,643 --> 00:06:34,686
你贏不了我的 You can't beat me.

97
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,146
我不可超越 I am untouchable.

98
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:39,649
可我覺得你很親近 I think you are very touchable.

99
00:06:40,942 --> 00:06:43,069
找間屋子好嗎 Get a room.

100
00:06:43,152 --> 00:06:45,196
說德語  白癡  再說一遍 German, fool. Talk it.

101
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:47,156
是"旁建"  "旁間" Zing? Zinger?

102
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:50,619
是"房間"  你好歹住在這里  尊重它的語言 Das Zimmer. You're part of a community. Respect its language.

103
00:06:50,702 --> 00:06:52,286
我爸才是這圈子的 My father's part of a community.

104
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:54,789
我不過是他隨你們四處反恐時 I'm the unfortunate appendage he drags about

105
00:06:54,873 --> 00:06:57,876
攜帶的一個拖油瓶而已 wherever your fight against terror takes him.

106
00:06:58,292 --> 00:06:59,794
他在說傻話 He's just talkin' smack.

107
00:06:59,961 --> 00:07:02,881
那你這些年搬過多少次家 How many times have you had to move in your short little life?

108
00:07:02,964 --> 00:07:04,508
數不清了 Too many.

109
00:07:04,591 --> 00:07:07,802
但是我不會再搬了  我爸答應我了 But this is the end of the road. My pops promised.

110
00:07:09,428 --> 00:07:10,472
怎么用德語說 How do you say,

111
00:07:10,555 --> 00:07:15,727
"我真想看你們倆做女女之愛啊" "I'd like to watch as you two make sweet, sweet lady love," in German?

112
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:18,938
沒門  混蛋  沒門 Nein, motherfucker. Nein.

113
00:07:26,445 --> 00:07:28,406
這活兒太操蛋了 This job is bullshit.

114
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:32,160
哪有  這是道有獎勵的考驗題 No. 'Tis a rewarding puzzle.

115
00:07:32,243 --> 00:07:36,122
哪兒來的考驗  就是收拾電器 Ain't no puzzle. Makes electrical look good.

116
00:07:36,205 --> 00:07:38,875
真不敢相信我竟然聽了那老婊子的話 Can't believe I let that old bitch talk me into this.

117
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:42,211
你還是別背后指摘帕克小姐的不是 I wouldn't speak ill of Miss Parker's methods.

118
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:44,088
她耳里肯定聽不得這些話 She wouldn't tolerate such words.

119
00:07:44,172 --> 00:07:46,550
聽著  沃森有權利 Hey, now, Watson got the right

120
00:07:46,633 --> 00:07:49,135
表達她對新工作的不滿 to express her discomfort for her new job.

121
00:07:49,218 --> 00:07:51,638
就算你覺得打掃衛生沒什么問題 Just because cleaning quiets your discombobulation

122
00:07:51,721 --> 00:07:53,347
不代表別人就都一樣 doesn't mean it does so for everyone.

123
00:07:54,516 --> 00:07:57,977
說得好  掃把  說得好 Point well made, Moppet. Point well made.

124
00:08:01,355 --> 00:08:03,232
你真是蠢 You such a dumbass.

125
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:05,735
沃森  你看著很累啊 Hey, Watson, you look a little tired.

126
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:08,362
要不我晚些時候去給你按摩下股四頭肌 Maybe I could come by later and massage your quads?

127
00:08:08,446 --> 00:08:10,824
他媽給我滾遠點 Get the fuck out of here.

128
00:08:10,907 --> 00:08:12,909
不管你們這里要干什么勾當 You know, whatever y'all got going on in here.

129
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:16,245
接手了保管處  我都要分一杯羹 You know, taking over custodial. I want a piece.

130
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:20,709
我會睜只眼閉只眼  這樣什么都看不見 I use it to cover my eyes. That way, you know, I won't see anything.

131
00:08:20,792 --> 00:08:26,756
明晚  我會用我的手  讓你的情人節爽歪歪 Tomorrow night, I'm going to put the "V" in your Valentine.

132
00:08:28,091 --> 00:08:30,343
沒錯  盡情操我 That's right. Fuck me.

133
00:08:30,426 --> 00:08:33,304
沃倫  誰陪你過今年的情人節 Hey, Warren, who gonna be your Valentine this year?

134
00:08:33,387 --> 00:08:36,641
你不總是去勾搭誰嗎 You always battin' them freaky blacks at somebody.

135
00:08:36,725 --> 00:08:37,726
不不 Oh, no.

136
00:08:37,809 --> 00:08:42,063
今年我要愛一個值得我愛的人  真的 No, this year I'm loving someone who deserves me. Me.

137
00:08:43,607 --> 00:08:44,774
廢物 Loser.

138
00:08:44,858 --> 00:08:46,109
閉嘴 Shut up!

139
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:49,528
無所謂了  要我說  這是一年中最難過的時刻 Whatever. Depressing-ass time of year, you ask me.

140
00:08:49,613 --> 00:08:50,822
媽的 Motherfucker!

141
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:54,826
我操  你尿褲子了 Shit. You pissed your pants?

142
00:08:57,579 --> 00:08:59,623
我去給你找塊尿布 I'm gonna go find you a diaper.

143
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,793
請注意  探訪時間開始 Your attention, please. Visiting hours are now open.

144
00:09:03,877 --> 00:09:06,713
所有犯人均可進入探訪室 All prisoners are free to go to the visiting room.

145
00:09:10,466 --> 00:09:13,011
明天是佛羅倫薩·亨德森的生日 Tomorrow's Florence Henderson's birthday!

146
00:09:13,094 --> 00:09:14,220
什么 What?

147
00:09:14,303 --> 00:09:16,640
情人節啊  是佛羅倫薩·亨德森的生日 Valentine's Day. Florence Henderson's birthday!

148
00:09:16,723 --> 00:09:19,726
我們每年都有裸體慶祝派對 We should be having our annual naked Brady-thon celebration

149
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:22,478
我會伴著陽光天樂隊的歌跳脫衣舞 and I should be doing some kind of a striptease to Sunshine Day.

150
00:09:22,561 --> 00:09:25,899
也許...也許...再抹點油 And then maybe something... Maybe something with Wesson Oil, that...

151
00:09:25,982 --> 00:09:27,275
帕波 Piper.

152
00:09:29,944 --> 00:09:30,945
你好 Hi.

153
00:09:33,615 --> 00:09:34,741
你好 Hi.

154
00:09:36,785 --> 00:09:38,536
嗨 Hi.

155
00:09:40,622 --> 00:09:42,832
我聽說了你奶奶的事 I heard about your grandma.

156
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:47,378
萊瑞 Larry...

157
00:09:49,631 --> 00:09:51,174
我想要我的家 I want my home.

158
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:54,636
從這兒出去后 When I get out of here,

159
00:09:56,638 --> 00:09:58,014
我想回家 I wanna come home.

160
00:09:59,641 --> 00:10:01,935
這可不是小事啊 That's quite the statement.

161
00:10:06,981 --> 00:10:08,650
你確定嗎 You sure about that?

162
00:10:09,984 --> 00:10:12,821
我確定 Yeah, I'm sure.

163
00:10:14,989 --> 00:10:16,991
我不是在問你 Well, I'm not asking you.

164
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:22,872
我是在問未來的帕波  那個重獲自由的帕波 I'm asking Future Piper. Free Piper.

165
00:10:24,207 --> 00:10:26,876
你能保證你依舊想回家嗎 Can you guarantee that you still will?

166
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:29,295
未來的帕波希望能回家 Future Piper hopes so.

167
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:32,674
可是現今的萊瑞不能靠希望活著 Present Larry can't live on hope.

168
00:10:33,842 --> 00:10:35,463
我可以靠吃芥末豆花生黃油餅干 Wasabi peas and peanut butter pretzels, apparently, 

169
00:10:35,464 --> 00:10:36,970
但希望是不夠的 but not hope.

170
00:10:37,053 --> 00:10:38,096
拜托別在這兒提這些東西 Please don't mention those things

171
00:10:38,179 --> 00:10:41,057
除非你藏了什么東西要給我 unless you're hiding some up your butt for me.

172
00:10:43,852 --> 00:10:45,019
帕波 Piper,

173
00:10:47,856 --> 00:10:51,567
有個《都市郵報》的記者  安德魯·南斯 this reporter from CityPost, Andrew Nance.

174
00:10:52,401 --> 00:10:53,611
他... He, um...

175
00:10:54,696 --> 00:10:57,949
問我這里是否有資金異常的問題 He asked me about financial irregularities here.

176
00:10:58,032 --> 00:11:02,245
比如憑空出現的銷售商  從未建起的樓等 Uh... Vendors that don't exist, buildings that were never built.

177
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:04,288
于是我就想  "去你媽的 And I was like, "Fuck that.

178
00:11:05,456 --> 00:11:07,959
為什么要他寫  我來寫" "Why should he write it? I'll write it."

179
00:11:08,042 --> 00:11:09,794
寫什么 Write what?

180
00:11:09,878 --> 00:11:13,714
一篇文章  靠你從內部挖掘信息 An article. With you investigating from the inside.

181
00:11:15,133 --> 00:11:18,011
新聞自由權并非只有自由人才有  是吧 Freedom of the press shouldn't only be a privilege of the free, right?

182
00:11:18,094 --> 00:11:19,595
-你覺得怎么樣  -天哪 - What do you say? - Oh, my God.

183
00:11:19,678 --> 00:11:23,933
我的天  萊瑞  我的上帝 Oh, my God, Larry. Jesus Christ!

184
00:11:24,934 --> 00:11:25,935
-怎么了  -你又來了 - What... - You're doing it again!

185
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:28,396
你說什么啊 What are you talking about?

186
00:11:28,479 --> 00:11:31,024
我們要曝光這個地方  帕波 We'll fucking expose this place, Piper.

187
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:35,361
你就是月亮  萊瑞  不要再做月亮了 You're the moon, Larry. You have got to stop being the moon!

188
00:11:35,444 --> 00:11:36,780
月亮怎么了 What's wrong with being the moon?

189
00:11:36,863 --> 00:11:38,572
它不能自己發光 It doesn't have its own light.

190
00:11:38,656 --> 00:11:42,326
是啊  怎么了  那你就是太陽了 So, right. So, what? That makes you the sun?

191
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:44,829
你就是太陽了  是不是啊  帕波 Are you the sun, Piper? Huh?

192
00:11:44,913 --> 00:11:46,610
你是全太陽系的中心 You're the center of the solar system 

193
00:11:46,611 --> 00:11:49,250
而我就是塊毫無生氣的石頭 and I'm just a dead hunk of crap rock!

194
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:51,920
帕波  你的一切依舊到處都是 How am I supposed to become my own planet, Piper,

195
00:11:52,003 --> 00:11:55,173
我要怎么成為獨立的星球 when your shit is still everywhere?

196
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:57,967
你倒是往前看了 You get to move on.

197
00:11:58,051 --> 00:12:03,264
你還操了艾麗克斯或是誰  我卻止步不前 You get to fuck Alex or whoever's next, and I'm stuck.

198
00:12:03,347 --> 00:12:07,685
我深陷在你的衣服鞋子里 I'm stuck with your sweaters and your shoes

199
00:12:07,768 --> 00:12:11,272
還有他媽什么絲芙蘭代銷店淘來的東西 and your goddamn Sephora fucking outlet store worth of products!

200
00:12:12,481 --> 00:12:14,275
你無處不在 You are everywhere.

201
00:12:16,777 --> 00:12:19,948
就像活在石棺里 It's like living inside a sarcophagus.

202
00:12:21,324 --> 00:12:23,742
要是我的東西太礙事了你可以送去波麗那兒 Well, take my stuff to Polly's if it's so in your way.

203
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:28,539
還有你其實是想說"陵墓"而不是"石棺" And you mean "mausoleum," not "sarcophagus."

204
00:12:28,622 --> 00:12:30,166
不要再對我指手畫腳了 Don't tell me what I mean!

205
00:12:36,755 --> 00:12:38,466
至少人們還能在月亮上行走 At least people can walk on the moon.

206
00:12:40,218 --> 00:12:43,387
太陽呢  一靠近就只會燃成灰燼 Anyone gets near the sun, they burn right up.

207
00:12:49,352 --> 00:12:52,480
維說她年紀大了  我才不信呢 Vee says she's too old. Don't believe it for a second!

208
00:12:53,814 --> 00:12:55,806
那女的曾經怎么對我啊 What that woman did to me... 

209
00:12:55,807 --> 00:12:57,401
江山易改本性難移 People don't change.

210
00:12:57,485 --> 00:12:58,527
你能不能快點啊 Hurry it up, will you?

211
00:13:00,071 --> 00:13:02,406
我盡力了媽  火星濺得我臉都疼 I'm trying, Ma. The sparks are burning my cheeks!

212
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:05,201
那就把頭轉過去  你哥呢 Then turn your head! Where's your brother?

213
00:13:06,202 --> 00:13:09,580
他有幽閉恐懼癥  呆在林子里守著入口呢 He got claustrophobic. He's in the woods, guarding the entrance.

214
00:13:10,581 --> 00:13:12,500
媽媽  我好難過啊 I'm just so sad, mamochka.

215
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:14,002
真遺憾她離你而去  瓦斯里 I'm sorry she left you, Vasily,

216
00:13:14,085 --> 00:13:16,587
但我相信你也是活該 but I'm sure you did something to deserve it.

217
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:18,672
我以前會看她入睡 I used to watch her sleep

218
00:13:19,924 --> 00:13:22,927
祈禱我能強大起來  不再毀掉一切  媽媽 and pray for the strength to stop ruining everything, Ma.

219
00:13:23,011 --> 00:13:25,804
那有用嗎 And how did that work out for you?

220
00:13:25,889 --> 00:13:28,557
今天不做工  明天再來 No work today. Come back tomorrow.

221
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:30,184
杰克說他會在這兒 Jack said he would be out here.

222
00:13:30,268 --> 00:13:32,020
我看他上了輛出租車 I saw him get into a taxi.

223
00:13:32,853 --> 00:13:36,065
出租車  就在外面嗎 A taxi? Out here?

224
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:38,567
真不可思議 Imagine that.

225
00:13:39,568 --> 00:13:41,320
謝謝你  女士 Thank you, young lady.

226
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:43,864
你能不能快點啊 Hurry it up, will you?

227
00:13:55,709 --> 00:13:56,794
媽媽 Mama!

228
00:13:56,877 --> 00:13:58,613
受夠了你惡心的抱怨 You and your disgusting whining! 

229
00:13:58,614 --> 00:14:01,507
想要你的女人回來  就去追 If you want your woman back, go get her.

230
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:04,427
趕緊把東西遞給我  快點 Now hand up the shit. Come on!

231
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:11,392
等你出去時 When you get out of here...

232
00:14:11,475 --> 00:14:13,519
想過家里會有誰等著你嗎 who do you imagine yourself going home to?

233
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:16,147
《犯罪》里的費歐娜·艾波 Fiona Apple in the Criminal video.

234
00:14:17,773 --> 00:14:19,817
問得太傻了 Stupid question.

235
00:14:19,901 --> 00:14:21,069
你呢 What about you?

236
00:14:22,403 --> 00:14:23,587
我一直以為是萊瑞 I always thought it would be Larry, 

237
00:14:23,588 --> 00:14:25,364
如今看來得重新考慮了 but I think it's time to re-imagine.

238
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:30,661
這個愚蠢操蛋的節日 This stupid fucking holiday.

239
00:14:31,745 --> 00:14:33,789
你要是愿意  我能讓你忘記這一天 Listen, if you want, I can help you forget what day it is.

240
00:14:34,916 --> 00:14:37,376
甚至是你的名字 You know, or your name, for that matter.

241
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:38,502
你也知道我的答案  不要 You know, no.

242
00:14:38,586 --> 00:14:40,796
我不想在你的做愛比賽里 I am not interested in being a prize,

243
00:14:40,879 --> 00:14:45,509
做一個價碼低得不可思議的戰利品 albeit a shockingly-undervalued one, in your little sex game.

244
00:14:45,593 --> 00:14:47,303
好吧 Fine.

245
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:53,351
我失去了我愛操縱人  漂亮又變態的前任 I lost my manipulative, gorgeous, psychopath ex

246
00:14:53,434 --> 00:15:00,108
又失去了我貼心又有點不著邊的未婚夫 and my sweet, kind, unfocused fiance.

247
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:04,070
我沒有家了 I don't have a home anymore.

248
00:15:04,153 --> 00:15:05,863
不  查普曼  你有 Yeah, Chapman, you do.

249
00:15:07,198 --> 00:15:09,117
這傻逼電線 This shit pile.

250
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:11,202
真他媽甜蜜啊 Home sweet home.

251
00:15:11,285 --> 00:15:12,495
聽著  我不得不承認 Look, I gotta say,

252
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:14,747
你那不著邊的未婚夫說的什么文章  還真有點道理 your unfocused fiance is on the right track with this article shit.

253
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:18,501
我都不知道多少次修這個儀表板的短路了 I mean, this is like my 20th time trying to fix a short in this panel alone.

254
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:19,835
根本沒人花錢管 Nobody's spending money here.

255
00:15:22,964 --> 00:15:25,883
加列戈說你找我 Hey. Gallego said you were looking for me?

256
00:15:25,967 --> 00:15:29,928
喬  這些通話  真是太有意思了 Joe, these phone calls. They're amazing!

257
00:15:30,013 --> 00:15:32,098
聽這個 Listen.

258
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:34,725
我說看著他  不是操他 I said to keep an eye on him, not fuck him!

259
00:15:34,808 --> 00:15:37,145
不過是菊花入而已  不算的呀 It was only in the ass. That don't count.

260
00:15:37,228 --> 00:15:38,396
我要告訴媽媽 I'm telling Mom.

261
00:15:38,479 --> 00:15:39,563
這么勁爆 Whoa.

262
00:15:39,647 --> 00:15:42,858
是吧  太有意思了  這么多不同的生活 I know! Anyway. It's so interesting. All these lives.

263
00:15:42,941 --> 00:15:44,402
就跟讀狄更斯似的 It's like reading Dickens!

264
00:15:44,485 --> 00:15:47,571
不錯  這挺積極的 It's good. Showing initiative.

265
00:15:47,655 --> 00:15:49,865
也許這樣菲格就不會再盯著我了 Maybe it'll help get Fig off my ass.

266
00:15:49,948 --> 00:15:52,701
你知道她要求我執行記過配額嗎 You know she asked me to impose a shot quota?

267
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:54,662
太荒唐了 This is ridiculous.

268
00:15:54,745 --> 00:15:56,830
你能站出來對抗她真厲害 I love that you stand up to her.

269
00:15:59,667 --> 00:16:03,629
你跟那誰怎么樣了 So, how are things going with... What's his name?

270
00:16:05,256 --> 00:16:08,842
他們不去了  他穿太多背心了 They're not going. He wore a lot of vests.

271
00:16:08,926 --> 00:16:10,678
這樣 Ah.

272
00:16:10,761 --> 00:16:13,972
也挺常見的 Well, that happens.

273
00:16:14,057 --> 00:16:17,268
哦對了  我在一個樂隊里... You know, I play in this band...

274
00:16:17,351 --> 00:16:19,895
你玩樂隊啊 You're in a band? Wow!

275
00:16:19,978 --> 00:16:21,355
是啊 Yeah?

276
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:25,484
就是小打小鬧 Yeah. It's no big deal.

277
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:29,988
明晚我們有演出  你要不要來 We play in town tomorrow night. You wanna come?

278
00:16:30,073 --> 00:16:32,741
我要看著情人節派對 Oh, I'm working the Valentine's party.

279
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:36,079
我能幫你調開 I'll get you off.

280
00:16:38,164 --> 00:16:39,623
幫你調開值班時間 I'll get you off the schedule.

281
00:16:41,792 --> 00:16:43,961
可以幫你換班  小事情 I can get your shift covered. It's fine.

282
00:16:44,045 --> 00:16:47,298
我挺喜歡聽音樂的  一定很棒 Well, I do love music! That'd be awesome.

283
00:16:47,381 --> 00:16:48,841
-謝謝  -那好 - Thanks. - Great.

284
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:53,054
-那到時候見  -好 - I'll see you there then! - Okay.

285
00:16:57,933 --> 00:17:02,438
我在海滋客工作時和我老板有過一腿 I had this thing with my boss at Long John Silver's.

286
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:05,399
后來我發現他老婆超級辣 And then I found out his wife was wicked hot.

287
00:17:07,235 --> 00:17:09,695
所以感覺還不錯 So that was nice.

288
00:17:09,778 --> 00:17:12,156
"你怎么知道我不開心"  愛麗絲說 "'How do you know I'm mad? ' said Alice.

289
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:15,993
"一看就知道"  貓說  "不然你也不會來這里" "'You must be, ' said the Cat, 'or you wouldn't have come here.'"

290
00:17:16,077 --> 00:17:19,455
你真他媽對 Mmm. Shit. You right.

291
00:17:19,538 --> 00:17:21,915
路易斯·卡羅一定蹲過牢 Lewis Carroll must have gone to prison.

292
00:17:23,209 --> 00:17:25,378
RJ的媽媽就叫愛麗絲 RJ's mom was named Alice.

293
00:17:25,461 --> 00:17:28,005
是嗎  她也掉進兔子洞了 Oh, yeah? She fall down a rabbit hole?

294
00:17:28,089 --> 00:17:30,174
-不是  是毒窟  -這樣 - No. A crack hole. - Ah.

295
00:17:30,258 --> 00:17:33,094
然后她發現一塊石頭  上面寫著"吸了我" She found a little rock. Said "Smoke me," on it.

296
00:17:33,177 --> 00:17:36,054
這不好笑  那東西很厲害 That's not funny. That shit was serious.

297
00:17:37,598 --> 00:17:40,226
"吸了我"  真有你的 "Smoke me." You a dumbass.

298
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:42,770
杰弗遜  趕緊說再見吧  你得去保管處了 Jefferson. Say goodbye. You're on custodial now.

299
00:17:42,853 --> 00:17:44,021
現在就要去了 Already?

300
00:17:44,105 --> 00:17:47,525
-什么  你要走了  -是啊 - Wait. You leaving? - Yeah.

301
00:17:47,608 --> 00:17:50,278
還記得我跟你說維在策劃什么事嗎 Remember, I told you Vee was getting something together?

302
00:17:50,361 --> 00:17:52,946
但是你為什么要離開圖書館呢  你喜歡這里 But why would you leave the library, man? You know you love it here.

303
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:54,490
你不明白 You don't understand.

304
00:17:55,491 --> 00:17:57,118
我欠她 I owe her.

305
00:17:58,619 --> 00:18:01,872
她或許也能把你換過去吧 She could probably get you transferred, I bet.

306
00:18:01,955 --> 00:18:02,998
不會的 Nah.

307
00:18:04,167 --> 00:18:05,834
我自己心里有數 No, I know when I got it good.

308
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:10,298
好吧  那我們晚飯見了 Okay. Well, I'll see you at dinner.

309
00:18:23,977 --> 00:18:24,978
怎么樣 Anything?

310
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:26,605
再高點 Higher maybe.

311
00:18:27,105 --> 00:18:28,106
等等 Wait.

312
00:18:28,191 --> 00:18:29,192
腿抽筋了 Leg cramp.

313
00:18:29,275 --> 00:18:30,318
抱歉 Sorry.

314
00:18:34,655 --> 00:18:36,407
好了 Okay.

315
00:18:42,288 --> 00:18:43,289
太棒了 That's nice.

316
00:18:43,831 --> 00:18:45,333
-是嗎  -嗯 - Yeah? Yeah? - Yeah.

317
00:18:47,501 --> 00:18:48,502
不行 No.

318
00:18:48,586 --> 00:18:49,920
沒感覺了 It's gone.

319
00:18:50,003 --> 00:18:53,131
就跟你說交叉式行不通 I told you scissoring wasn't a thing.

320
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:08,981
說到愛情  有這么一句話 There's a saying about love.

321
00:19:10,065 --> 00:19:12,318
關于愛情有好多句話呢 There's a million sayings about love.

322
00:19:13,861 --> 00:19:15,446
我想到了其中一句 I'm thinking of the one that says,

323
00:19:15,738 --> 00:19:18,115
"愛不是互相凝視對方 "Love is not about staring at each other,

324
00:19:19,575 --> 00:19:21,827
而是望向同一個方向" but staring off in the same direction."

325
00:19:24,121 --> 00:19:25,456
我不喜歡這句 I don't like that one.

326
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:28,709
我更喜歡看著你 I love staring at you too much.

327
00:19:38,386 --> 00:19:39,428
我渴了 I'm thirsty.

328
00:19:51,774 --> 00:19:53,234
我給你擦 Let me get that.

329
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:07,122
很好 Oh, yeah.

330
00:20:08,291 --> 00:20:09,708
我還要 More.

331
00:20:13,962 --> 00:20:15,464
搞什么 What the fuck?

332
00:21:23,198 --> 00:21:25,659
-不過是這個而已  -在違禁物清單上 - Just this. - It's on the list.

333
00:21:25,743 --> 00:21:27,370
-只是水煙  -少來  艾麗卡 - It's fucking vapor! - Give me a break, Eliqua.

334
00:21:27,453 --> 00:21:31,206
卡普托今天盯著我  放回車里去  下一個 Caputo's up my ass today. Put it in your car. Next.

335
00:21:42,259 --> 00:21:44,219
現在搜身是強制的了 Pat-downs are mandatory now.

336
00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:58,275
跟你開玩笑的 I'm just kidding.

337
00:21:58,359 --> 00:22:00,778
才不想碰你的假肢呢 I don't wanna touch that peg-leg shit.

338
00:22:00,861 --> 00:22:03,697
情人節快樂  下一個 Happy Valentine's Day. Next.

339
00:22:15,042 --> 00:22:16,209
看看這些破玩意兒 Look at this shit.

340
00:22:18,462 --> 00:22:21,381
幸好你長得漂亮 You're lucky you're pretty. You know that, right?

341
00:22:22,591 --> 00:22:24,301
這個上面寫了啥 What does that one say?

342
00:22:24,384 --> 00:22:28,847
"伊恩"  以防萬一他來了  我真傻 "Ian." In case he shows up today. Stupid.

343
00:22:29,848 --> 00:22:31,434
媽逼 Shit.

344
00:22:36,396 --> 00:22:38,566
真高興我們是一家人 I'm so glad we're family.

345
00:22:55,499 --> 00:22:59,252
-情人節快樂  -謝謝 - Happy Valentine's Day. - Thanks.

346
00:23:01,672 --> 00:23:05,050
今天有給我做什么愛心晚餐嗎 Are you cooking up something special for me today?

347
00:23:05,133 --> 00:23:06,969
屋子里聞著真香 The house smells great.

348
00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:09,454
這就是你想要我做的嗎 That's what you're gonna expect me to do? 

349
00:23:09,455 --> 00:23:11,682
給你做飯  當你的家庭主婦 Cook for you? Be your little housewife?

350
00:23:11,765 --> 00:23:12,850
別想了  不可能 It's not happening.

351
00:23:12,933 --> 00:23:16,269
沒有  我以為我們是在扮演... No. I thought we were playing the...

352
00:23:16,353 --> 00:23:17,771
我無所謂你煮不煮飯 I don't care if you cook.

353
00:23:18,772 --> 00:23:21,358
抱歉  我今天心情不太好 Sorry. I've just been depressed today.

354
00:23:22,442 --> 00:23:25,070
不想再玩裝正常的游戲了 I don't want to play the normal game anymore

355
00:23:25,153 --> 00:23:27,990
因為我們永遠不可能像正常情侶那樣 'cause I don't know how we ever are gonna be normal.

356
00:23:33,579 --> 00:23:35,831
就是想告訴你  如果你想找人說說話 Well, just so you know. Counselors can be a great resource

357
00:23:35,914 --> 00:23:38,792
或哭一場  你可以找輔導員 if you feel like you need to talk or cry or something.

358
00:23:38,876 --> 00:23:40,210
-誰是你輔導員  -海利 - Who'd you get? - Healy.

359
00:23:40,293 --> 00:23:41,294
這樣 Oh.

360
00:23:41,378 --> 00:23:43,380
-有什么不對嗎  -沒有 - What's wrong? - Nothing.

361
00:23:43,463 --> 00:23:46,258
我只是覺得沒有哪個姑娘真心喜歡他 I just get the sense that none of the girls really like him.

362
00:23:46,341 --> 00:23:48,301
但你很堅強  都會過去的 But you're tough, you'll be fine.

363
00:23:50,387 --> 00:23:55,225
你有沒有覺得最近我們燒斷了很多保險絲 Have you noticed we've been blowing a lot of fuses around here lately?

364
00:23:55,308 --> 00:23:57,060
你才發現這兒都快散架了嗎 You're just noticing this place is falling apart?

365
00:23:57,144 --> 00:24:00,105
監獄難道沒有基礎設施的預算嗎 Doesn't the prison have a budget for infrastructure?

366
00:24:00,188 --> 00:24:01,439
當然有 Sure.

367
00:24:01,524 --> 00:24:05,485
那上個季度的電器預算哪去了 And what happened to the electrical budget from last quarter?

368
00:24:05,569 --> 00:24:09,573
說是要加護A區柵欄和卸貨平臺 It went to "upgrading the A block grid and loading dock panel."

369
00:24:09,657 --> 00:24:11,033
真的嗎  我們真加護了 Really? We did that?

370
00:24:11,116 --> 00:24:12,492
預算報告是這么寫的 That's what the budget report says.

371
00:24:12,576 --> 00:24:14,578
-那我們做了嗎  -這個嘛 - So we did it? - Okay.

372
00:24:14,662 --> 00:24:16,079
-真加護了嗎  -不然呢 - So it happened? - Why not?

373
00:24:16,163 --> 00:24:18,081
我不明白 I don't understand.

374
00:24:18,165 --> 00:24:20,500
相信我  你不想懂的 Trust me. You don't want to.

375
00:24:20,584 --> 00:24:25,923
好了  時間到了  恭喜你剛掙了11分 Congratulations. Hour's up. You just earned another 11 cents.

376
00:24:30,678 --> 00:24:34,807
好  各位  海豚式 All right, everybody. Dolphin pose.

377
00:24:42,856 --> 00:24:44,942
我覺得我能幫你完成這個海豚式 You know, I think I can help you with the dolphin pose.

378
00:24:45,025 --> 00:24:47,360
關鍵就在于保證你的骨盆放在... The trick is to make sure that your pelvic basin is just right...

379
00:24:47,444 --> 00:24:48,862
離我遠點 Get away from me.

380
00:25:03,711 --> 00:25:06,714
我去  謝謝紅媽 No way! Thanks, Red.

381
00:25:11,719 --> 00:25:15,347
紅媽  上帝保佑你 Red! Bless you!

382
00:25:19,727 --> 00:25:23,313
現在  再做一次海豚式 Now, let's return to dolphin pose.

383
00:25:26,274 --> 00:25:27,400
莖茶 Kukicha tea.

384
00:25:30,654 --> 00:25:32,030
看看誰回來了 Well, look who's back.

385
00:25:36,118 --> 00:25:40,247
無意打擾  姑娘們  繼續你們的海豚吧 Sorry to interrupt, girls. Continue with your dolphins.

386
00:25:44,459 --> 00:25:47,212
操  剛搞了個4分的 Fuck, just bagged a four-pointer.

387
00:25:52,843 --> 00:25:54,928
我們差不多平手 We're almost tied.

388
00:25:59,099 --> 00:26:00,100
聽著 Listen up.

389
00:26:01,101 --> 00:26:03,603
不要再毫無意義地賭氣了 This angry nonsense has to stop.

390
00:26:05,355 --> 00:26:08,066
很快我們就需要互相幫助 We're going to need each other soon.

391
00:26:08,150 --> 00:26:09,567
所有人 All of us.

392
00:26:24,667 --> 00:26:26,043
我沒開玩笑  尼古拉斯 I'm not kidding, Nicky.

393
00:26:27,169 --> 00:26:30,839
我們必須團結一致  這樣才能更強大 We have to stick together. We're stronger together.

394
00:26:32,132 --> 00:26:33,967
所以你就想再收買她們 So you try to buy their love back?

395
00:26:35,761 --> 00:26:37,387
謝謝紅媽 Thanks, Red.

396
00:26:47,022 --> 00:26:49,399
干嘛要問我 Why are you asking me that?

397
00:26:50,525 --> 00:26:54,988
你不該和我說話  你不該... You shouldn't be talking to me. So... You shouldn't be...

398
00:26:56,907 --> 00:26:59,785
-14罐護足粉  -有了 - Fourteen foot powders. - Check.

399
00:26:59,868 --> 00:27:02,788
-20管牙膏  -有了 - Twenty Effergrips. - Check that.

400
00:27:02,871 --> 00:27:05,165
還記得我們賣煙那會兒么 Remember when we sold smokes?

401
00:27:05,248 --> 00:27:07,667
我發誓我再也不投給自由黨了 God, I swear I'm gonna vote Libertarian.

402
00:27:07,751 --> 00:27:10,628
我得去趟車里  等會兒就回來 I gotta run to my car. I'll be right back.

403
00:27:17,135 --> 00:27:18,428
我能出去一會兒么 Mind if I step out for a moment?

404
00:27:18,511 --> 00:27:20,263
我他媽才不管呢 I don't give a shit.

405
00:27:26,686 --> 00:27:27,980
我猜猜 Let me guess.

406
00:27:28,063 --> 00:27:33,693
"維  你把美味姐弄去保管處我很不爽" "Yo, Vee, I'm just so mad since y'all got Taystee transferred to custodial.

407
00:27:33,777 --> 00:27:37,572
"這樣我只能一個人在圖書館玩兒奶了" "Just left me in the library with my titties in my hand."

408
00:27:39,074 --> 00:27:40,075
猜對了嗎 Close?

409
00:27:40,826 --> 00:27:41,425
你漏了一句 No, you left out, 

410
00:27:41,426 --> 00:27:43,703
"要是你害她惹麻煩  我就殺了你" "If you get her in trouble, I'll kill you."

411
00:27:46,414 --> 00:27:48,083
-真的  -你試試 - Really? - Bet.

412
00:27:49,584 --> 00:27:51,962
-你要怎么殺我呢  -我會想到辦法的 - And how would you kill me? - I'll figure it out.

413
00:27:53,546 --> 00:27:57,384
我知道她覺得自己欠了你  可我明白 I know she thinks she owes you, but from what I heard,

414
00:27:58,718 --> 00:28:02,514
你不過是個利用迷途小孩  只顧自己的惡霸 you're just a bully who uses lost kids for her own shit

415
00:28:02,597 --> 00:28:05,100
等他們沒用了就扔到一邊 and then dumps 'em soon as the heat comes down.

416
00:28:05,183 --> 00:28:06,393
你他媽就是個吸血鬼 You're a fucking vampire.

417
00:28:07,435 --> 00:28:11,231
曾經有個小孩  叫哈羅·瓊斯 There was this kid growing up. Name was Haro Jones.

418
00:28:13,942 --> 00:28:16,319
他那雙手臂啊  我喜歡得... He had these arms. I just wanted to...

419
00:28:17,570 --> 00:28:21,366
只想從上舔到下... lick the length of his arms.

420
00:28:21,449 --> 00:28:24,119
有一天我在公園里 And then one day I walked into the park.

421
00:28:25,829 --> 00:28:28,456
看見他手伸進杰米拉·拉金的裙子里 Found his hand up Jamela Larkin's skirt.

422
00:28:29,582 --> 00:28:30,750
真是傷透了我的心 Broke my poor fool heart.

423
00:28:30,834 --> 00:28:33,420
聽著女人  我他媽才不管你過去的故事... Look, lady, I don't give a fuck about your little stories and shit...

424
00:28:33,503 --> 00:28:34,587
美味姐... Taystee...

425
00:28:36,131 --> 00:28:37,132

你 you.

429
00:28:44,139 --> 00:28:46,349
她永遠不會喜歡你 She will never love you.

430
00:28:48,185 --> 00:28:49,770
不是你想要的那種 Not the way you want.

431
00:28:56,609 --> 00:28:58,653
我不需要她喜歡我 Yo, I don't want her like that.

432
00:28:59,988 --> 00:29:03,784
我只想照顧她  僅此而已 I'm just looking out for her. That's all.

433
00:29:21,969 --> 00:29:27,015
爸爸  他媽幾個中國兵在我窗外抽煙來著 Yo, Pops, some fucking Chinese soldiers was just smoking right outside my window.

434
00:29:31,353 --> 00:29:32,813
抱歉 I'm so sorry.

435
00:29:32,896 --> 00:29:34,731
怎么了  媽媽呢 What? Where's Mom?

436
00:29:34,815 --> 00:29:35,899
她沒事 She's fine.

437
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:39,069
我們被調回美國了 We're being transferred back to the States.

438
00:29:39,152 --> 00:29:42,072
我也不知道為什么  但已經定了 I don't know why, but we are.

439
00:29:44,825 --> 00:29:45,993
什么 What?

440
00:29:46,076 --> 00:29:47,410
抱歉 Sorry.

441
00:29:49,037 --> 00:29:50,956
讓你失望了  珀比 I let you both down, P.

442
00:29:54,042 --> 00:29:56,086
我也不知該說什么好 I don't know what to say.

443
00:30:11,894 --> 00:30:13,145
在這兒了 All right.

444
00:30:22,863 --> 00:30:25,866
天哪... Jesus! The...

445
00:30:39,087 --> 00:30:40,380
你越界了  查普曼 You're out of bounds, Chapman.

446
00:30:41,882 --> 00:30:44,885
你不說出去  我就不說 Well, I won't tell if you don't.

447
00:30:48,430 --> 00:30:49,806
把我們當犯人一樣對待 Treating us like we're prisoners.

448
00:30:52,059 --> 00:30:57,522
我聽說這里曾經想建個體育館 Hey, you know, I heard that there were plans to build a gym here.

449
00:30:57,605 --> 00:30:59,232
你知道后來怎么樣了嗎 Do you know whatever happened to that?

450
00:30:59,316 --> 00:31:00,400
還不是老樣子 What always happens.

451
00:31:01,401 --> 00:31:02,986
我來接手吧 I'll take it from here.

452
00:31:07,115 --> 00:31:08,909
就是找一根出問題的電線 Just looking for a faulty wire.

453
00:31:08,992 --> 00:31:11,244
為什么要問麥克斯韋體育館的事 Why are you asking Maxwell about a gym?

454
00:31:12,287 --> 00:31:15,040
聽說最近你的問題有點多啊 From what I hear, you're full of questions lately.

455
00:31:15,123 --> 00:31:16,874
你知道的  我一直很關心 You know that I have always been interested

456
00:31:16,959 --> 00:31:19,044
他人的安全與健康 in the health and safety of others.

457
00:31:20,128 --> 00:31:22,172
我還努力幫你去看你奶奶 I'm trying to help you with your nana.

458
00:31:22,255 --> 00:31:25,592
所以我再問一遍  為什么你問這些問題 So again, why are you asking all these questions?

459
00:31:34,434 --> 00:31:37,187
"新聞自由權并非只有自由人才有" "Freedom of the press shouldn't only be a privilege of the free."

460
00:31:38,771 --> 00:31:41,441
這他媽扯什么犢子 What the fuck does that mean?

461
00:31:41,524 --> 00:31:43,651
關新聞什么事 What does the press have anything to do with this?

462
00:31:46,989 --> 00:31:49,074
我想開辦一份監獄簡報 I'm starting a prison newsletter.

463
00:31:49,157 --> 00:31:50,951
-一份簡報  -對 - A newsletter? - A newsletter.

464
00:31:52,035 --> 00:31:55,247
一份...由犯人撰寫的...簡報 A newsletter... written by the prisoners...

465
00:31:55,330 --> 00:32:01,003
由文章和專欄組成 with articles and op-ed pieces.

466
00:32:01,086 --> 00:32:02,879
所以我試著走出自己的世界 That is why I've been trying to get out of my bubble

467
00:32:02,963 --> 00:32:04,672
開始了解這個地方 and get to know this place.

468
00:32:04,756 --> 00:32:07,800
我們...這里是我們的家 We... This is our home.

469
00:32:09,469 --> 00:32:12,014
我們應該加強彼此之間的交流 We should all be communicating more.

470
00:32:12,097 --> 00:32:16,184
犯人啊  守衛啊  管理人員 Inmates, guards, administration.

471
00:32:16,268 --> 00:32:18,520
這份簡報可以幫助 This could really,

472
00:32:18,603 --> 00:32:24,651
我們更了解彼此  了解這里 really help us get to know each other and this place better.

473
00:32:27,362 --> 00:32:30,907
當然需要您的同意 Pending your approval, of course,

474
00:32:33,076 --> 00:32:37,080
主編大人 Mr. Editor-in-Chief.

475
00:32:37,164 --> 00:32:38,415
別捧過頭了 Don't oversell it.

476
00:32:45,213 --> 00:32:46,756
-一份簡報  -對 - A newsletter? - Mmm.

477
00:32:48,425 --> 00:32:51,094
好吧  不是說我同意了 Okay. I'm not saying yes.

478
00:32:52,512 --> 00:32:54,597
明天給我幾篇例文看看 Show me some sample stories by tomorrow.

481
00:33:05,192 --> 00:33:06,984
她們還會喜歡你的 They will again.

482
00:33:10,197 --> 00:33:12,574
我的姑娘們都怎么樣 Hey, hey, hey. How my girls doing?

483
00:33:19,539 --> 00:33:21,916
怎么又板起臉了 Why you got your famous pouty face on?

484
00:33:23,210 --> 00:33:24,877
我不明白你在干嘛 I don't understand what you doing.

485
00:33:24,961 --> 00:33:27,004
是嗎  有多少次你都不理解我在干嘛 Yeah? And how many times have you not understood my methods

486
00:33:27,089 --> 00:33:29,341
最終不都搞懂了 only to have everything be made clear?

487
00:33:29,424 --> 00:33:31,634
是嗎  那警察追RJ那次呢 Yeah, like when the cops were after RJ?

488
00:33:31,718 --> 00:33:35,722
這么早就放大招了 God damn! You done gone for the nuclear option early.

489
00:33:35,805 --> 00:33:37,974
為什么你不愿意談RJ Why don't you ever wanna talk about RJ?

490
00:33:38,058 --> 00:33:39,533
因為都過去了  姑娘 Because it's in the past, girl. 

491
00:33:39,534 --> 00:33:41,894
而我活在現在  你也應該這樣 I live in the now. So should you.

你只是想證明你還能使喚我 You just wanna prove that you can order me around.

艾·沃

506
00:34:41,288 --> 00:34:43,581
就好像是踏進浴缸 Okay, it's like getting into a bath,

507
00:34:43,665 --> 00:34:47,294

00:35:00,014 --> 00:35:02,684
她說的沒錯  你還有個披薩 She's right. And you also have a pizza.

513
00:35:08,815 --> 00:35:11,818
我從那個有胡子的希臘妞那兒弄了點私酒 Hey, I got some hooch from that Greek chick with the beard.

514
00:35:16,489 --> 00:35:19,033

讓這些姑娘開什么派對 Let 'em have their stupid little party 

520
00:35:31,868 --> 00:35:33,798
又不留足夠人手管理 and then don't put enough muscle on.

521
00:35:33,881 --> 00:35:35,425
太典型了 So typical.

布羅尼科斯基  控制著點 Bronikowski, leave room for Jesus.

523
00:35:38,052 --> 00:35:40,972
不然我分分鐘就關了派對 I will shut this thing down in a heartbeat.

我告訴你  本尼特 I'll tell you something about women, Bennett.

528
00:35:55,111 --> 00:35:58,114
女人啊  你要讓她們覺得你投入了很多感情 With women, you make 'em think you're meeting them halfway,

529
00:35:58,198 --> 00:35:59,866
可實際上呢 when really what you're doing is

530
00:35:59,949 --> 00:36:03,245
你只投入了10%到15% you're meeting them about 10% to 15% of the way.

531
00:36:04,704 --> 00:36:08,625
女人數學都不好  記住這點 Women are really bad at math. Don't forget that.

那我和你一起走 Then I'm coming with you.

556
00:38:32,184 --> 00:38:34,020
你不會喜歡新澤西的 Don't think Jersey's for you.

557

你的奶子真心不錯  我會記住的 You have killer tits. I'll remember those.

563

00:38:56,376 --> 00:38:58,210
我是老手了 I've had a lot of practice.

566
00:39:15,061 --> 00:39:17,480
真是意想不到的驚喜 Well, that was unexpected.

567
00:39:17,564 --> 00:39:20,817
抱歉我之前心情不好 Sorry. I was in a mood before.

568
00:39:23,570 --> 00:39:25,613
你真貼心 You're the sweetest man.

569
00:39:27,615 --> 00:39:28,658

570
00:39:36,916 --> 00:39:38,334
還有條狗 Look at the dog!

571
00:39:40,294 --> 00:39:41,879

572
00:39:43,590 --> 00:39:45,174

00:39:45,257 --> 00:39:47,259
這個 Mmm. This.

574
00:39:51,556 --> 00:39:53,433
干嘛偷偷摸摸的 Sneaky, sneaky man.

575
00:39:54,864 --> 00:39:56,664
致我的愛人

576
00:39:56,860 --> 00:40:00,676
情人節快樂  那對小孩就是我們  情人節快樂  馬上就能快樂  你知道我是誰

577
00:39:58,395 --> 00:40:00,860
你看  我們也能成為普通情侶 See? We can be a normal couple. 

578
00:40:00,861 --> 00:40:03,150
不過你把"情"字寫錯了 Except you misspelled "Valentine's."

579
00:40:05,612 --> 00:40:06,821
不  我不會 No, I didn't.

580
00:40:08,573 --> 00:40:10,450
是門德斯寫的 Mendez did.

581
00:40:25,131 --> 00:40:26,132
你們好 Hi.

582
00:40:28,635 --> 00:40:30,887
我們準備創辦一份簡報 I was wondering if I could ask you a few questions

583
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:32,597
所以能問你們幾個問題嗎 for a newsletter we're starting.

584
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:36,643
辦簡報  祝你們好運 A newsletter? Okay, good luck.

585
00:40:36,726 --> 00:40:40,813
你看  今天是情人節 So, since it's Valentine's Day,

586
00:40:42,148 --> 00:40:44,066
你覺得愛是什么 what is love to you?

587
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:45,735
你們怎么定義愛 How would you define love?

588
00:40:45,818 --> 00:40:48,279
這問題真他媽蠢 That's a retarded fucking question.

589
00:40:49,989 --> 00:40:51,658
好吧 Okay. Um...

590
00:40:53,576 --> 00:40:54,952
換個問題 How about this?

591
00:40:56,162 --> 00:40:57,539
上一次你們見到 When was the last time

592
00:40:57,622 --> 00:41:00,958
大規模的水管修繕是什么時候 you saw any major plumbing work being done around here?

593
00:41:02,168 --> 00:41:03,545
我想想 Hmm.

594
00:41:03,628 --> 00:41:07,924
-大概04  05年吧  -04  05年 - '04-'05, maybe? - '04-'05.

595
00:41:08,007 --> 00:41:12,679
有個叫唐娜·庫索的胖妞一周內弄壞了三個馬桶 This fatso named Donna Cusio broke three toilets in one week.

596
00:41:13,930 --> 00:41:16,307
真他媽一團糟啊 It was a mess, man.

597
00:41:20,853 --> 00:41:24,524
我想也是  太肥了肯定 I bet. Big, big woman.

598
00:41:31,072 --> 00:41:33,616
我是卡佳  請留言 This is Katya. Leave a message.

599
00:41:36,368 --> 00:41:37,954
寶貝 Hi, honey.

600
00:41:38,705 --> 00:41:39,706
是我 It's me.

601
00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:45,878
我打來就是想祝你情人節快樂 I just wanted to call and wish you a happy Valentine's Day.

602
00:41:49,549 --> 00:41:51,133
你愿意 Would you like...

603
00:41:51,508 --> 00:41:52,552
和我 to dance...

604
00:41:53,052 --> 00:41:54,345
跳支舞嗎 with me?

605
00:41:59,934 --> 00:42:01,728
我是為你學的 I learned that for you.

606
00:42:04,021 --> 00:42:08,275
我是一個好男人  卡佳  你會明白的 I'm a good man, Katya. You'll see that.

607
00:42:10,027 --> 00:42:14,490
我一定會讓你自豪能嫁給我這個傻蛋 I'm gonna make you really proud to be married to this big galoot.

608
00:42:15,867 --> 00:42:17,368
我發誓 I swear to...

609
00:42:32,008 --> 00:42:33,676
什么叫菲利斯不存在 The fuck you mean there's no Ferris?

610
00:42:32,008 --> 00:42:33,676
說的是《春天不是讀書天》的情節

611
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:35,511
聽我說 No, okay. Hear me out.

612
00:42:35,595 --> 00:42:37,179
菲利斯只是 Ferris is just a projection

613
00:42:37,263 --> 00:42:40,933
卡梅隆假想出來的  表現他不敢反抗專橫的爸爸 of Cameron's inability to stand up to his domineering father.

614
00:42:41,017 --> 00:42:45,521
但問題就在這里  卡梅隆根本沒離開過房間 But here's the mind-fuck. Cameron never actually leaves his room!

615
00:42:45,605 --> 00:42:46,606
記得嗎  他病了 Remember, he's sick.

616
00:42:46,689 --> 00:42:49,742
于是他想象出一個理想化的自己  菲利斯 He invents this idealized self, Ferris. 

617
00:42:49,743 --> 00:42:52,153
還給他弄了個三十歲的女朋友 Plus his, like, 30-year-old girlfriend.

618
00:42:52,236 --> 00:42:54,363
然后想象出了之后一系列的冒險 And then imagines this epic adventure

619
00:42:54,446 --> 00:42:57,867
追車  游行  打球等等 with car chases, parades, ball games, blah, blah, blah.

620
00:42:57,950 --> 00:42:59,201
所以逃學的一天 So this day off

621
00:42:59,285 --> 00:43:02,371
只是他身體與意識的脫離... is actually just the day off from his rigid coherence to mind-body alignment...

622
00:43:02,454 --> 00:43:04,957
你他媽就不能給我閉嘴嗎 Would you please shut the fuck up?

623
00:43:06,959 --> 00:43:09,796
抱歉  只是我看的一個理論而已 Sorry. It's just a theory I read.

624
00:43:12,799 --> 00:43:15,342
下次直接坐她臉上  她就閉嘴了 Next time, just sit on her face. It shuts her right up.

625
00:43:15,426 --> 00:43:17,845
我會記住的 I'll keep that in mind.

626
00:43:33,986 --> 00:43:35,071
為什么故意不理我 Why are you ignoring me?

627
00:43:37,573 --> 00:43:40,492
為什么不理我  說啊 Why are you ignoring me? Spit it out! Come on!

628
00:43:40,576 --> 00:43:42,912
你之前一直獨裁這個小團體 Look, you've been lording over this group 

629
00:43:42,913 --> 00:43:44,664
就跟希拉里一樣 like some Hillary Clinton dictator.

630
00:43:44,747 --> 00:43:46,165
-什么  -可我們想要民主 - What? - And we wanna be a democracy.

631
00:43:46,248 --> 00:43:47,834
你說我是希拉里·克林頓 Are you calling me Hillary Clinton?

632
00:43:48,668 --> 00:43:50,294
要是你也穿得下褲套裝 If the pantsuit fits.

633
00:43:51,628 --> 00:43:53,589
聽著  我們不帶你玩了 Look, we're done with you. Right?

634
00:43:54,506 --> 00:43:56,133
你們不帶我了 Y'all are done with me?

635
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:00,304
真是搞笑啊  琳恩 That's really funny. That's really funny, Leanne.

636
00:44:00,387 --> 00:44:02,514
如果我是希拉里 'Cause if I'm Hillary Clinton,

637
00:44:02,598 --> 00:44:06,518
那你們就是賤人  毒鬼  只知道喝思樂冰 then y'all must be some sister-wife, tweaker, Slurpee-drinking,

638
00:44:06,602 --> 00:44:12,066
沒文化  沒爹的拖車癟三 fourth-grade reading level, Daddy-on-COPS, trailer trash nothing!

639
00:44:13,609 --> 00:44:14,610
你們知道嗎  我無所謂 And you know what? It's okay

640
00:44:14,694 --> 00:44:16,863
因為你們從來對我都不算什么 'cause you ain't never even challenged me anyway.

641
00:44:16,946 --> 00:44:19,531
其實  你們誰都不行 Actually, you know what? None of you did. Not one.

642
00:44:19,615 --> 00:44:22,201
你老是和比你差的人打網球 You keep playing tennis with someone worse than you

643
00:44:22,284 --> 00:44:25,037
你就永遠打不好  所以謝謝 and you ain't never gonna get better. So thank you.

644
00:44:25,121 --> 00:44:28,207
-你還打網球  -這是比喻  你個傻逼 - You play tennis? - It's a metaphor, you potato with eyes!

645
00:44:30,459 --> 00:44:34,213
不好意思要說臟話了  你們吃屎去吧 You know what? Pardon my French, but you can eat my shit.

646
00:44:34,296 --> 00:44:35,297
婊子 Whore.

647
00:44:35,381 --> 00:44:36,799
婊子  婊子 Whore. Whore.

648
00:44:40,052 --> 00:44:42,221
剛才可真尷尬 Man, that was awkward.

649
00:44:44,723 --> 00:44:46,392
-安琪  -嗯 - Angie? - Yeah?

650
00:44:46,475 --> 00:44:48,144
給我拿點飲料 Go get me some punch.

651
00:45:11,793 --> 00:45:12,960
派對不錯 Great party.

652
00:45:14,003 --> 00:45:16,505
聽著  我們很高興 Listen, we are so happy

653
00:45:16,588 --> 00:45:22,344
你和達婭有如此美好秘密的特殊時光 that you and Daya are having such fun, special, secret times together.

654
00:45:22,428 --> 00:45:25,347
我們也很欣賞你對她這么好 And we really admire you providing for her so well.

655
00:45:25,431 --> 00:45:27,183
盡管是這種情況 You know, despite the circumstances.

656
00:45:27,266 --> 00:45:28,767
我們只想讓你知道 And we just wanted to let you know

657
00:45:28,851 --> 00:45:32,604
我們將以沉默來表達對你的完全支持 that we support you 500% with our continued silence.

658
00:45:32,688 --> 00:45:36,150
鑒于如此  下次你再夾帶私貨進來時 Considering as such, in your next round of leg-based contraband,

659
00:45:36,233 --> 00:45:37,526
我們有幾個要求 we had a couple requests

660
00:45:37,609 --> 00:45:40,612
這樣我們能更愉快地保持沉默 that could make our aforementioned silence a little bit more comfortable.

661
00:45:40,696 --> 00:45:43,908
我呢  想要一個iPod隨身聽 I mean, I, personally, request an iPod Shuffle.

你告訴別人我有陰虱 You told people I have crabs.

671
00:46:09,976 --> 00:46:12,436
你才發現啊 You just found out about that?

672
00:46:12,519 --> 00:46:13,520
你這是作弊 It is cheating!

673

沒事  羅瑞格茲在波士頓被砸時也沒哭啊 Come on. A-Rod doesn't cry when he gets plunked in Beantown.

674
00:46:17,191 --> 00:46:19,068
他還不是撐住了  去盜二壘 He sucks it up and tries to steal second.

675

我也想舔舔  上二壘啊 I've been trying to both suck and steal second,

676
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:23,280
要是大家都覺得我有陰虱我還怎么上啊 but I can't because everybody thinks I have cooties!

677
00:46:24,866 --> 00:46:27,743

Thirty-six.

-感覺怎么樣  -很粗糙 - And? - It was gnarly.

683
00:46:39,421 --> 00:46:40,839
陰蒂好大 It's macroclit.

684
00:46:40,923 --> 00:46:43,134
-就像給小孩口活似的  -我的天 - It was like blowing a toddler. - Oh, my God!

692
00:47:05,614 --> 00:47:07,658
因為我無比好勝 Because I am insanely competitive.

693

704
00:48:00,586 --> 00:48:03,630
-我不知道你要來  -我說了這應該挺好玩的 - I didn't know you were coming. - You heard me say it sounded fun.

705
00:48:03,714 --> 00:48:06,092
希望你不介意我跟別人提了你的演出 I hope you don't mind I told some of the guys about your show.

706
00:48:06,175 --> 00:48:07,301
我差點趕不過來 I almost didn't make it.

707
00:48:07,384 --> 00:48:09,274
現在賣方不肯劃掉 Get this, the sellers are now refusing to drop 

708
00:48:09,275 --> 00:48:10,929
突發置換這一項 the replacement contingency!

709
00:48:11,013 --> 00:48:12,556
你他媽能別提房子的事兒了嗎 Would you shut up about real estate?

710
00:48:12,639 --> 00:48:14,808
我當初要你搬進來你不肯 I asked you to move in with me and you said no.

711
00:48:14,891 --> 00:48:17,644
所以你現在沒資格說話 So you have no talking rights here.

712
00:48:18,645 --> 00:48:21,232
不錯  像雙重約會 This is nice. Like a double date!

713
00:48:21,315 --> 00:48:23,400
-我們不是一對  -我們不是一對 - We're not together. - We're not together.

714
00:48:23,484 --> 00:48:24,901
我們還需要一把椅子 Actually we're gonna need another chair.

715
00:48:25,902 --> 00:48:27,363
為什么 Why?

716
00:48:31,950 --> 00:48:33,910
你看著像基佬 You look like the Gay Edge.

717
00:48:38,790 --> 00:48:40,542
你好啊 Hey!

718
00:48:45,952 --> 00:48:47,637
留位

719
00:48:53,639 --> 00:48:58,394

不管是誰  他包容你的一切 whoever, they chose to take all that on.

722
00:49:15,702 --> 00:49:17,371
所有奇奇怪怪的方面 All that weird stuff.

723
00:49:17,454 --> 00:49:21,917
無論是不好的還是隱藏的特質 Whatever's wrong or bad or hiding in you.

724
00:49:22,918 --> 00:49:25,171
突然都沒關系了 Suddenly it's all right.

725
00:49:26,505 --> 00:49:29,216
你不再覺得自己是個怪胎了 You don't feel like such a freak anymore.

726
00:49:32,010 --> 00:49:33,220
萊瑞 Larry!

727
00:49:34,846 --> 00:49:36,932
月亮敢這樣嗎 Would the moon do this?

728
00:49:43,564 --> 00:49:44,773
我贏了 I won!

729
00:49:47,318 --> 00:49:49,445
萊瑞  很高興見到你 Larry! Good to see you, mate.

730
00:49:50,696 --> 00:49:52,614
身上有些味道抱歉  剛宰了頭鹿 Sorry about the stink. I killed a caribou!

731
00:49:52,698 --> 00:49:54,783
腌在菠蘿汁里野味就能淡點 Less gamey marinated in pineapple juice.

732
00:49:54,866 --> 00:49:56,993
還讓精液更美味 Also, makes your spunk taste good.

733
00:49:57,078 --> 00:50:00,789
所以寶貝你有福了  這是什么 So you're in luck, babe! What's that?

734
00:50:00,872 --> 00:50:02,124
這是... Oh. It's, uh...

735
00:50:02,208 --> 00:50:04,460
是帕波的東西 It's Piper's stuff.

736
00:50:04,543 --> 00:50:07,754
哥們  一起吧  我們正要出去吃點拉面 Aw. Brother. Come on, we were just heading out for some ramen.

737
00:50:07,838 --> 00:50:10,048
現在有保姆能偷點閑  東西讓門童看著 You know, we have a babysitter! I'll leave these with the doorman.

738
00:50:10,132 --> 00:50:11,883
不用了  皮特  我得... No, Pete. Really, I should... I...

739
00:50:11,967 --> 00:50:15,011
這可是情人節啊  混蛋  一起來 It's Valentine's Day, asshole! Come join us.

740
00:50:38,285 --> 00:50:41,622
我在你垃圾桶里找到這個 I found this in your trash.

741
00:50:41,705 --> 00:50:43,081
這是... And this is...

742
00:50:47,503 --> 00:50:49,838
你一直提起的那個人 the guy you always talking about?

743
00:50:53,091 --> 00:50:55,886
我知道愛一個 Yeah, I know something about loving people

744
00:50:55,969 --> 00:50:58,430
不知回報的人的滋味 who aren't smart enough to wanna be loved back.

745
00:50:59,973 --> 00:51:02,309
但我知道個秘密  我告訴你 But I learned a secret that I can tell you.

746
00:51:02,393 --> 00:51:03,727
他們都不值得愛 They don't deserve it.

747
00:51:08,774 --> 00:51:11,443
他永久地毀了我的這個節日 He's ruined this day for me forever.

748
00:51:11,527 --> 00:51:14,070
大家都不知道我們不在一起了 Nobody knows that we're not together.

749
00:51:14,155 --> 00:51:16,990
可是你知道啊 Yeah, but you do.

你知道最瘋狂的是什么嗎 You know what is crazy?

752
00:51:35,717 --> 00:51:38,762
就是經歷了這一切一切 I still wanna believe in all of this stuff.

753
00:51:39,596 --> 00:51:42,391
我還愿意相信這些東西 Even after everything that's happened.

754
00:51:44,059 --> 00:51:46,478
-是不是很可悲  -不不 - Isn't that sad? - Oh, no.

755
00:51:47,854 --> 00:51:50,065
我覺得這是勇敢 I think that's brave.

756
00:51:51,567 --> 00:51:52,693
謝謝 Thank you.

757
00:52:07,499 --> 00:52:12,087
說真的  你覺得我該隆胸嗎 Seriously. Do you think I should get fake tits?

758
00:52:14,590 --> 00:52:16,758
是的 Yeah. Probably.

759
00:52:20,924 --> 00:52:23,737
伊恩

760
00:52:25,100 --> 00:52:26,518
混蛋 Asshole.

761
00:52:30,356 --> 00:52:31,815
你知道我最難過什么嗎 You know what gets me?

762
00:52:33,024 --> 00:52:37,488
我們在這里浪費了最美好的年華 We're wasting the best years of our lives in here.

763
00:52:37,571 --> 00:52:40,866
我們的胸不會比現在更美 Like, our tits are never gonna look better.

764
00:52:40,949 --> 00:52:44,411
我們的翹臀也不會比現在更美 Our asses are never gonna look better.

765
00:52:44,495 --> 00:52:48,999
沒人上我  沒人吻我 You know, no one's touching my ass. No one's kissing my lips.

766
00:52:50,251 --> 00:52:55,046
傻瓜  我來吻你 Shit. I'll kiss your dumb lips.

767
00:53:02,220 --> 00:53:03,389
再來一次 Do it again.

768
00:53:23,575 --> 00:53:26,287
-不行  -不行不行 - No! - No! No.

沒事的 It's okay.

772
00:53:54,773 --> 00:53:58,234
珀比  過來給她們看看什么才是真正的鬼步舞 Yo, P. Come and show these fools how to cabbage patch for real.

773
00:53:58,319 --> 00:53:59,611
不用了 Nah. I'm good.

774
00:53:59,695 --> 00:54:01,196
別裝得什么事都沒有一樣 Man, don't act like everything fine. Like this...

775
00:54:01,279 --> 00:54:02,989
行了  你吃千層面 Yo. I don't interrupt you

776
00:54:03,073 --> 00:54:05,492
吃得正爽的時候我也沒打攪過你啊 when you going to town on a bunch of spaghetti. Damn!

777
00:54:06,368 --> 00:54:09,371
回你那維媽身邊去好了 Yo, why don't you head on back to old Erykah Badu over there?

778
00:54:10,956 --> 00:54:12,666
我就當沒聽見這句 I'm gonna forget you said that.

779
00:54:12,749 --> 00:54:15,877
我又不在乎你聽沒聽見 I don't give a fuck what you forget or remember!

780
00:54:16,962 --> 00:54:20,215
媽逼這下好了  多謝啊 Oh, shit. Great! Thanks a lot, man.

781
00:54:25,387 --> 00:54:26,388
你走開 You should leave.

782
00:54:26,597 --> 00:54:27,639
珀比 Poussey!

783
00:54:27,723 --> 00:54:30,308

00:54:30,601 --> 00:54:31,852

787
00:54:38,316 --> 00:54:42,654

788
00:54:43,655 --> 00:54:44,656
喝酒了吧  孩子 Been drinking, little girl?

789
00:54:44,740 --> 00:54:45,782
珀比  別這樣 Poussey, please.

790
00:54:45,866 --> 00:54:48,702
你無權決定我的生活 You don't get to decide what happens to my life!

791
00:54:49,745 --> 00:54:51,372
你沒這個權利 Not you!

792
00:54:51,455 --> 00:54:52,498
我愛她 I love her.

793
00:54:56,334 --> 00:54:58,670
所以你必須回家 And that is why you're going home.

794
00:55:02,048 --> 00:55:04,551
我受夠了  我哪兒都不去 I'm done. I'm not going anywhere.

795
00:55:10,599 --> 00:55:12,726
抱歉  中校 Pardon us, Oberstleutnant.

796
00:55:14,520 --> 00:55:16,146
請繼續享用冰激凌 Enjoy your ice cream.

797
00:55:16,229 --> 00:55:17,898
你知道嗎  現在有些治療項目 You know, there are programs

798
00:55:17,981 --> 00:55:22,611
可以糾正你女兒有問題的取向 that can change your daughter's confused predilections.

799
00:55:24,070 --> 00:55:27,491
謝謝  但她沒事 Thanks, but she's fine.

800
00:55:43,965 --> 00:55:45,676
我的女士 My lady.

801
00:55:51,890 --> 00:55:53,642
派對真有意思啊 Fun party.

802
00:55:53,725 --> 00:55:56,853
沒男人  沒酒  沒點像樣的吃的  也沒有粉 A party with no men, booze, real food or drugs.

803
00:55:56,937 --> 00:55:59,648
還好我們年紀大了  無所謂了 Good thing we're too old for any trouble.

804
00:56:01,024 --> 00:56:04,486
沒錯  花園搗騰得怎么樣了 Right. How's the gardening going?

805
00:56:08,574 --> 00:56:12,453
天氣轉暖  就能真正用了 Once the thaw comes, we'll really get going.

806
00:56:12,536 --> 00:56:14,580
我本想喊你加入 Well, I'd ask you to join,

807
00:56:16,331 --> 00:56:18,834
不過看著你有自己的事兒 but you clearly have your own hobbies.

808
00:56:19,626 --> 00:56:21,419
我們得有人 We gotta have people.

809
00:56:22,420 --> 00:56:25,215
你知道這樣不會有善終 You know this will not end well.

810
00:56:31,638 --> 00:56:33,223
你真笨 You're retarded.

811
00:58:00,101 --> 00:58:02,020
你呢  查普曼 What about you, Chapman?

812
00:58:03,689 --> 00:58:06,482
就好像一次漫長的旅途后  終于回家 It's like coming home after a long trip.

813
00:58:11,780 --> 00:58:13,865
這就是愛 That's what love is like.

814
00:58:17,035 --> 00:58:18,745
就像回家 It's like coming home.

815
00:58:22,541 --> 00:58:24,209
謝謝你問我 Thanks for asking.
