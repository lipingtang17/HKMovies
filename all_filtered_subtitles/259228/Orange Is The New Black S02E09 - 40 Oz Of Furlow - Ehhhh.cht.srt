45
00:03:46,903 --> 00:03:49,530
我都沒機會跟她道別 I didn't get a chance to say goodbye.

61
00:04:38,183 --> 00:04:40,565
不過可能你的小店生意好轉了吧 in spite of the economy and everything.

62
00:04:40,625 --> 00:04:42,353
犯人  請保持隊伍前進   Let's keep the line moving, inmates.

80
00:05:22,645 --> 00:05:26,440
如果你想聽我的意見  你這方法完全不對 And if you want my opinion, you're going about this all wrong.

81
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:29,032
這一次會非常特別的 This is going to be really special.

82
00:05:29,032 --> 00:05:32,175
你即使在難吃的蛋糕上面加一層糖衣 You know, another layer of icing on a shit cake

83
00:05:32,175 --> 00:05:33,740
也不會讓它變得好吃 doesn't make it taste good.

84
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:35,242
我聽不懂你在說什么 I don't understand what you...

85
00:05:35,242 --> 00:05:37,684

約翰  這真是個美好的早晨 Why, yes, John, it's a beautiful morning.

00:06:29,838 --> 00:06:31,193
甚至很平靜 Peaceful, even.

99
00:06:31,723 --> 00:06:33,874
先生您知道的  他危及到犯人們的安全 He endangers the inmates, and you know it, sir.

100
00:06:33,874 --> 00:06:36,923
他出現在這里甚至是不合法的  是吧 I mean, it can't even be legal to have him here, can it?

101
00:06:38,429 --> 00:06:40,480
-你要不要先坐下來  -不用 - Would you like to have a seat? - No.

102
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:45,799
他的停職結束了  所以我們必須得面對 His suspension is up, so we're gonna have to deal with it.

103
00:06:45,799 --> 00:06:47,085
還有  只跟你說 And between you and me,

104
00:06:47,085 --> 00:06:50,442
管理層有人覺得我們需要人手 some of the administration feel there's a job to do.

105
00:06:51,102 --> 00:06:53,276
沒有別人能勝任這個位置 No one else is up to the task.

106
00:06:53,276 --> 00:06:54,807
我能夠 I'm up to the task.

107
00:06:54,807 --> 00:06:58,070
很好  證明一下 Good. Prove it.

108
00:06:58,688 --> 00:06:59,672
我會的 I will.

109
00:07:02,753 --> 00:07:06,049
何不說說來這的原因   用你自己的話說 Why don't we start with why you're here. In your opinion.

110
00:07:06,049 --> 00:07:10,112
有不只一個人 Well, it was... suggested to me...

111
00:07:11,071 --> 00:07:12,761
建議我要來看看 by more than one person.

112
00:07:13,155 --> 00:07:16,206
那么馬澤爾博士 So... Uh, Dr. Maser...

113
00:07:16,206 --> 00:07:19,780
叫我克莉絲就好  我不是博士 Oh, just "Chris," Please. I'm not a doctor.

114
00:07:21,398 --> 00:07:23,096
或許這不是個好主意 Maybe this was a bad idea.

115
00:07:24,734 --> 00:07:26,936
山姆  感覺不爽沒有關系 Well, it's okay to be uncomfortable, Sam.

116
00:07:27,244 --> 00:07:29,870
我會鼓勵你接受這種感覺 It's a feeling I would encourage you to embrace.

117
00:07:30,289 --> 00:07:32,502
接受它嗎  我都活在這感覺中 Embrace it? I live it.

118
00:07:33,924 --> 00:07:35,847
我對整個生活都感到不爽 My whole life is uncomfortable.

119
00:07:36,596 --> 00:07:39,805
所有這些女人  罪犯  白癡般的官僚們 All these women, criminals, bureaucratic idiots.

120
00:07:40,044 --> 00:07:42,526
我在自己家甚至都沒有家的感覺 I don't even feel at home in my own home anymore.

121
00:07:42,993 --> 00:07:44,285
現在我在一間暀W掛著 And now I'm sitting in an office 

122
00:07:44,285 --> 00:07:46,357
古怪青蛙油畫的辦公室里坐著 with some weird painting of frogs,

123
00:07:46,357 --> 00:07:48,472
而這些畫我猜本應該是舒緩心情的 which I'm guessing is supposed to be soothing.

124
00:07:49,263 --> 00:07:51,833
山姆  我覺得你的壓力很大 Sam, I'm hearing a lot of stress.

125
00:07:52,783 --> 00:07:54,783
沒錯  大到甚至都無法形容 Yeah, well, that doesn't even begin to cover it, okay?

126
00:07:55,743 --> 00:07:57,724
你喜歡你的工作嗎 Do you like your job?

127
00:07:59,958 --> 00:08:03,515
以前喜歡過  真的 I used to. I really did.

128
00:08:04,827 --> 00:08:06,112
我覺得自己很能干 I felt useful.

129
00:08:06,545 --> 00:08:07,728
是什么改變了 And what changed?

130
00:08:07,986 --> 00:08:09,109
我知道就見鬼了 Hell if I know.

131
00:08:09,755 --> 00:08:10,999
我變老了 I got older.

132
00:08:13,210 --> 00:08:14,992
或許我在乎的更少了 Maybe I care less.

133
00:08:17,507 --> 00:08:20,412
或許看得多了  知道我沒辦法改變現狀 Maybe I've seen enough to know that I won't make a difference.

134
00:08:20,412 --> 00:08:22,020
知道這是在浪費時間 That it's all a waste.

135
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:23,076
你知道 You know...

136
00:08:25,212 --> 00:08:29,383
有時候我們總從一個角度看問題  會困住 sometimes we get stuck seeing things from one perspective,

137
00:08:30,130 --> 00:08:34,180
但如果我們能稍微改變看問題的角度 but if we can just shift our perspective even a little bit,

138
00:08:34,867 --> 00:08:36,547
一切就會大不相同 makes all the difference.

139
00:08:36,784 --> 00:08:37,699
就這樣嗎 That's it?

140
00:08:39,699 --> 00:08:42,432
這就是你高達75美元一小時的建議嗎 That's your fancy, $75-an-hour advice?

141
00:08:42,505 --> 00:08:45,340
你對我的收費感到不爽嗎 Are you uncomfortable with the amount I charge?

142
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:47,298
我以為我們剛剛已經說明 I thought we just established

143
00:08:47,298 --> 00:08:49,843
我對一切都感到不爽 that I'm uncomfortable with everything!

144
00:08:52,006 --> 00:08:53,748
你一直是這樣易怒嗎 Are you always this quick to anger?

145
00:08:53,748 --> 00:08:55,989
你一直是這樣高人一等的賤人嗎 Are you always a condescending cunt?

146
00:09:01,033 --> 00:09:05,269
抱歉  我真的抱歉 Oh, I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

147
00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:09,762
我想我們的工作不好做啊 Well, I think we have our work cut out for us.

148
00:09:10,291 --> 00:09:12,288
我的鞋子有點緊 My shoes feel tight.

149
00:09:13,710 --> 00:09:15,911
我要說的是這個人叫海因里希·德萊塞 But I'm saying this guy, Heinrich Dreser,

150
00:09:15,911 --> 00:09:18,819
他應該被直接歸到壞人那一類 deserves to be right up there on the bad-guy shelf.

151
00:09:18,819 --> 00:09:20,065
我們的伙計海因里希 So, our buddy Heinrich

152
00:09:20,065 --> 00:09:22,253
拜耳  德國著名藥企

153
00:09:20,065 --> 00:09:22,253
在拜耳負責管理海洛因的藥物開發 oversaw the development of heroin at Bayer.

154
00:09:22,412 --> 00:09:27,043
拜耳公司在1900年代初期將這種藥物 Yep. So, the corporate suits at Bayer sold this shit over the counter

155
00:09:27,043 --> 00:09:30,462
作為非成癮性的嗎啡替代品放到柜臺出售 as a non-addictive morphine substitute in the early 1900s,

156
00:09:30,462 --> 00:09:32,122
你知道為什么他們稱它為海洛因嗎 and you know why they called it heroin?

157
00:09:32,122 --> 00:09:33,674
因為當他們開始測試這藥物的時候 'Cause when they started testing it,

158
00:09:33,674 --> 00:09:37,039
人們說這藥會讓他們感覺很英勇 people said it made them feel heroic. Right?

159
00:09:37,039 --> 00:09:43,131
我想站在這里作為恢復好的人  鼓勵大家 I'd like to stand up here and be all inspiring and recovered

160
00:09:43,131 --> 00:09:45,751
告訴你們我戒掉了 and tell you I'm over it,

161
00:09:45,835 --> 00:09:48,754
不過我每天還是非常想念 but I miss it every fucking day, you know?

162
00:09:48,838 --> 00:09:52,209
海洛因是我一生的愛   Uh, heroin is the love of my life, 

163
00:09:52,783 --> 00:09:54,572
她是我的最佳女友 she's my best girlfriend...

164
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,983
她是我的靈魂伴侶 she's my soul mate,

165
00:09:57,722 --> 00:10:01,320
因為沒有東西比她能讓我感覺更好受 'cause, you know, she makes me feel better than anything.

166
00:10:03,185 --> 00:10:04,907
最后我要說一句 So, in closing, uh...

167
00:10:06,396 --> 00:10:07,763
操他媽的德國人 fuck the Germans.

168
00:10:10,568 --> 00:10:13,334
好了  今天就講這些  孩子們 Okay, that's it for today, kids.

169
00:10:13,738 --> 00:10:18,498
努力接受你所不能改變的現實 Strength to accept what you cannot change,

170
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:22,622
神奇仙塵  獨角獸之類的 magical fairy dust, unicorns, etcetera.

171
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:27,917
你是羅莎對吧 Hey. Rosa, right?

172
00:10:28,152 --> 00:10:29,957
多謝你還記得我的名字 How kind of you to remember.

173
00:10:30,218 --> 00:10:32,798
你讀過這本書嗎  關于患癌兒童的 Did you read this? It's about kids with cancer.

174
00:10:32,798 --> 00:10:35,213
我不知道為什么這個傻逼作者想寫這樣的書 I don't know why the sick fuck wanted to write about this.

175
00:10:35,213 --> 00:10:38,766
總之我想你會對這本書感興趣 Anyway, I... I thought it might be right up your alley.

176
00:10:38,766 --> 00:10:41,563
我的人生已經足夠壓抑了 I got enough depressing shit in my life.

177
00:10:41,563 --> 00:10:43,271
我不想讀的書也那么壓抑 I don't need it in my books, too.

178
00:10:43,271 --> 00:10:44,707
那么你的逃避方式是什么   So, what's your escape, then, huh? 

179
00:10:44,707 --> 00:10:46,841
是吃止疼片  還是喝酒 Is it pain pills, booze?

180
00:10:47,116 --> 00:10:49,879
每個人時不時都需要幫助應對現實 Everybody needs a little bit of help with reality now and then.

181
00:10:50,192 --> 00:10:51,846
關于現實那件事 The thing about reality...

182
00:10:52,719 --> 00:10:56,624
就是它明天早上依然會等著你 is it's still there waiting for you the next morning.

183
00:10:59,016 --> 00:11:02,228
不錯的演講  辯論隊肯定會喜歡你 Nice talk. They must've loved you on the debate team.

184
00:11:02,228 --> 00:11:03,045
是啊 Oh, yeah.

185
00:11:03,045 --> 00:11:06,068
我曾連續兩年在原創辯論賽中拿第一 I was first place Original Oratory two years running.

186
00:11:06,068 --> 00:11:08,599
直到我弄傷了教練的腳趾被開除 You know, until I got expelled for breaking my coach's toe.

187
00:11:08,599 --> 00:11:11,130
一言難盡  現在說不清楚 Long story, not for now.

188
00:11:11,130 --> 00:11:12,064
可以找一天聊聊 Maybe one day.

189
00:11:12,064 --> 00:11:14,459
好的  當然 Uh, yeah, sure.

190
00:11:40,196 --> 00:11:42,523
我來這是幫你減輕負擔的 I am here to unburden you.

191
00:11:42,523 --> 00:11:43,960
拿到我的東西了沒 You got my goods?

192
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:45,957
你已經拿到大部分了 You got most of them already.

193
00:11:45,957 --> 00:11:49,767
雖然我俄語說的不溜  但在西語和英語中 Ooh, I'm not fluent in Russian, but in Spanish and English,

194
00:11:49,767 --> 00:11:52,153
"大部分"就意味著不是全部 "Most of them" Means not all of them.

195
00:11:52,153 --> 00:11:53,937
歌洛麗婭  你了解我的   Gloria, you know me. 

196
00:11:53,937 --> 00:11:55,681
其余的很快就到 The rest will be here soon.

197
00:11:55,681 --> 00:11:57,273
我是一個言出必行的女人 I'm a woman of my word.

198
00:11:57,273 --> 00:11:59,885
而我是一個要求按時交貨的女人 And I'm a woman who gets paid on time in full.

199
00:12:00,371 --> 00:12:02,733
瑞澤尼科夫  你越界了 Reznikov, you're out of bounds.

200
00:12:02,903 --> 00:12:04,334
你叫我什么來著 What did you call me?

201
00:12:05,259 --> 00:12:07,032
馬上回到界內來 Get back in bounds right now.

202
00:12:07,032 --> 00:12:09,218
你什么時候開始關心我站哪了 Since when do you care where I am?

203
00:12:09,218 --> 00:12:10,192
記過一次 That's a shot.

204
00:12:10,581 --> 00:12:13,775
307號  拒絕服從警務人員的命令 307, refusing to obey an order from a staff member.

205
00:12:13,775 --> 00:12:15,559
他現在是你的走狗嗎 He's your bulldog now?

206
00:12:15,559 --> 00:12:16,530
不是  別看我 Oh, no. Don't look at me.

207
00:12:16,530 --> 00:12:18,782
他沒鏈子拴著  我也不想被他咬 He's off leash, and I don't want to get bitten, either.

208
00:12:18,782 --> 00:12:20,204
回見 I'll see you around.

209
00:12:22,123 --> 00:12:24,304
別讓我再抓到你在廚房邊上 Don't let me catch you anywhere near the kitchen again.

210
00:12:24,304 --> 00:12:25,583
你知道該怎么做 You know the drill.

211
00:12:30,058 --> 00:12:33,387
你會是個了不起的父親 You're going to make a great father.

212
00:12:51,224 --> 00:12:52,165
你還好嗎  親愛的 You okay, hon?

213
00:12:53,743 --> 00:12:55,785
我很好  謝謝 Fine, yes. Thank you.

214
00:12:55,855 --> 00:12:58,961
這需要適應  他們是這么說的 It's an adjustment. That's what they say.

215
00:13:00,374 --> 00:13:01,890
你的生活費到了嗎 Your commissary come through yet?

216
00:13:01,890 --> 00:13:04,130
-沒有  -沒有嗎  我也是 - No. - No? Me, either.

217
00:13:04,130 --> 00:13:07,323
我昨天進來后就沒刷過牙 Haven't brushed my teeth since we came in yesterday.

218
00:13:07,323 --> 00:13:09,315
我開始感覺像是穿了一件兔毛衫 Starting to feel like an angora sweater in there.

219
00:13:16,222 --> 00:13:19,935
這里有個叫卡拉的女人  她會幫你整理 There's this lady in here, Carla, she'll wanna do that for you.

220
00:13:20,064 --> 00:13:22,759
我以前來過  我能行 I've been around before. I got it.

221
00:13:25,461 --> 00:13:27,306
我要去洗手間 I gotta take a leak.

222
00:13:32,769 --> 00:13:35,824
你是帕克嗎  我是朗達 You Parker? Rhonda.

223
00:13:36,523 --> 00:13:39,139
給你帶了一些東西  算是見面禮 Brought you some stuff, a little welcome basket.

224
00:13:40,902 --> 00:13:42,450
我們早餐時見 We'll see you at breakfast.

225
00:13:44,671 --> 00:13:46,183
我不吃早飯 I don't eat breakfast.

226
00:13:47,313 --> 00:13:48,723
早飯會讓我腸胃不適 It upsets my stomach.

227
00:13:54,395 --> 00:13:55,759
現在你要吃了  You eat it now. 

228
00:13:57,445 --> 00:13:58,199
我們走 Let's go.

229
00:14:05,135 --> 00:14:06,261
想要點嗎 Want some of this?

230
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:07,762
不用了  謝謝 No, thank you.

231
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:10,933
里面有三支牙刷  她們只是在炫耀 Three toothbrushes in here. It's just showing off.

232
00:14:12,368 --> 00:14:15,289
給你  拿一支吧 Here. Take one, please.

233
00:14:17,606 --> 00:14:18,563
謝謝 Thank you.

234
00:14:20,650 --> 00:14:22,529
牙膏也給你 Get some toothpaste, too.

235
00:14:22,987 --> 00:14:24,352
你真好 You're very kind.

236
00:14:29,416 --> 00:14:30,951
你有分配到工作嗎 You got assigned a work detail yet?

237
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:32,768
廚房 Kitchen.

238
00:14:33,897 --> 00:14:35,429
那是個好工作 That's a plum gig.

239
00:14:35,582 --> 00:14:38,242
是的  就像在家一樣 Yes, feels like home.

240
00:14:38,775 --> 00:14:42,013
我家里開了一家小店  我負責做吃的 My family, we own a small market, and I serve food there.

241
00:14:42,013 --> 00:14:44,095
是嗎  你是個好廚師嗎 Yeah? You a good cook?

242
00:14:45,269 --> 00:14:48,350
我很會做菜  還有聽著 I am very good. And get this.

243
00:14:49,202 --> 00:14:52,253
我用的原料跟這里的廚房用的一樣 I use the same produce people that the kitchen here uses.

244
00:14:52,855 --> 00:14:55,177
不過如果他們當初敢給我這里拿到的那種破爛貨 Although, if they delivered me the shit they send here,

245
00:14:55,177 --> 00:14:56,912
我會把東西扔回他們臉上 I would throw it in their faces.

246
00:14:57,271 --> 00:14:59,314
他們知道要給我好東西 They knew to give me the good stuff.

247
00:15:01,025 --> 00:15:02,109
他們欠我的 They owed me.

248
00:15:03,443 --> 00:15:05,612
現在他們真的欠我了 Now they really owe me.

249
00:15:05,695 --> 00:15:08,357
海王星  真是愚蠢的名字 Neptune. Stupid name.

250
00:15:08,357 --> 00:15:11,719
我告訴過他們海王星應該賣海鮮而不是水果 I told them Neptune is for seafood, not fruit.

251
00:15:13,916 --> 00:15:15,032
你認識供應商嗎 You know a vendor?

252
00:15:15,372 --> 00:15:19,304
不只是認識  他們是因為我來這的 Know them? They're here because of me.

253
00:15:20,379 --> 00:15:22,243
而我進這里也是因為他們 And I'm here because of them.

254
00:15:23,057 --> 00:15:26,146
你得利用這點  讓你的監獄生活好過些 You need to use that. Make your life here better.

255
00:15:27,391 --> 00:15:29,549
就是因為犯法才讓我進了監獄 Breaking rules got me in here.

256
00:15:31,105 --> 00:15:33,264
沒錯  我不是要對你指手畫腳 Yeah, well, I'm not telling you what to do, you know.

257
00:15:34,442 --> 00:15:36,446
我只是在告訴你如何生存 I'm just telling you how to survive.

258
00:15:44,466 --> 00:15:45,342
下一個 Next.

259
00:15:46,584 --> 00:15:49,155
只要一支  我剛發現 Only one. I just learned I like a smoke 

260
00:15:49,155 --> 00:15:51,011
我讀完中篇小說后  喜歡抽上一支 after I read my sexy-time novellas.

261
00:15:51,011 --> 00:15:52,937
感覺棒極了  但 It feels glamorous, but like,

262
00:15:52,937 --> 00:15:54,730
我仍然不是一個真正的煙客 I'm still not a real smoker, you know?

263
00:15:54,730 --> 00:15:55,422
沒錯  好了 Yeah, all right. 

264
00:15:55,422 --> 00:15:57,456
請確保將這本書重新放到合適的書架 Just make sure you reshelve this book in its proper place.

265
00:15:57,539 --> 00:15:59,376
我們這里是按照杜威狗屁分類法擺放的 We on Dewey decimal and shit in here.

266
00:15:59,376 --> 00:16:02,336
別讓我在超自然現象區找到水上運動的書 Don't let me find no aquatic sports over in paranormal phenomena.

267
00:16:02,419 --> 00:16:03,974
-明白  -好 - Got it. - All right.

268
00:16:05,962 --> 00:16:07,074
操 Fuck you.

269
00:16:17,517 --> 00:16:20,762
多謝了  真是量多的一天 Oh, thanks, man. Heavy flow day over here.

270
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:24,711
我把你手弄傷了嗎 I break your hand?

271
00:16:25,215 --> 00:16:26,818
快回去干活 Get back to your job.

272
00:16:38,455 --> 00:16:41,115
我按了門鈴  是不是很奇怪 Hi, I rang the bell. Is that weird?

273
00:16:41,115 --> 00:16:42,630
我不想直接走進來 I didn't wanna just walk right in.

274
00:16:42,630 --> 00:16:46,555
沒關系  不用這樣 It... It's fine. You're fine. Wow, it's...

275
00:16:47,421 --> 00:16:48,959
你真的回來了  太瘋狂了 You're actually here. It's crazy.

276
00:16:49,704 --> 00:16:50,462
是啊 Yeah.

277
00:16:53,643 --> 00:16:54,746
不許接觸 No touching!

278
00:16:55,401 --> 00:16:57,034
抱歉  我只是想讓你的過渡平穩些 Sorry. I'm just trying to ease your transition.

279
00:16:57,034 --> 00:16:59,066
變化太多太快對你不宜 Too much, too fast can be a shock to the system.

280
00:16:59,066 --> 00:17:01,064
就像戰俘們終于有東西吃的時候 Like when POWs finally get to eat,

281
00:17:01,064 --> 00:17:03,025
他們會吃太多導致把胃撐破 and then they eat too much and their stomachs explode?

282

我的天啊 Oh, my God.

285
00:17:16,363 --> 00:17:18,305
直到離開一段時間之后 You never remember what home smells like 

286
00:17:18,305 --> 00:17:19,847
你才會記得家里的味道 until you've been gone for a while.

287
00:17:20,448 --> 00:17:21,830
我記得以前總會 I remember that I always used

288
00:17:21,830 --> 00:17:23,488
在從露營回來時有這種感覺 to think about that when I got back from camp,

289

我怎么會有那么多衣服  天吶 Why do I have so many clothes? My God.

301
00:17:57,798 --> 00:18:00,543
我真的覺得需要所有這些東西嗎 Did I really think that I needed all of these?

302
00:18:00,945 --> 00:18:04,774
天啊  我的羊絨衫 Oh, my God. Oh, my God, my cashmere sweater!

萊瑞  我的褲子裝在哪袋 Larry, which one has all my pants in it?

304

她明天可能來不了 She's probably not gonna make it tomorrow.

309

她正在給孩子做睡眠訓練 She's sleep training the baby and...

310
00:18:24,161 --> 00:18:26,653
她說這個訓練真的很辛苦 she said it's been... It's been really tough on her, so...

枕頭背后有一只奶牛 The one with the cow on its back 

317

奶牛的腿都朝上的 and its legs were all up in the air?

318
00:18:44,483 --> 00:18:47,882
在奶牛下面寫著  "我很好  真的" Uh, under the cow it says, "I'm fine, really."

319
00:18:47,882 --> 00:18:50,093
多么傻逼的枕頭 What a stupid fuckin' pillow.

320

你這聲音聽著連逢場作戲都不像 Wow. You couldn't even try to make that sound like you meant it.

325
00:19:16,696 --> 00:19:18,990
不過算你走運 Well, lucky for you,

如果我不能陪著奶奶 If I can't be with Grandmother,

333

你覺得這還要多久 How much longer do you think this is gonna be?

365
00:20:53,923 --> 00:20:56,009
不久  一個小時左右 Not long. An hour or so?

366
00:20:56,009 --> 00:20:57,150
好吧  我還在想或許能 Okay, well, I was thinking that I might...

375
00:21:23,814 --> 00:21:25,963
你知道奶奶對中跟鞋的態度 You know how Grandmother felt about them.

376
00:21:26,522 --> 00:21:28,819
鞋子中的奇葩 "The boiled carrots of footwear."

377
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,396
你是把手指插進插座了么 Stick your fingers in a fucking socket?

378
00:21:35,396 --> 00:21:36,330
你頭發是怎么回事 What's wrong with your hair?

379
00:21:37,419 --> 00:21:41,326
老天啊  囚犯  你有什么毛病 Jesus Christ. What's wrong with you, inmate?

380
00:21:41,777 --> 00:21:42,741
你是在冥想嗎   You meditating? 

381
00:21:43,057 --> 00:21:45,431
快去拿點食物  吃點肉長點身子 Get some food. Put some meat on your bones, shit.

382
00:21:45,657 --> 00:21:47,255
我不吃東西 I'm not eating.

383
00:21:47,255 --> 00:21:49,868
我看的見  用我常人的眼睛就能看見   I can see that, by my normal-people eyes.

384
00:21:50,317 --> 00:21:52,286
你眼睛那么小很難看清吧 Bet those slits make it hard for you to see, huh?

385
00:21:53,616 --> 00:21:55,846
我會向管理部門投訴你的 I will report you to the administration.

386
00:21:57,218 --> 00:22:02,736
女士們  囚犯蘇蘇 Ladies! Inmate... "Soso"?

387
00:22:00,218 --> 00:22:02,736
soso也有馬馬虎虎之意

388
00:22:03,245 --> 00:22:04,665
你搞笑呢吧 You're shittin' me, right?

389
00:22:06,539 --> 00:22:12,966
囚犯蘇蘇看來違反了監獄的基本規定 Inmate Soso here seems to be violating essential prison regulations

390
00:22:12,966 --> 00:22:17,615
并且拒不服從指令  對不對 with her insubordinate attitude, does she not?

391
00:22:18,668 --> 00:22:21,149
接招吧  打小報告的 Take that, you tattletale.

392
00:22:23,422 --> 00:22:25,643
我正在發動絕食抗議 I am staging a hunger strike

393
00:22:25,643 --> 00:22:28,649
抗議這個監獄里糟糕的條件 in protest of the reprehensible conditions in this facility!

394
00:22:28,649 --> 00:22:31,014
我邀請大家參與進來  來擁護 I invite you all to join in, in standing up...

397
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:50,333
大家...請小聲點 Just... keep it down, please.

398
00:23:08,904 --> 00:23:11,558
不敢相信你居然把時間浪費在生菜上 Can't believe you're wasting your time on lettuce.

399
00:23:12,378 --> 00:23:13,856
你知道我多久沒吃過 Do you know how long it's been since...

400
00:23:15,963 --> 00:23:18,454
能咬的嘎?響的蔬菜了嗎 I had a vegetable that actually crunched?

401
00:23:27,989 --> 00:23:29,491
喝慢點  餓鬼 Whoa, easy there, Tiger.

402

404
00:23:44,297 --> 00:23:46,744
我想念你 Mmm. I missed you.

405

409
00:23:56,322 --> 00:24:03,382
你上一次射在真正的陰道里 How long has it been since you came in a real live vagina

410
00:24:03,382 --> 00:24:05,892
而不是自己手上  已經有多久了   and not in your hand? Huh?

411
00:24:05,892 --> 00:24:07,783
-好吧  -來吧  我們上樓 - Okay. - Come on, let's go upstairs.

413
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:14,827
我想你不應該喝酒  親愛的 I don't think you're supposed to be drinking, honey.

414
00:24:16,454 --> 00:24:18,277
你知道"應該"是什么意思嗎   What's "Supposed to," Anyway, you know? 

415
00:24:19,963 --> 00:24:21,323
是誰定的這些規矩 Who makes those rules?

416
00:24:21,323 --> 00:24:22,122
我相信你這個情況下   I believe it's the Federal

417
00:24:22,122 --> 00:24:23,895
規矩是聯邦懲教局定的 Department of Corrections in this case.

418
00:24:24,446 --> 00:24:25,265
去他們的 Fuck 'em.

419
00:24:26,041 --> 00:24:28,527
任何人都不愿看你因為在休假期間 The last thing anyone needs is you getting your sentence extended

420
00:24:28,527 --> 00:24:30,167
違反一些愚蠢的規定而使刑期延長 for some silly furlough violation.

421
00:24:30,167 --> 00:24:30,899
真的嗎  爸爸 Really, Dad?

422
00:24:32,729 --> 00:24:34,700
是其他人不愿看到 Is that the last thing that anyone needs,

423
00:24:34,925 --> 00:24:37,778
還是你自己不愿看到 or is that the last thing that you need,

424
00:24:37,778 --> 00:24:41,469
因為你拒絕去監獄探訪自己唯一的女兒 because you refuse to come visit your only daughter in prison

425
00:24:41,469 --> 00:24:43,814
你不希望因為這事讓自己的良心 and you'd rather not have that weighing on your conscience

426
00:24:43,814 --> 00:24:45,521
受到更多譴責  是嗎 for any longer than it has to?

427
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:48,167
帕波  我們現在能別說這些嗎   Piper, can we not do this now, please? 

428
00:24:48,168 --> 00:24:49,112
我母親過世了 My mother has died.

429
00:24:53,199 --> 00:24:56,870
好吧  對不起 Fine. Sorry.

430
00:24:57,367 --> 00:24:59,078
塞萊斯特非常以你為傲 Celeste was so proud of you.

431
00:25:00,703 --> 00:25:01,902
從你出生的那刻起 From the moment you were born.

432
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:04,088
現在很難想象這是真的 It's hard to imagine that's true anymore.

433
00:25:04,088 --> 00:25:08,048
真的  我甚至覺得因為我生了你  她更喜歡我了 It was. I even think she liked me more for having fathered you.

434
00:25:11,514 --> 00:25:12,346
親愛的  對不起   I'm sorry, honey. 

435
00:25:12,346 --> 00:25:13,923
我只是不能看到你那個樣子 I just can't see you like that.

436
00:25:15,727 --> 00:25:16,622
哪個樣子 Like what?

437
00:25:17,261 --> 00:25:18,348
你是我的寶貝女兒 You're my little girl.

438
00:25:18,895 --> 00:25:22,525
監獄里的那個女人  不是真正的你 That woman in there, that's not who you are.

439
00:25:24,797 --> 00:25:26,796
那就是我自己 That's exactly who I am.

440
00:25:37,464 --> 00:25:38,627
萊瑞 Larry?

441
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,705
我在里面 I'm in here, hello?

442
00:25:40,789 --> 00:25:43,416
停停  帕波 Hey, hey, hey! Pipes...

457
00:26:30,785 --> 00:26:31,639
我們還在服喪 We're mourning. We're...

458
00:26:31,639 --> 00:26:34,751
我們那么久沒做了  我們甚至不在一起 Ah... We haven't done this in so long. We're not even together.

459
00:26:34,751 --> 00:26:36,049
萊瑞  閉嘴 Larry. Shut up.

462
00:26:47,856 --> 00:26:52,611
你在我幫你的軟雞巴口時決定跟我說這個 You decide to tell me that with your flaccid dick in my mouth?

463
00:26:52,611 --> 00:26:53,807
噓  半硬了 Ssh! It was a semi.

464
00:26:54,941 --> 00:26:57,564
現在別在我面前維護你的雞雞 Do not defend your boner to me right now.

465
00:27:06,195 --> 00:27:07,515
抱歉  我知道這件事 I'm sorry. I know this is...

466
00:27:10,190 --> 00:27:10,934
你很難接受 tough for you. 

467
00:27:10,934 --> 00:27:13,291
你有沒有什么想問我的或者 Is there anything you wanna ask me or...

468
00:27:13,291 --> 00:27:15,007
不  上帝  我沒有   No. God, no.

469
00:27:20,451 --> 00:27:22,409
可能吧  是我認識的人嗎 Maybe. Is it someone that I know?

470
00:27:23,739 --> 00:27:24,873
是的 Yes.

471

相信我 Trust me.

475
00:27:54,510 --> 00:27:56,521
這下真的結束了  對嗎 This is really over, isn't it?

476
00:28:01,805 --> 00:28:04,256
我也不想變成這樣 I don't... I don't want it to be.

477
00:28:08,227 --> 00:28:09,478
是的  你想 Yes, you do.

478
00:28:17,611 --> 00:28:20,219
但真的說出來  感覺很糟糕 But it feels so shitty actually saying it.

479
00:28:36,464 --> 00:28:37,620
我知道 I know.

480
00:28:49,771 --> 00:28:51,802
該死  我會想你的 Fuck, I'm gonna miss you.

我也愛你 I love you, too.

483
00:29:20,484 --> 00:29:23,491
你明天不用來我奶奶的葬禮 You don't have to come to my grandmother's funeral tomorrow.

484
00:29:23,491 --> 00:29:24,640
謝天謝地 Oh, thank God.

485
00:29:26,482 --> 00:29:27,249
是啊 Yeah. 

486
00:29:31,248 --> 00:29:34,107

487
00:29:35,001 --> 00:29:38,813
那個警衛  真是個非常可怕的男人 That guard, that awful, awful man.

488
00:29:38,813 --> 00:29:39,465
哪一個 Which one?

489

新來的那個警衛   That new guard. 

490
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:43,453

00:29:44,553 --> 00:29:46,597
沒錯  他讓我加班干活 Yeah. He gave me extra work duty.

494
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:49,289
他因為我有信念而懲罰我 He's punishing me for believing in something.

495
00:29:49,289 --> 00:29:52,228
這里的人們可不喜歡信仰   Well, people don't like conviction around here. Okay? 

496
00:29:52,228 --> 00:29:53,863
這是不行的  先生 No, sir.

497
00:29:54,707 --> 00:29:55,815
我會給他們好好瞧瞧的 Well, I'm gonna show them.

498
00:29:56,565 --> 00:29:58,562
很快就沒人會吃東西了  他們會看到的 Soon, no one will be eating, and then they'll see.

499
00:29:58,562 --> 00:29:59,770
我們為什么不吃東西 Why ain't we eating?

500
00:29:59,770 --> 00:30:02,414
為了抗議這里的條件 In protest of the conditions in here.

501
00:30:02,681 --> 00:30:04,727
那真是太傻逼了 Well, that's just super stupid.

502
00:30:06,033 --> 00:30:10,556
真弱智  又下賤又殘忍又傻逼 And dumb. And mean and cruel and stupid.

503
00:30:10,556 --> 00:30:12,448
沒錯  我說了傻逼兩次 And, yeah, I said "Stupid" Twice,

504
00:30:12,448 --> 00:30:15,818
就是為了強調這事有多傻逼 only to emphasize how stupid that is.

505
00:30:15,818 --> 00:30:18,300
別去說花木蘭了 Hey, leave Mulan alone.

看看這地方  雖然我們是罪犯 You know, look around this place. We're criminals,

509
00:30:27,989 --> 00:30:28,929
但那并不意味著我們 but that don't mean we don't

510
00:30:28,929 --> 00:30:30,744
不應該受到正常人一樣的待遇 deserve to be treated like normal people.

511
00:30:30,744 --> 00:30:31,744
一點也沒錯 Exactly.

那么你想加入我嗎 So, you wanna join me?

516
00:30:44,594 --> 00:30:46,997
這取決于今天的午餐供應什么 It depends on what they're serving for lunch today, 

517
00:30:47,357 --> 00:30:48,636
但我會考慮的 but I'll think on it.

518
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:52,131
好的  如果你想知道的話 Okay. You know, I could tell you more about

519
00:30:52,131 --> 00:30:55,431
我可以多跟你講講以前的有效監獄絕食 the efficacy of prison hunger strikes historically, if you want.

520
00:30:55,431 --> 00:30:57,454

你媽媽沒有教你要尊老嗎 Didn't your mother teach you manners?

533
00:31:50,691 --> 00:31:53,617
你們這些老家伙為什么脾氣總那么暴躁 Why you old people always gotta be so cranky all the time?

534
00:31:53,617 --> 00:31:56,443

我們是來拿走屬于紅媽的東西 We're here to collect what belongs to Red.

對白人女孩來說還算不錯吧 Not too bad for a white girl, hmm?

563
00:33:35,524 --> 00:33:39,066
真的很不錯  你已經開始賣了嗎 Not too bad at all. You selling already?

564
00:33:39,066 --> 00:33:42,251
一點點  四處賣賣  試試深淺 A little. Here and there. Testing the waters.

565
00:33:42,251 --> 00:33:44,086
我可不想沖昏頭腦辦壞事 I don't wanna get in over my head.

566
00:33:45,601 --> 00:33:49,043
幾個月之后你就會成為這里的老大了 Shit, you gonna be running things around here in a few months.

567
00:33:49,818 --> 00:33:52,402
到時候見分曉  我要穩扎穩打 We'll see. Slow and steady.

568
00:33:53,706 --> 00:33:55,898
但我謝謝你的建議 But I do thank you for your advice.

569
00:33:58,134 --> 00:34:01,251
維  抱歉打擾你 Hey, Vee, I'm sorry to bother you,

570
00:34:01,251 --> 00:34:03,343
那個沒眉毛的女人 but the one without the eyebrows,

571
00:34:03,343 --> 00:34:04,462
她沒拿到錢 she ain't got her money.

572
00:34:05,008 --> 00:34:07,498
根據你的吩咐  我想你是要親自處理 Figured you'd wanna deal yourself like you told us.

573
00:34:07,498 --> 00:34:08,176
我馬上去 I'll be right there.

574
00:34:11,159 --> 00:34:13,834
我得走了  我們等一會兒再聊 I better get going. We can talk more later.

575
00:34:15,526 --> 00:34:16,721
我真是大開眼界  紅媽 I'm impressed, Red.

576
00:34:23,289 --> 00:34:24,416
紅媽幫我對付了門德斯  Red helped me with Mendez.

577
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:26,543
整個監獄都知道了嗎 Does the entire prison know?

578
00:34:26,627 --> 00:34:31,215
沒別人了  寶貝  我保證  你要放松 That's it. I promise. Babe, you need to relax.

579
00:34:31,215 --> 00:34:34,022
他回來了你怎么還能假裝一切都很好 How can you act like everything is fine when he's back here?

580
00:34:34,022 --> 00:34:35,073
他會毀掉我們的生活   He could ruin our lives. 

581
00:34:35,073 --> 00:34:37,607
他會毀了我的生活 He could... He could ruin my life.

582
00:34:40,641 --> 00:34:43,232
一切都會好的  紅媽在我們這邊 Everything's gonna be fine. Red's on our side.

583
00:34:43,602 --> 00:34:45,206
門德斯甚至都沒試著跟我談話 And Mendez doesn't even try to talk to me.

584
00:34:45,206 --> 00:34:47,301
很好  我肯定他們會 Good, I mean, I'm sure they probably...

585
00:34:47,986 --> 00:34:50,640
我肯定他們會告訴他盡可能遠離你 I'm sure they probably told him to stay as far away as possible.

586
00:34:50,817 --> 00:34:51,956
只是感到有一點奇怪 Just feels a little weird since,

587
00:34:51,957 --> 00:34:53,487
畢竟他喜歡我  you know, he's in love with me or whatever.

588
00:34:53,570 --> 00:34:55,292
至少也該試著跟我打個招呼 You would think that he'd try to say hi.

589
00:34:56,197 --> 00:34:57,279
好了  我 Okay, you know, I...

590
00:34:57,783 --> 00:34:59,535
我要去告訴卡普托  門德斯是孩子的爸爸 I'm gonna tell Caputo that Mendez is the father.

591
00:35:01,161 --> 00:35:02,152
但你那是撒謊 But that's a lie.

592
00:35:02,788 --> 00:35:03,970
他沒有和你做過愛嗎 But didn't he have sex with you?

593
00:35:05,582 --> 00:35:07,425
-做過  -好了  那他就是罪犯 - Yeah. - Okay, so he's a criminal,

594
00:35:07,425 --> 00:35:08,522
他應該被關進監獄 he deserves to go to prison.

595
00:35:09,210 --> 00:35:11,656
但你也和我做過  不管怎么說以前做過 But you have sex with me. Used to, anyways.

596
00:35:11,922 --> 00:35:13,798
那不一樣  我是愛你的 That's different. I... I love you.

597
00:35:14,550 --> 00:35:15,176
他也一樣 So does he.

598
00:35:15,842 --> 00:35:17,286
你現在是在為他辯護嗎 Are you actually defending him right now?

599
00:35:18,053 --> 00:35:19,300
我只是無法相信 I just can't believe that

600
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:20,751
你要把一個無罪之人送進監獄 you would send an innocent man to prison.

601
00:35:20,751 --> 00:35:22,349
抱歉  你在說什么  整個 I'm sorry, what? The whole...

602
00:35:22,349 --> 00:35:23,866
整個計劃就是把他送進監獄 The whole plan was to send him to prison.

603
00:35:23,892 --> 00:35:25,752
所以你才會和他做愛  難道不是嗎 I mean, that's why you fucked him in the first place, was it not?

604
00:35:25,752 --> 00:35:27,094
只不過這事沒成功 It's just... It just didn't work.

605
00:35:28,730 --> 00:35:31,376
我不知道我在做什么  她們把我說服了 I don't know what I was doing. They talked me into it.

606
00:35:31,376 --> 00:35:33,232
你知道我媽有時多嚇人 You know how scary my mom can be.

607
00:35:34,736 --> 00:35:37,448
但我花了點時間來反省  他是無辜的 But I've had time to reflect, and he's innocent.

608
00:35:37,448 --> 00:35:39,479
拜托  達婭 Oh, come on, Daya, you know

609
00:35:39,479 --> 00:35:40,790
你知道他應該被關進監獄 he deserves to go to prison for something.

610
00:35:40,790 --> 00:35:42,832
生活就是這樣的 This is... This is just how life works. 

611
00:35:43,036 --> 00:35:44,889
我需要時間考慮 Well, I need time to think.

612
00:35:45,163 --> 00:35:47,142
在沒和我商量過之前  你不許做別的事 Don't you go doing nothing without talking to me.

613
00:35:47,958 --> 00:35:48,444
聽到了嗎 You hear me?

614
00:35:50,335 --> 00:35:52,339
你是要我打完飛機還是怎么樣 Now, you want me to finish or what?

615
00:35:54,297 --> 00:35:55,298
好的 Yes.

616
00:35:58,594 --> 00:36:00,136
求你了  特別紅燈 Red light special, please.

617
00:36:00,678 --> 00:36:03,486
你們這些人就像"不要吸毒"的三維廣告 Man, you people are like a 3D "Don't do drugs" Ad.

618
00:36:04,099 --> 00:36:05,186
暗號不對嗎 Ain't that the code?

619
00:36:07,519 --> 00:36:08,804
該死  你要那么多嗎 Damn, you want that many?

620
00:36:09,771 --> 00:36:10,970
它不是就是這個價錢嗎 Isn't that what it costs?

621
00:36:12,273 --> 00:36:13,274
你在說什么 What are you talkin' about?

622
00:36:13,358 --> 00:36:14,818
那東西 The stuff.

623
00:36:14,901 --> 00:36:16,277
你可以說香煙這個詞 You can say, "Cigarette."

624
00:36:16,361 --> 00:36:18,254
什么  不是  我要特別的東西 What? No. The special stuff.

625
00:36:18,255 --> 00:36:20,824
我知道黑妞們在賣 I know the black girls are selling it.

626
00:36:20,907 --> 00:36:22,493
你是說我們看起來都一樣嗎 You saying we all look alike?

627
00:36:22,576 --> 00:36:24,798
拜托  我的整張臉都很痛    Come on, my face is all achy. 

628
00:36:24,798 --> 00:36:26,287
我想暫時失去知覺 I need to not feel it for a while.

629
00:36:26,371 --> 00:36:30,052
那就去小賣部買點阿司匹林  滾出去 Then go buy some aspirin from commissary. Get out of here.

630
00:36:30,438 --> 00:36:32,047
這些我就留下了  因為你浪費了我的時間 And I'm keeping these for my time.

631
00:36:35,130 --> 00:36:35,857
快走 Go.

632
00:36:41,415 --> 00:36:45,723
有一個圣誕節  我第一次被允許 This one Christmas, I was allowed to help Grandmother

633
00:36:45,723 --> 00:36:49,978
幫奶奶制作她非常著名的糖果曲奇 make her really famous sugar cookies for the very first time.

634
00:36:49,978 --> 00:36:52,256
我想你們大多數這些年來 I think most of you have probably

635
00:36:52,256 --> 00:36:54,224
都收到過她做的一罐餅干 received a tin of her cookies over the years.

636
00:36:54,224 --> 00:36:55,999
如果沒收到  說明奶奶不喜歡你們 If you didn't, Grandmother didn't like you.

637
00:36:57,431 --> 00:36:58,582
我只是隨便說說 I'm just sayin'.

638
00:36:58,582 --> 00:37:03,640
不管怎樣  5分鐘不到我就陷入了麻煩 Anyway, it took less than five minutes for me to mess up,

639
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:06,491
我在生面團里倒了太多小蘇打 and I poured too much baking soda into the dough

640
00:37:06,491 --> 00:37:08,845
我馬上哭了起來 and I immediately started crying.

641
00:37:08,845 --> 00:37:13,178
我以為我徹底毀了圣誕節 I thought I had completely ruined Christmas.

642
00:37:14,116 --> 00:37:16,010
但奶奶并沒有吼我 But instead of yelling at me,

643
00:37:17,036 --> 00:37:19,800
她告訴我一切都會沒事的 Grandmother told me that they were gonna be fine,

644
00:37:20,049 --> 00:37:22,770
她當時說的更好聽 and she said better, even. And then...

645
00:37:25,291 --> 00:37:31,696
她對我說  帕波  生活就是由錯誤組成的 And then she said to me, "Piper, life is made in the mistakes."

646
00:37:34,756 --> 00:37:37,963
現在回想起來  她肯定在我走后重新做了 In retrospect, I'm sure she remade them after I left, you know?

647
00:37:41,029 --> 00:37:42,091
抱歉 I'm sorry.

648
00:37:42,091 --> 00:37:43,241
沒事的  沒事的 It's okay. It's okay.

649
00:37:46,367 --> 00:37:50,627
這女人叫塞萊斯特  是吧 I mean, the woman's name was Celeste, for God's sake.

650
00:37:50,627 --> 00:37:53,052
抱歉  抱歉  神父 Uh, sorry. Sorry. Sorry, Father.

651
00:37:53,374 --> 00:37:55,040
我不知道在場的各位 Um, I don't know if any of you

652
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:56,968
是否聽過這些東西的演奏 have ever heard one of those things played before.

653
00:37:56,968 --> 00:37:58,176
我是說鋼片琴 A celeste, I mean, 

654
00:37:56,968 --> 00:37:58,176
celeste亦有鋼片琴之意

655
00:37:58,176 --> 00:38:03,332
但那有種神奇而飄渺的感覺 but it is this magical, ethereal experience.

656
00:38:03,332 --> 00:38:06,922
所有這些鋼板發出的聲響聽起來就像 All these steel plates that ting and sound like, 

657
00:38:06,922 --> 00:38:07,804
我說不清楚  就像 I don't know, like,

658
00:38:08,676 --> 00:38:12,738
就像是大海突然開始奏樂 if an ocean were to suddenly make music.

659
00:38:12,738 --> 00:38:16,671
其實那并不太像奶奶 Um... That's... That's not really like Grandmother,

660
00:38:16,671 --> 00:38:18,812
但她非常特別 but she was, she was special.

661
00:38:18,812 --> 00:38:20,107
即使你知道自己只是茫茫人海之中 She... She made you feel like 

662
00:38:20,107 --> 00:38:21,270
毫不起眼的小人物 there was something important about you

663
00:38:21,270 --> 00:38:22,539
她也會讓你感到 even when you knew you were nothing 

664
00:38:22,539 --> 00:38:26,764
自己擁有不平凡之處 but a polyp in the sea of human mundanity.

665
00:38:28,237 --> 00:38:30,102
說了很多關于大海的比喻 Lot of ocean imagery here. 

666
00:38:30,729 --> 00:38:35,414
但聽著  重點是奶奶是個了不起的女人 But look, the point is that Grandmother was a wonderful woman.

667
00:38:35,414 --> 00:38:36,819
那是我要說的重點 That's the point I'm trying to make.

668
00:38:36,819 --> 00:38:38,300
她應該得到紀念 And she should be celebrated.

669
00:38:38,910 --> 00:38:42,964
我的妹妹帕波在這里  真的非常不可思議 And my sister, Piper, is here, and that is truly incredible

670
00:38:42,964 --> 00:38:46,178
因為嚴格地說她受到聯邦政府的監護 because she is technically a ward of the federal government.

671
00:38:46,178 --> 00:38:51,379
或是剛從非洲回來的  凱西阿姨 Or... just returned from Africa, Aunt Kathy.

672
00:38:51,933 --> 00:38:55,687
不管怎樣  今天是感恩生命的一天 Um... Either way, today is a day to celebrate life.

673
00:38:55,771 --> 00:38:59,107
今天是值得慶祝的一天 Today is a day to celebrate today.

674
00:39:00,566 --> 00:39:01,593
所以 And that is why...

675
00:39:04,728 --> 00:39:07,204
我想不出更合適的時間來做這事 that is why I can't think of a better time to do this.

676
00:39:09,872 --> 00:39:13,663
來吧  來吧  我可愛的灰樹花 Come on. Come on, my little hen of the woods.

677
00:39:18,308 --> 00:39:21,483
朋友們  家人們 Friends, family...

678
00:39:21,483 --> 00:39:22,730
-快做些什么  -戀人們 - Do something. - ... lovers,

679
00:39:23,413 --> 00:39:26,084
我記不住名字的年長親戚們 older family friends that I can never remember the names of,

680
00:39:26,084 --> 00:39:28,262
內莉和我準備結婚 Neri and I are getting married...

681
00:39:29,813 --> 00:39:31,097
就在此刻 right now...

682
00:39:32,406 --> 00:39:34,488
在座的各位都將成為我們的見證人 with all of you as our witnesses.

683
00:39:34,488 --> 00:39:36,979
我們的朋友都來了  帕波也休假了 Our friends are here, Piper's on furlough,

684
00:39:36,979 --> 00:39:40,618
我們的好友山姆  上周為我們受戒 our buddy, Sam, got ordained last week just for us.

685
00:39:40,618 --> 00:39:41,904
謝謝你  山姆 Thank you, Sam.

686
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,593
內莉的家人也來了 Neri's family is here.

687
00:39:44,947 --> 00:39:46,297
后面的帕姆和喬 Pam and Joe in the back.

688
00:39:46,297 --> 00:39:48,251
伙計們  你們太可愛了  真棒 Hi, guys. You're so cute. You are awesome.

689
00:39:48,251 --> 00:39:50,939
感謝你們的到來  愛你們 Thank you for coming. Love you. And...

690
00:39:52,233 --> 00:39:55,129
我相信塞萊斯特 I think that Celeste...

691
00:39:56,246 --> 00:40:00,811
會對我們免費蹭花和食物感到開心的 would be pleased with our judicious use of the free flowers and food,

692
00:40:00,811 --> 00:40:02,410
或許會有一點點不滿 if not a tiny bit judgmental.

693
00:40:03,381 --> 00:40:06,928
我覺得她會稱贊我們的精神  對吧 And I think that she would admire our spirit, right?

694
00:40:10,220 --> 00:40:11,064
帕波 Pipes.

695
00:40:14,683 --> 00:40:16,601
我們去大快朵頤吧 We're gonna eat the world.

696
00:40:23,692 --> 00:40:24,693
抱歉了  老媽 Sorry, Mom.

697
00:40:34,619 --> 00:40:36,913
你在干什么啊 Yo, what the hell are you doin'?

698
00:40:36,997 --> 00:40:40,125
我要和你談談  我覺得維在販賣毒品 I need to talk to you. I think Vee's bringin' in drugs.

699
00:40:40,208 --> 00:40:41,809
珀比  每天重復同樣的對話 P, ain't you bored of

700
00:40:41,809 --> 00:40:44,264
你難道不覺得無聊嗎 havin' the same damn conversation every day?

701
00:40:44,264 --> 00:40:45,565
反正我覺得會無聊 Shit, I know I am.

702
00:40:45,565 --> 00:40:47,645
你給我聽著  好嗎  有一個冰妹 Yo, just listen, all right? One of them meth heads...

703
00:40:47,645 --> 00:40:51,531
停  你何不聽話別再說三道四了 No! Why don't you listen and stop running your mouth?

704
00:40:51,531 --> 00:40:55,316
誰在乎她在做什么  那是她的事 Who cares what she's doing? That's her business.

705
00:40:56,075 --> 00:40:57,230
她一直對我很好 She's been real good to me,

706
00:40:57,230 --> 00:41:00,353
我可不想背棄她 and I am not about to turn away from that.

707
00:41:00,829 --> 00:41:02,935
維是我的家人 Vee is my family.

708
00:41:03,846 --> 00:41:05,421
我以為我才是你的家人 Thought I was your family.

709
00:41:05,421 --> 00:41:07,647
你倆都是我的家人 You both are my family, yo, like...

710
00:41:07,903 --> 00:41:08,633
如果我們倆 What if we was...

711
00:41:09,279 --> 00:41:10,864
如果我們倆同時掉進海里 What if we was drownin' in the middle of the ocean,

712
00:41:10,947 --> 00:41:12,509
你只能救我們之中的一個 and you could only save one of us?

713
00:41:13,074 --> 00:41:14,117
為什么我不能把你們都救了 Why can't I save both of you?

714
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:15,394
我不知道  因為你不能 I don't know. Because you can't.

715
00:41:15,869 --> 00:41:17,203
因為船上沒有足夠位置 'Cause there's not enough room in the boat.

716
00:41:17,287 --> 00:41:19,164
難道是全世界最小的船嗎 It's, like, the world's tiniest boat or some shit?

717
00:41:19,247 --> 00:41:20,540
沒錯  好吧  就是這樣 Yes, okay? Yes.

718
00:41:20,623 --> 00:41:23,293
就像是給小孩坐的小木筏  好吧 It's like a little raft for kiddies and shit, all right?

719
00:41:23,376 --> 00:41:26,129
-你能回答我的問題嗎  -聽好了  珀比 - Can you just play the game with me? - Listen up, pussy.

720
00:41:26,212 --> 00:41:28,374
我愛你  但我受夠了 I love you, but I am done

721
00:41:28,374 --> 00:41:30,582
我不想再翻來覆去聽你說這屁事 as a burnt burger talkin' about this shit.

722
00:41:30,582 --> 00:41:34,151
別再跟我或跟別人說維的事 No more talkin' about Vee to me or to anyone.

723
00:41:34,262 --> 00:41:37,894
珀比  那女人不是鬧著玩的 And, P, that woman don't play around.

724
00:41:39,475 --> 00:41:40,729
別妨礙她 Don't get in her way.

725
00:41:41,770 --> 00:41:43,985
也別妨礙我  聽到了嗎 Or mine. You hear?

726
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:46,144
聽到了 Yeah.

727
00:41:53,114 --> 00:41:54,154
怎么了  德蓋特 What happened, Doggett?

728
00:41:54,783 --> 00:41:57,118
你知道我有時候會發瘋 You know I get mad sometimes.

729
00:41:58,954 --> 00:42:01,622
我知道我一直是個惡霸  我知道 I know I've been a bully. I know.

730
00:42:04,750 --> 00:42:07,587
但是我真的很想重新開始 But I was really trying to turn a new leaf.

731
00:42:13,634 --> 00:42:16,721
求你了 Please...

732
00:42:16,805 --> 00:42:20,225
別送我去關禁閉  求你了  海利先生 Please don't send me down to SHU, Mr. Healy, please.

733
00:42:21,043 --> 00:42:23,777
那里真的很可怕 It is truly awful down there.

734
00:42:27,315 --> 00:42:30,939
德蓋特  你是不是總是容易生氣 Doggett, have you always been quick to anger?

735
00:42:32,112 --> 00:42:32,827
你是什么意思 What you mean?

736
00:42:33,321 --> 00:42:36,759
是不是憤怒的那個你就在外表之下 I mean, does it sit right below the surface?

737
00:42:37,742 --> 00:42:41,412
在不經意間就突然爆發連自己都會大吃一驚 Does it bubble up and surprise you when you're not expecting it?

738
00:42:41,496 --> 00:42:43,293
你這里是不是像打鼓一樣 Do you have a pounding right here?

739
00:42:44,499 --> 00:42:46,251
感覺就像血管要爆裂一樣 Like, feels like a vein's gonna explode?

740
00:42:46,334 --> 00:42:47,377
是的 Yeah.

741
00:42:48,378 --> 00:42:50,255
你是靈媒嗎 Are you a psychic or something?

742
00:42:50,338 --> 00:42:51,339
不是 No.

743
00:42:51,422 --> 00:42:53,189
那你怎么此刻像在我腦袋里一樣 How are you in my head, then, right now?

744
00:42:54,675 --> 00:42:57,071
因為我自己也暴躁易怒 Because I've had anger issues of my own...

745
00:42:59,055 --> 00:43:01,731
我發現換個角度看問題 and what I've found is that a change of perspective 

746
00:43:01,731 --> 00:43:03,136
能讓一切變得不同 can make all the difference.

747
00:43:04,769 --> 00:43:08,071
你的意思是不是向左看而不是向右看 Do you mean, like, looking left rather than right kind of thing?

748
00:43:08,189 --> 00:43:09,650
正是這樣 Exactly like that.

749
00:43:11,026 --> 00:43:13,153
我不把你送去關禁閉 Instead of me sending you down to SHU,

750
00:43:14,487 --> 00:43:17,110
我要你每周來見我一次 I want you to come and visit me once a week.

751
00:43:17,615 --> 00:43:18,512
我們做什么 What would we do?

752
00:43:22,703 --> 00:43:23,536
說話 Talk.

753
00:43:25,665 --> 00:43:27,083
我們要談什么 What will we talk about?

754
00:43:27,167 --> 00:43:30,420
我可以為你的一些問題提供建議 I could counsel you through some of these issues.

755
00:43:30,503 --> 00:43:33,256
好的  謝謝 Yes, thank you. Yes.

756
00:43:35,091 --> 00:43:37,385
你真的是太好了  海利先生 That's so awfully nice of you, Mr. Healy.

757
00:43:37,468 --> 00:43:40,638
我是個好人  那是事實 I'm a nice guy. That's the truth.

758
00:43:47,395 --> 00:43:48,604
或許她們遲到了 Maybe they're runnin' late.

759
00:43:48,688 --> 00:43:51,399
這里是監獄  她們現在不會迷路的 Nah, it's a prison. They didn't get lost in the moment.

760
00:43:51,482 --> 00:43:53,151
愛拿什么拿什么 take whatever. 

761
00:43:53,607 --> 00:43:56,865
不是  我是說為什么你老為難我 No, I mean, Jesus, why you fucking breaking my balls?

762
00:43:56,905 --> 00:43:58,710
伙計  說服她們可要 Man, this took way more convincing than 

763
00:43:58,710 --> 00:44:00,797
比兩盒燕麥餡餅的價錢高得多 two boxes of oatmeal pies are worth.

764
00:44:01,409 --> 00:44:06,108
請坐  我想我們可以享受一頓家庭聚餐 Please, sit. I thought we could enjoy a family meal together.

765
00:44:06,497 --> 00:44:07,929
是你做的嗎 You made this?

766
00:44:07,929 --> 00:44:09,482
你沒有廚房還怎么做這些東西 How the fuck you do this without a kitchen?

767
00:44:09,482 --> 00:44:10,933
我是個優秀的即興廚師 I'm a good improviser.

768
00:44:10,933 --> 00:44:13,717
況且我還有這些女惡霸的幫助 And I had some help from the baddest bitches around.

769
00:44:14,426 --> 00:44:15,682
聞起來棒極了  紅媽 It smells wonderful, Red.

770
00:44:15,682 --> 00:44:16,722
并不代表好吃 Doesn't mean it tastes good.

771
00:44:16,722 --> 00:44:20,279
爸爸今晚要爛醉如泥了 Ooh! Daddy's getting blotto tonight, huh?

772
00:44:24,985 --> 00:44:27,268
感謝你能來  我知道你不一定要來的 Thank you for coming. I know you didn't have to.

773
00:44:27,352 --> 00:44:29,313
紅媽  你得讓我們知道你的秘訣 Hey, Red. Got to let us in on the secret.

774
00:44:29,314 --> 00:44:30,605
這太瘋狂了 I mean, this shit is crazy.

775
00:44:30,688 --> 00:44:32,187
你們是我的家人 You're my family.

776
00:44:33,108 --> 00:44:35,136
在座的各位對我來說都很重要 All of you are very important to me.

777
00:44:36,027 --> 00:44:38,248
過去幾個月以來 And I... let a lot of things

778
00:44:38,248 --> 00:44:40,633
我讓很多事情影響了我們之間的關系 get in the way of that these past few months.

779
00:44:40,781 --> 00:44:41,973
我真的 I truly... 

780
00:44:42,450 --> 00:44:45,403
老家伙們  給我來點那個吃的好嗎 Golden oldies. How about I get some of that slop down here, huh?

781
00:44:46,454 --> 00:44:48,227
說真的  給我上菜吧 Seriously. Food me.

782
00:44:49,874 --> 00:44:51,771
我正在給大家講話呢 I'm trying to have a moment.

783
00:44:51,771 --> 00:44:53,353
閉嘴吃你的東西吧 Now shut up and eat.

784
00:44:58,383 --> 00:44:58,957
謝謝 Thank you.

785
00:45:01,344 --> 00:45:02,951
正如我所說的 As I was saying,

786
00:45:03,846 --> 00:45:06,940
我意識到我從未說這句最重要的話 I realize I never said the most important thing...

787
00:45:11,604 --> 00:45:13,079
我很抱歉 I'm sorry.

788
00:45:17,818 --> 00:45:19,429
紅媽  我們沒有你也也過得還好 You know, Red, we've done okay without you.

789
00:45:19,623 --> 00:45:22,789
我知道  但我希望你過得更好 I know you have, but I want you to do better than okay.

790
00:45:22,907 --> 00:45:26,112
沒錯  但或許我們并不懷念某些部分 Yeah, but maybe there are some parts that we didn't miss so much.

791
00:45:26,286 --> 00:45:28,140
比如受你擺布 Like being pushed around.

792
00:45:28,140 --> 00:45:29,198
或是被燒傷 Or burned.

793
00:45:30,540 --> 00:45:34,373
吉納  我不知道是否能用言語表達 Gina, I don't know that I'll ever have the words

794
00:45:34,373 --> 00:45:37,313
我對你的遭遇有多么后悔 to express the regret I feel for what happened to you.

795
00:45:39,626 --> 00:45:41,066
我犯了錯 I made a mistake.

796
00:45:42,093 --> 00:45:44,237
我希望你接受我的道歉 I hope you accept my apology.

797
00:45:50,518 --> 00:45:51,366
好的 Okay.

798
00:45:53,271 --> 00:45:55,678
我愿意讓我們之間變得更加民主 I'm willing to make this more of a democracy,

799
00:45:55,740 --> 00:45:57,275
如果這是大家所希望的 if that's what you all want.

800
00:45:57,358 --> 00:45:59,471
我只是希望我的家人能回到我的身邊 I just want my family back.

801
00:46:00,236 --> 00:46:02,256
過來抱抱  紅媽 Oh, get over here, Red.

802
00:46:06,826 --> 00:46:09,648
諾爾瑪  我親愛的諾爾瑪 Norma. My dear Norma,

803
00:46:10,080 --> 00:46:13,035
這么多年來你一直在我身邊 you've been by my side for many years.

804
00:46:13,874 --> 00:46:16,397
你站在我身邊  聽我的指揮 You stood beside me, listened to me,

805
00:46:16,919 --> 00:46:20,373
幫我拔去肩膀后面奇怪胎記上的胎毛 plucked the hair out of that weird mole on the back of my arm.

806
00:46:21,674 --> 00:46:25,897
你是我最好的朋友  我很想你 You're my best friend, and I miss you so much.

807
00:46:33,228 --> 00:46:35,996
謝謝你能再給我一次機會 Thank you for giving me another chance.

808
00:46:36,856 --> 00:46:37,966
那我呢 What about me?

809
00:46:38,274 --> 00:46:41,455
你沒有什么特別的話要跟我說嗎 Don't you have a special dedication for me?

810
00:46:41,819 --> 00:46:46,604
大波  謝謝你一直讓我看著不順眼 Boo, thank you, for always being a pain in my ass.

811
00:46:47,629 --> 00:46:50,206
從現在開始  讓我們團結一致 Let's stick together from now on, huh?

812
00:47:08,721 --> 00:47:10,160
你想要什么 What do you want?

813
00:47:11,056 --> 00:47:12,071
聽說你在這里 Hear you have a pretty good system 

814
00:47:12,072 --> 00:47:13,796
搞了個不錯的小生意 worked out for yourself in here.

815
00:47:14,185 --> 00:47:18,132
諾爾瑪  給這位好女士拿張表格 Norma... get the nice young woman a form.

816
00:47:18,939 --> 00:47:21,734
寫下你要的東西  我會盡力的 Write down what you want, and I'll do my best.

817
00:47:21,817 --> 00:47:25,112
雖然我們最近訂單有點超負荷 We're a little overwhelmed with orders lately, though.

818
00:47:26,447 --> 00:47:29,742
我不是來這下訂單的  我是來買你公司的 I ain't here to place no orders. Here to buy the company.

819
00:47:31,035 --> 00:47:33,037
抱歉  概不出售 It's not for sale, sorry.

820
00:47:33,120 --> 00:47:34,872
你都不想聽下報價嗎 You don't even wanna hear the offer?

821
00:47:35,915 --> 00:47:36,999
你可以試試看 Try me.

822
00:47:37,082 --> 00:47:41,128
你可以住在最低安全級別的舒適區域內 You get to stay in cozy minimum security.

823
00:47:41,212 --> 00:47:43,349
并且我們也不會打斷你的肋骨 Oh, and we don't break your ribs.

824
00:47:44,715 --> 00:47:47,557
親愛的  你選擇挑起了 You, my dear, have chosen

825
00:47:47,557 --> 00:47:51,101
一場無法贏得的戰爭 the one fight in here that can't be won.

826
00:47:52,432 --> 00:47:54,419
跑去告訴你老媽 Go run to your mommy,

827
00:47:54,934 --> 00:47:57,249
跟她說紅媽要跟她談談 tell her Red needs to talk to her,

828
00:47:57,583 --> 00:48:00,081
然后我們大人們自然會討論的 then the adults will discuss this.

829
00:48:00,315 --> 00:48:03,651
你知道那是個極其愚蠢的決定  對吧 You know that's a real stupid move, right?

830
00:48:03,734 --> 00:48:06,153
我很高興幫你邀請她來 I mean, I'm happy to go get her for you.

831
00:48:07,697 --> 00:48:09,783
反正今天已經有夠無聊了 Today has been kind of boring, anyhow.

832
00:48:10,491 --> 00:48:13,369
去吧  去吧  快去 Go. Go, go, go.

833
00:48:21,126 --> 00:48:22,753
不好意思  或許我真的是個白癡 I'm sorry. Maybe I'm just an idiot.

834
00:48:22,837 --> 00:48:25,256
因為我想了很久也沒想明白 'Cause I'm having a hard motherfucking time understanding

835
00:48:25,340 --> 00:48:28,259
三個老女人是怎么來這里偷了我們的東西 how three little old ladies come in here and stole from us.

836
00:48:28,343 --> 00:48:29,844
她們真的很嚇人 They was really scary.

837
00:48:29,927 --> 00:48:31,737
就是  她們其中有個人看著像迪斯尼的女巫 Yeah, and one of 'em looked like a Disney witch.

838
00:48:35,057 --> 00:48:37,268
你知道嗎  快從我面前滾蛋 You know what? Go! Get... Get out of my face.

839
00:48:40,355 --> 00:48:42,273
紅媽向你表示道歉 Red sends her apologies.

840
00:48:47,862 --> 00:48:49,140
我討厭這個廚房 I hate this kitchen.

841
00:49:06,547 --> 00:49:09,285
這他媽是什么 What the fuck is this? Huh?

842
00:49:10,385 --> 00:49:11,552
這是什么 What is this?

843
00:49:12,678 --> 00:49:14,347
你以為自己能在這里偷偷抽這東西嗎 You think you can just get away with this shit in here?

844
00:49:14,430 --> 00:49:16,482
你以為我會視而不見嗎   You think I'm gonna turn a blind eye? 

845
00:49:16,483 --> 00:49:17,845
以為我是個娘們嗎 Think I'm a pussy?

846
00:49:19,519 --> 00:49:21,582
是時候要像以前一樣搜查了  女士們 It's time for a good old-fashioned search, ladies.

847
00:49:32,388 --> 00:49:33,634
這是什么 Oh, what is this?

848
00:49:35,117 --> 00:49:36,353
非法違禁品嗎 Illegal contraband?

849
00:49:38,654 --> 00:49:40,780
囚犯  你那么安靜  現在沒話說了嗎 You're awfully quiet, inmate. Got nothing to say now?

850
00:49:40,956 --> 00:49:44,816
你害怕了嗎  你他媽就應該害怕 You scared? 'Cause you fucking should be!

851
00:49:45,085 --> 00:49:48,344
這里歸我管理  我是老大 I'm in control! I'm in charge!

852
00:49:59,975 --> 00:50:02,186
-我操  -停停停  伙計 - Fuckin'... - Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Buddy!

853
00:50:05,731 --> 00:50:07,942
我們要整死你們  把你們全部整死 We are gonna fucking crack down on you! On all of you!

854
00:50:08,025 --> 00:50:10,547
你會害自己被炒的  伙計 Hey! You're gonna get yourself fired, pal.

855
00:50:12,822 --> 00:50:15,007
沒事了  行了 It's okay. Come on.

856
00:50:16,617 --> 00:50:19,787
你還好嗎  來吧  我們走 You all right? Come on. Let's get you out of here.

857
00:50:20,204 --> 00:50:21,524
女士們  都沒事了   Everything's okay, ladies. 

858
00:50:22,931 --> 00:50:24,518
把這里整理干凈  好吧 Just clean this shit up, all right?

859
00:50:40,725 --> 00:50:43,811
抱歉打擾你們了  走吧 Sorry for the fuss. Come on.

860
00:50:44,979 --> 00:50:46,069
你沒事了  伙計  走吧 You're all right, buddy. Come on.

861
00:50:53,028 --> 00:50:55,961
現在女士們先生們   And now, ladies and gentlemen, 

862
00:50:55,961 --> 00:50:59,873
新娘和新郎第一次閃亮登場 for the very first time, the bride and the groom.

863
00:51:01,570 --> 00:51:04,338
真的很高興你能來  帕波 It's so wonderful that you could be here, Piper.

864
00:51:05,452 --> 00:51:06,591
你還好嗎 How are you doing?

865
00:51:08,919 --> 00:51:11,780
挺好  我很好 Fine. I'm fine.

866
00:51:11,964 --> 00:51:14,046
如果朱莉像你這個樣子的話 We would be so heartbroken for our Julie 

867
00:51:14,046 --> 00:51:16,375
我們會很傷心的 if she were in your position.

868
00:51:16,761 --> 00:51:19,780
你知道嗎  我們剛還在說 You know what, we were just talking earlier

869
00:51:19,889 --> 00:51:22,091
你曾經是個多么棒的孩子 about what a wonderful kid you were.

870
00:51:22,558 --> 00:51:26,851
總是在報紙上看到你  一直很成功 Always in the newspaper for something and always achieving.

871
00:51:28,398 --> 00:51:29,772
親愛的  我們只想告訴你   We just want you to know, dear, 

872
00:51:29,772 --> 00:51:32,728
我們覺得你還是原來那個你 we still see you as that person.

873
00:51:32,728 --> 00:51:36,280
我相信你很渴望做回自己 I'm sure you're anxious to return to your old self.

874
00:51:47,708 --> 00:51:49,468
事實上  我不渴望 I'm not, actually.

875
00:52:10,558 --> 00:52:17,788
出租

876
00:53:33,105 --> 00:53:34,607
好了 Well, now.

877
00:53:35,315 --> 00:53:38,229
我等的黑美人終于來了 There's the black beauty I've been waitin' for.

878
00:53:38,229 --> 00:53:39,383
我能幫你嗎 Can I help you?

879
00:53:39,820 --> 00:53:42,407
妹子  我覺得應該反過來說才是 I think that's the other way around, sistah.

880
00:53:42,949 --> 00:53:44,981
老天啊  難道我在這里 Jesus. Can't even brush your teeth around here 

881
00:53:44,981 --> 00:53:45,992
都不能安安靜靜刷個牙嗎 without getting into something.

882
00:53:46,118 --> 00:53:47,386
你到底要干什么 What do you want, man?

883
00:53:47,411 --> 00:53:51,967
找到另一個走私路子對你而言值多少 How much would it be worth to you to find another route in?

884
00:53:54,084 --> 00:53:55,443
取決于這個路子到哪的 Depends on where the route goes.

885
00:53:55,711 --> 00:53:58,853
你懂得  除非我知道能得到什么 Oh, now, you know I can't give you information

886
00:53:59,525 --> 00:54:01,480
否則我不能把信息告訴你 unless I know what I'm getting for it.

887
00:54:03,594 --> 00:54:05,275
我應該對這個有興趣嗎 And I'm supposed to be interested in that?

888
00:54:08,186 --> 00:54:10,677
我知道紅媽是怎么把違禁品運進來的 I know how Red's importing contraband.

889
00:54:11,569 --> 00:54:12,826
有興趣嗎 Interested in that?

890
00:54:13,746 --> 00:54:16,847
而且我還知道警衛們快發現你們了 'Cause I also know that the guards are hot on your trail.

891
00:54:17,654 --> 00:54:20,233
所以你需要一個新的掩護  對吧 So you're gonna need a new cover, right?

892
00:54:20,527 --> 00:54:23,055
我要煙草收益的2成 I want 20% of tobacco intake.

893
00:54:26,158 --> 00:54:28,410
你真是個自以為是的拉拉  不是嗎 You are a smug little dyke, aren't you?

894
00:54:28,493 --> 00:54:33,165
不不不  我是又壯又聰明的拉拉 Oh, no, no, no, no, no. I am a big, smart dyke.

895
00:54:33,248 --> 00:54:35,334
是的  夫人 Yes, ma'am.

896
00:54:37,878 --> 00:54:39,046
1成 10%.

897
00:54:41,548 --> 00:54:43,092
成交 Got yourself a deal.

898
00:54:57,397 --> 00:55:00,767
你是不是把你的野狗栓回去了 Did you get your pack of wild dogs under control?

899
00:55:00,767 --> 00:55:02,038
她們一直很聽話 They're always obedient.

900
00:55:02,038 --> 00:55:06,227
那就好  我不想在這里再見到她們 Good. Then I'll look forward to never seeing them in here again.

901
00:55:09,744 --> 00:55:11,759
紅媽  你以為是誰下的命令   Who do you think gave the order, Red?

902
00:55:14,832 --> 00:55:15,833
你是我的朋友 You're my friend.

903
00:55:15,916 --> 00:55:19,128
我不記得我們有交換過友誼手鏈 I don't remember us exchanging woven bracelets.

904
00:55:21,546 --> 00:55:25,550
你不能奪走我的生意  這是我創立的 You're not taking over my business. I started it.

905
00:55:25,635 --> 00:55:28,512
拜托  難道我們不能分享嗎 Come on. Can't we share?

906
00:55:28,595 --> 00:55:31,056
當初難道不是我給你出的主意嗎 Didn't I give you the idea in the first place?

907
00:55:31,140 --> 00:55:32,432
現在一下子就成了你的了嗎 Now all of a sudden, it's yours?

908
00:55:32,516 --> 00:55:34,268
你對朗達做了什么 What did you do to Rhonda?

909
00:55:36,436 --> 00:55:38,355
以后就這樣好了 Here's what's gonna happen.

910
00:55:38,438 --> 00:55:40,399
你繼續接受訂單并出貨 You're gonna keep taking orders and filling them.

911
00:55:41,566 --> 00:55:46,864
我的人負責配送和收錢 My girls will be distributing the goods and collecting the payments.

912
00:55:46,947 --> 00:55:48,699
我會告訴海利的 I'll tell Healy.

913
00:55:48,783 --> 00:55:50,367
紅媽 Oh, Red.

914
00:55:52,710 --> 00:55:53,660
你那么做的話 You do that,

915
00:55:54,329 --> 00:55:58,668
我會保證你的下場就和朗達一樣 and I will make sure that you end up exactly like Rhonda.

916
00:55:59,794 --> 00:56:03,150
你休想把我的生意奪走 You are not taking this from me.

917
00:56:03,463 --> 00:56:06,684
你犯的第一個錯誤就是沒有后援 Your first mistake is not having backup.

918
00:56:14,892 --> 00:56:15,427
動手 Go ahead.

919
00:57:03,690 --> 00:57:06,460
我有個禮物要給你 Hey, I got a gift for you.

920
00:57:06,777 --> 00:57:08,523
亂說  我生日都沒到 Shit, it's not even my birthday.

921
00:57:10,197 --> 00:57:12,799
第一次免費  如果還要的話就跟我說 First one's free. Let me know if you want more.

922
00:57:26,714 --> 00:57:28,357
當我說證明給我看的時候   When I said prove it, 

923
00:57:28,357 --> 00:57:31,426
我意思是像泰勒教練那樣 I meant it in a Coach Taylor kind of way.

924
00:57:28,357 --> 00:57:31,426
泰勒教練  《勝利之光》中的經典角色

925
00:57:31,510 --> 00:57:35,244
而不是恐嚇囚犯  讓自己停職 Not a "Terrify all the inmates, get yourself suspended" Way.

926
00:57:35,973 --> 00:57:39,494
抱歉  先生  我也不知道自己是怎么了 Sorry, sir. I don't know what... I don't know what got into me.

927
00:57:39,494 --> 00:57:41,322
本尼特  現在麻煩事夠多了 I don't have time for any more headaches

928
00:57:41,322 --> 00:57:43,432
我沒時間再處理更多的頭痛事了 on top of everything else right now, Bennett.

929
00:57:43,688 --> 00:57:46,910
我知道  只是記過配額指標 I understand. I'm just... just under a lot of stress

930
00:57:46,910 --> 00:57:52,322
以及一些私事  讓我感到很有壓力 with the shot quota and some, uh... some personal stuff.

931
00:57:52,406 --> 00:57:53,665
好吧  你的私事 Yes, and your personal crap 

932
00:57:53,666 --> 00:57:56,243
應該和你的小玩具一起放在家里 belongs at home next to your tchotchkes.

933
00:57:56,326 --> 00:57:57,931
但問題就在這兒  先生 Well, that's the thing, sir,

934
00:57:57,932 --> 00:58:00,455
我并不能把那件事放在家中 I... can't exactly leave this stuff at home.

935
00:58:01,916 --> 00:58:02,893
你想跟我說什么 What are you trying to tell me?

936
00:58:07,254 --> 00:58:11,091
迪亞茨懷孕了  達婭娜 Diaz is pregnant. Dayanara.

937
00:58:12,676 --> 00:58:13,718
什么 What?

938
00:58:17,597 --> 00:58:19,058
肯定是門德斯的 Must've been Mendez.
