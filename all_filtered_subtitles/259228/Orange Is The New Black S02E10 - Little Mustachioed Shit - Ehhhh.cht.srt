00:01:39,625 --> 00:01:40,626
很差勁對嗎
Horrible, wasn't it?

4
00:01:42,169 --> 00:01:43,211
最差勁了
The worst.

5
00:01:45,756 --> 00:01:47,716
你這個做得真差勁
You're really bad at that.

6
00:01:50,803 --> 00:01:51,845
讓我服務你好嗎
Can I do you?

7
00:01:53,806 --> 00:01:55,766
你不必問
You don't have to ask.

8
00:01:57,435 --> 00:02:00,438
我從來沒有過真正地...
I've never really...

為女人口交過嗎
Gone down on a woman before?

00:02:09,947 --> 00:02:10,948
沒有
No.

12
00:02:12,783 --> 00:02:14,327
你算是哪門子的女同啊
What kind of a lesbian are you?

13
00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:16,829
摸咪咪的
The boob-touching kind. 

14
00:02:16,912 --> 00:02:18,747
那好吧
All right, well...

15
00:02:20,333 --> 00:02:22,125
你準備好"俯身"一試嗎
Are you ready to take the plunge...

16
00:02:23,126 --> 00:02:24,127
可以這樣說
so to speak?

17
00:02:24,211 --> 00:02:25,879
你會教我嗎
Are you gonna coach me through it?

18

阿姆斯特丹現在幾點
What time is it in Amsterdam?

22
00:02:42,896 --> 00:02:44,106
我不知道
I have no idea.

23
00:02:44,189 --> 00:02:46,817
等我一下
Okay, um, give me a second. 

24
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:49,111
對不起  生意上的事
I'm sorry, it's business.

25
00:02:49,194 --> 00:02:50,278
我馬上回來
I'll be right back.

26
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:53,782
你要喝杯水嗎
Do you want a glass of water?

27
00:02:53,866 --> 00:02:55,784
這也是反應之一嗎
Is that a part of it?

28
00:02:56,994 --> 00:02:57,995

Hydration?

她就這樣闖了進來
She just broke in here.

這是我的女友  你這個婊子
That's my girlfriend, you whore.

不
No.

42
00:03:36,992 --> 00:03:39,077
把她趕出去
Get her the fuck out of here.

43
00:03:39,161 --> 00:03:40,058
我會的
Okay, I will. I'm gonna get

44
00:03:40,059 --> 00:03:41,455
我會讓她走  然后我們談談
her out of here and then we're gonna talk.

45
00:03:41,539 --> 00:03:43,832
我說了  讓她滾  立刻
I said, get her out! Now!

46
00:03:43,916 --> 00:03:46,126
西爾維  別這樣  西爾維
Sylvie. Come on, Sylvie.

47
00:03:47,127 --> 00:03:48,128
你的女友
Your girlfriend?

48
00:03:49,547 --> 00:03:52,007
很復雜  帕波
It's complicated, Piper.

49
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:53,133
真操蛋
This is so fucked up.

50
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:54,635
對不起  我應該說的
I'm sorry, I should've said something.

51
00:03:54,718 --> 00:03:56,136
你以為呢
You think?

52
00:03:56,219 --> 00:03:57,596
你受傷了嗎  她打傷你了嗎
Are you hurt? Did she hurt you?

53
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,139
她揍了我的臉
She punched me in the face.

54
00:03:59,222 --> 00:04:00,599
對  很痛
Yes, it hurts.

55
00:04:00,683 --> 00:04:02,726
媽的  我另一只鞋呢
Fuck, where is my other shoe?

56
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:05,854
我只是  不斷見到你
I just... I kept seeing you around and...

57
00:04:05,938 --> 00:04:07,815
我喜歡你  然后你打來電話
You know, I liked you, and then when you called...

58
00:04:07,898 --> 00:04:11,151
閉嘴  別說了  你越描越黑
Okay, stop it. Please don't. You're making it worse.

59
00:04:11,234 --> 00:04:12,653
給
Here. 

60
00:04:12,736 --> 00:04:14,237
你找到另一只鞋子了嗎
Did you find your other shoe?

61
00:04:14,321 --> 00:04:15,531
算了
Forget it.

62
00:04:15,614 --> 00:04:18,451
你沒鞋怎么走回家 
What? You can't walk home without your shoes.

63
00:04:18,534 --> 00:04:20,410
你的鞋子很漂亮
They're nice shoes.

64
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:24,081
馬歇爾百貨買的  操你媽

Strip.

66

你也早上好
Good morning to you, too.

67
00:04:30,921 --> 00:04:32,172
你噴了香水嗎
You wearing perfume?

68
00:04:32,255 --> 00:04:33,256
的確是的
I am, in fact.

69
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:35,509
我離開家前噴了點身體噴霧
I put on a little spritz right before I left the house.

70
00:04:35,593 --> 00:04:36,594
你鼻子很靈
You have a good nose.

71
00:04:36,677 --> 00:04:39,513
我有時會在耳后擦杏仁精
I put almond extract behind my ears sometimes.

72
00:04:39,597 --> 00:04:41,056
讓我聞起來一股曲奇味
Makes me smell like a cookie.

73
00:04:41,139 --> 00:04:44,017
別廢話了  下蹲咳嗽
Anyway, let's get to the squat and cough.

74
00:04:44,935 --> 00:04:45,978
好的
Okay.

75
00:04:53,068 --> 00:04:55,362
瞧瞧  她來啦
Well, well, there she is.

76
00:04:55,445 --> 00:04:57,990
-浪子回來了  -是的
- The prodigal daughter returns. - Yep.

77
00:04:58,073 --> 00:04:59,150
還沒到早上8點
It's not even 8:00 A.M.

78
00:04:59,151 --> 00:05:01,118
我已經被揩了三次油了
And I've already been felt up three times.

79
00:05:01,201 --> 00:05:03,120
-怎么樣  -摸奶頭摸得不夠
- How was it? - Not enough nipple play.

80
00:05:03,203 --> 00:05:05,038
好笑
Funny. 

81
00:05:05,122 --> 00:05:07,374
這么說你不想談
So you don't wanna talk about it?

82
00:05:07,457 --> 00:05:09,376
我還在慢慢接受中
I'm, uh, still processing, you know.

83
00:05:09,459 --> 00:05:11,336
和老年人尷尬的交談
Awkward conversations with old people,

84
00:05:11,419 --> 00:05:13,790
糟糕的干酪盤  葬禮

85
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:16,717
婚禮  麥芽啤酒

48小時體驗一輩子

87

用非塑料的盤子吃東西

90
00:05:26,018 --> 00:05:29,312
你有空閑時間嗎
Did you by any chance have time?

91
00:05:32,983 --> 00:05:33,984
我有
I did.

92
00:05:35,485 --> 00:05:36,570
我有些不敢問
I'm afraid to ask.

93
00:05:38,614 --> 00:05:41,617
很棒  非常棒
It was great. It was really great.

94
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:43,417
真是皇后區的一處好地方
And that is such a cute part of Queens.

95
00:05:43,418 --> 00:05:44,870
我之前沒怎么去過
I've never spent much time there.

96
00:05:44,953 --> 00:05:45,954
你進去了嗎
Did you go in?

97
00:05:46,664 --> 00:05:48,331
時間不長
For a minute.

98
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:51,251
生意很好  還排了隊
You know, it's doing really well. There was even a line.

99
00:05:51,334 --> 00:05:52,920
你點了什么嗎
But you ordered something?

100
00:05:53,003 --> 00:05:55,923
點了  我...
Yes! I, um...

我明白你為什么為之如此驕傲
I can really see why you are so proud of it.

108
00:06:14,608 --> 00:06:16,359
真的謝謝你

109
00:06:16,443 --> 00:06:19,780
我的兒子們告訴我生意很差
My boys had told me business was bad, and, you know,

110
00:06:19,863 --> 00:06:22,074
在這里  我無能為力
from in here, there's nothing I can do.

111
00:06:22,991 --> 00:06:25,493
感謝上帝有了轉機

112
00:06:26,536 --> 00:06:28,789

114

他上了別人

115
00:06:37,047 --> 00:06:38,506
他告訴你的嗎
He told you this?

116
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:43,345
在醉酒極度悲傷的性交過程中說的
In the middle of a drunken, grief-stricken sexual encounter.

117

你知道最奇怪的是什么嗎
But you know what the weirdest thing was?

118
00:06:44,722 --> 00:06:47,057
我甚至一點也不生氣
I wasn't even mad. At all.

119
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:49,685
這也說得通  一報還一報      
It kind of made sense. Tit for tat.

120
00:06:49,768 --> 00:06:53,606
我們的情況是奶子換奶子  
Or, well, tit for tit, as the case may be.

121
00:06:53,689 --> 00:06:55,608
親愛的
Oh, honey,

122
00:06:55,691 --> 00:06:58,318
你心胸比我寬廣

-他上的誰  -我不想知道
- Who was it? - I didn't wanna know.

124
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:03,490

- Oh, bullshit. - No, really, I didn't wanna know.

他告訴我  是我認識的人
He told me it was someone I know,

126
00:07:05,629 --> 00:07:07,870
知道是誰只會更糟
and a name would just make it worse.

127
00:07:08,787 --> 00:07:11,581
你知道誰最有可能嗎  我們的鄰居娜塔利
But you know who it probably was? Our neighbor, Natalie.

128
00:07:11,665 --> 00:07:13,667
她是瑜伽教練
She's a Bikram teacher.

129
00:07:13,751 --> 00:07:15,293
很嗲那種
She's very touchy-feely,

130
00:07:15,377 --> 00:07:17,671
總是讓我們去免費上課
she's always offering us lots of free classes.

131
00:07:20,257 --> 00:07:22,718
但誰在乎啊  根本不重要
But who cares? It doesn't matter anyway.

132
00:07:22,801 --> 00:07:24,594
我們分手了
We broke up.

133
00:07:24,678 --> 00:07:27,097
是我先出軌的  不是嗎
I'm the one who cheated first, right?

134
00:07:29,557 --> 00:07:31,601
你有信

135
00:07:37,775 --> 00:07:39,442
是沃斯寄來的

感謝你為我抽出時間

137

別忘了  女士們

140
00:08:01,464 --> 00:08:03,633

Be aware of overeating.

141
00:08:12,142 --> 00:08:14,394
有兩份華夫餅
There's two waffles on there.

142
00:08:18,481 --> 00:08:19,607
你媽的在做什么

143
00:08:19,692 --> 00:08:23,236
怎么啦  她們多給煙我抽

144
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:24,822
謝謝
Thank you.

145
00:08:34,622 --> 00:08:36,208
有話要對我說嗎
You got something to say to me?

146
00:08:36,291 --> 00:08:37,667
我的姑娘們需要你的座位
My girls need your seat.

147
00:08:37,751 --> 00:08:39,878
我吃完后  她們就可以坐了
And when I'm done, they can have it.

148
00:08:56,186 --> 00:08:57,730
吃完了嗎
Done yet?

149
00:09:02,192 --> 00:09:05,070
你真是一個無禮的女人
You are a very rude woman.

150
00:09:05,153 --> 00:09:06,864
人家傷心死了
Oh, you wound me.

151
00:09:08,991 --> 00:09:12,077
媽的  維  咱在這里屌爆了
Yo, damn, Vee! Yo, we like ballers up in here!

152
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:15,122
我不是說了嗎  你能給別人所需時...
Didn't I tell y'all? When you got something people want...

153
00:09:15,205 --> 00:09:16,376
今天早上
Yo, this morning,

154
00:09:16,377 --> 00:09:20,168
爆牙克萊門蒂諾居然在浴室等我
Underbite Clementino was waiting for me in the bathroom

155
00:09:20,252 --> 00:09:22,129
給我來個背部按摩
to give me a back massage.

156
00:09:22,212 --> 00:09:23,756
-什么  -背部按摩
- What? - A back massage!

157
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:27,425
感覺我像是圣特魯佩斯一艘游艇上的碧昂斯
Like I'm fucking Beyonce in a yacht in Saint-Tropez, okay!

158
00:09:31,263 --> 00:09:33,556
下雨吧  賤人們
Make it rain, bitches.

159
00:09:35,725 --> 00:09:38,395
小賣部女王駕到
Commissary queen in the hizzy!

160
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:41,648
媽的  感覺真好
Fuck, this feels good.

161
00:09:41,731 --> 00:09:43,275
我把常那里掃蕩了
I cleaned Chang out.

162
00:09:43,358 --> 00:09:45,886
你什么都買走了  
"You take-a the everything! 

163
00:09:45,887 --> 00:09:48,696
沒有東西給其他女士了
Nothing reft for the other ladies."

164
00:09:48,781 --> 00:09:52,159
我不是說過嗎  維會照顧我們的
Yo, didn't I tell you that Vee was gonna take care of us?

165
00:09:52,242 --> 00:09:55,078
制度關著我們  你就得找到應對的辦法
System work you, you got to find a way to work the system.

166
00:09:55,162 --> 00:09:57,622
-阿門  -贊美主啊  哈利路亞
- Amen! - Gloria, hallelujah!

167
00:09:59,917 --> 00:10:02,627
誰給你剪的頭發  丹妮塔嗎
Who cuts your hair? Danita?

168
00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:04,046
當然不是
Hell, no!

169
00:10:04,129 --> 00:10:06,506
我才不會讓那個屠夫拿著剪刀接近我
I wouldn't let that butcher near me with a pair of scissors.

170
00:10:06,589 --> 00:10:08,216
我自己打理的
I do it myself.

171
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:10,552
別看后面  一團糟
Don't look at the back, it's a mess.

172
00:10:10,635 --> 00:10:12,512
什么大場合
What's the occasion?

173
00:10:12,595 --> 00:10:13,889
我兒子來看我
My son's coming to visit.

174
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:17,017
如果他沒注意到  你別生氣
Well, don't be upset if he doesn't notice.

175
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:20,103
男孩子蠢死了  他們永遠不會注意到這種事
Boys are stupid. They never notice things like that.

176
00:10:20,187 --> 00:10:23,231
邁克爾很久沒見過我了
Michael hasn't seen me in a long time.

177
00:10:23,315 --> 00:10:24,774
他從未來過
He's never come before.

178
00:10:25,733 --> 00:10:26,902
為什么不來
Why not?

179
00:10:27,945 --> 00:10:29,696
他很生氣
He was pissed off.

180
00:10:29,779 --> 00:10:31,949
或覺得丟人  或兩者都有
Or ashamed. Or both.

181
00:10:33,616 --> 00:10:35,285
是他舉報我的
He turned me in.

182
00:10:37,079 --> 00:10:38,257
那你打算在探視
So, you're strangling him

183
00:10:38,258 --> 00:10:40,332
開始還是結束時掐死他
at the beginning of the visit or at the end?

184
00:10:40,415 --> 00:10:43,710
他只有12歲  非常憤怒
He was only 12 and angry.

185
00:10:43,793 --> 00:10:44,962
他經歷了太多
He's been through a lot.

186
00:10:45,045 --> 00:10:50,008
我會坐好  讓他發泄  把怨氣全發泄出來
I'm gonna sit back, let him vent. You know, get it all out.

187
00:10:50,092 --> 00:10:51,759
要是我  就踢死他
Well, if it were me, I'd kick him to death,

188
00:10:51,844 --> 00:10:55,347
但我們做父母的方式不同
but we all have our own way of parenting.

189
00:10:55,430 --> 00:10:58,391
甘地這么做來抗議種姓制度
Gandhi did it to protest the caste system.

190
00:10:58,475 --> 00:11:00,853
只有這樣才能有所改變
It's the only way to make a real difference.

191
00:11:00,936 --> 00:11:02,604
你就省省吧
You're wasting your breath.

192
00:11:02,687 --> 00:11:05,398
你無法說服這些人絕食的
You're not gonna convince this crowd not to eat.

193
00:11:05,482 --> 00:11:06,984
她是對的
She's right.

194
00:11:07,067 --> 00:11:10,362
這碗麥片味道像大團鼻屎
I mean, this oatmeal tastes like a bowl of chunky boogers,

195
00:11:10,445 --> 00:11:12,655
但媽的不吃還不舒服了
but fuck if it isn't comforting to keep shoveling it in.

196
00:11:13,448 --> 00:11:15,825
這么說  你們都很滿意現狀
So I suppose you're all happy with the way things are going?

197
00:11:16,994 --> 00:11:19,913
你們覺得這座監獄的現狀非常好嗎
You think the conditions in this prison are perfectly fine?

198
00:11:19,997 --> 00:11:21,681
聯邦政府的錢應該用在
That federal money should be

199
00:11:21,682 --> 00:11:24,751
讓女人在滿是排泄物的隔間里洗澡
spent on making women shower in feces-soaked stalls

200
00:11:24,834 --> 00:11:27,379
而她們反抗時卻要遭受身體虐待嗎
and face physical abuse if they resist?

201
00:11:27,462 --> 00:11:29,839
來吧  簡·方達[影星]  來點香腸  
Come on, Jane Fonda, have a little bit of sausage.

202
00:11:29,923 --> 00:11:33,218
對  就一小口  你看起來臉色蒼白
Yeah, just a little bite. You look a bit pale.

203
00:11:33,301 --> 00:11:34,594
已經多少天了
How many days has it been?

204
00:11:34,677 --> 00:11:37,305
拜托  別煩她了
Come on, leave her alone.

205
00:11:37,389 --> 00:11:38,974
修女
Sister?

206
00:11:39,057 --> 00:11:40,934
我以為至少你會支持我
I thought you of all people would support me.

207
00:11:41,018 --> 00:11:44,312
親愛的  這里又不是關塔那摩監獄
Oh, honey, it's not Guantanamo.

208
00:11:44,396 --> 00:11:45,480
就是
Yeah!

209
00:11:46,398 --> 00:11:48,358
讓一下  蘇蘇
Yeah, move over, Soso.

210
00:11:49,276 --> 00:11:52,404
好吧  我一個人來
Fine. I'll do it alone.

211
00:12:04,749 --> 00:12:07,794
你真是太無禮了
That is really disrespectful.

212
00:12:09,337 --> 00:12:11,256
休假怎么樣  給我帶T恤了嗎
How was furlough? Did you bring me back a T-shirt?

213
00:12:13,967 --> 00:12:15,468
真他媽的  妹子
Holy shit, dude.

214
00:12:15,552 --> 00:12:17,220
說什么
Well, what's it say?

215
00:12:17,304 --> 00:12:19,181
慢著  讓我猜猜
Wait, let me guess. 

216
00:12:19,264 --> 00:12:21,975
美女  抱歉我在芝加哥坑了你
"Hey, girl, uh, sorry I fucked you over in Chicago.

217
00:12:22,059 --> 00:12:24,477
那是為你好  我給你舔陰戶吧
It was for your own good. Let me lick your pussy."

218
00:12:24,561 --> 00:12:26,604
可能吧  但我不知道
Probably, but I don't know.

219
00:12:28,273 --> 00:12:30,108
-我還沒看  -什么
- I haven't read it. - What?

220
00:12:30,192 --> 00:12:33,153
老天  你意志真堅定啊
Man, that's some serious willpower right there.

221
00:12:33,236 --> 00:12:34,279
你就不好奇嗎
Aren't you curious?

222
00:12:34,362 --> 00:12:36,949
我當然好奇  這是第一封我沒扔掉的
Of course I'm curious. It's the first one I haven't thrown away.

223
00:12:37,032 --> 00:12:38,575
那就看唄
So, fucking read it already.

224
00:12:38,658 --> 00:12:40,327
-我來  -不用不用
- I'll do it. - No! No, no, no, no, no.

225
00:12:40,410 --> 00:12:42,829
她就是想要這樣
That is exactly what she wants.

226
00:12:42,912 --> 00:12:44,221
對  當人們寄信
Yes, that is generally what

227
00:12:44,222 --> 00:12:46,791
一般就是想讓別人看
people want when they send a piece of correspondence.

228
00:12:46,874 --> 00:12:48,710
她會說些什么我想聽的話
What could she possibly say that I want to hear?

229
00:12:49,919 --> 00:12:51,046
她是個說謊精
She's a liar.

230
00:12:51,129 --> 00:12:53,548
從最開始  她就滿口謊言
She's always been a liar. From the very beginning.

231
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:56,343
難道不是每個人都對每個人說謊嗎
Doesn't everyone lie to everyone?

232
00:12:58,095 --> 00:13:00,350
她知道如果她一直寄信
She knows that if she keeps sending these,

233
00:13:00,351 --> 00:13:01,639
最終會打動我
eventually I will crack,

234
00:13:01,723 --> 00:13:03,308
然后她會道歉
and then she'll apologize,

235
00:13:03,391 --> 00:13:05,935
然后她會滿口仁義  讓她去死
and she'll say all the right things, and fuck that!

236
00:13:06,019 --> 00:13:08,855
但你也不會把信扔掉
But you're not gonna throw it away either.

237
00:13:08,938 --> 00:13:11,733
-你想她  -我當然想她
- You miss her. - Of course I miss her.

238
00:13:11,816 --> 00:13:15,445
我討厭她對我的影響力  我真是煩透了
I hate that she has this hold on me. I'm so sick of it.

239
00:13:17,614 --> 00:13:19,824
麥片味道跟鼻屎一樣
The oatmeal tastes like snot.

240
00:13:19,907 --> 00:13:22,119
我要一杯  要一杯
I'll take a... shot. Shot!

241
00:13:23,786 --> 00:13:26,456
沒關系  我要這個
It's all good. Okay, I got this one.

242
00:13:27,874 --> 00:13:29,292
太差勁了
Oh, that was terrible!

243
00:13:56,028 --> 00:13:58,030
你怎么來了
What are you doing here?

244
00:13:58,113 --> 00:13:59,322
我嘛
Oh, I just, um...

245
00:14:00,615 --> 00:14:03,243
我聽說了艷舞表演
I heard about the burlesque show. 

246
00:14:03,326 --> 00:14:05,370
-你呢  -我朋友瑞秋是演員之一
- You? - My friend Rachel's in it.

247
00:14:05,453 --> 00:14:07,830
她和雷·羅曼諾的木偶一起表演
She does this routine with a Ray Romano puppet.

248
00:14:08,831 --> 00:14:10,417
居然相當性感
It's surprisingly sexy.

249
00:14:18,841 --> 00:14:22,262
那晚的事我很抱歉  帕波
Look, I'm really sorry about that night, Piper.

250
00:14:22,345 --> 00:14:24,431
我不是那種做事遮遮掩掩的人
I'm not a shady person.

251
00:14:24,514 --> 00:14:25,932
算了  沒事的
Oh, come on, don't worry about it.

252
00:14:26,015 --> 00:14:28,288
我以前沒挨過揍
I mean, I've never been punched before.

253
00:14:28,289 --> 00:14:30,562
這可能是很好的人生體驗
It was probably a good life experience.

254
00:14:34,607 --> 00:14:37,194
我說事情很復雜時是認真的
I meant it when I said that things were complicated.

255
00:14:38,695 --> 00:14:41,823
戀愛關系對我來說是新嘗試  我不知道
I'm new to this whole relationship thing. You know, I don't...

256
00:14:42,949 --> 00:14:44,033
我不知道規則
I don't know the rules.

257
00:14:45,202 --> 00:14:47,329
這就是問題所在對嗎
That's the whole problem, isn't it?

258
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:50,290
守規矩一點也不好玩
Rules aren't any fun.

259
00:15:03,386 --> 00:15:06,139
我不想打擾真愛
Listen, I don't want to stand in the way of true love.

260
00:15:06,223 --> 00:15:08,100
如果那位是你未來的妻子
I mean, if that is your future wife out there,

261
00:15:08,183 --> 00:15:10,893
請務必讓我走開
by all means, tell me to back off.

262
00:15:10,977 --> 00:15:15,565
但你追求我  我很喜歡
But you pursued me, and I liked it.

263
00:15:15,648 --> 00:15:16,858
我
I've...

264
00:15:18,235 --> 00:15:19,319
我從未感受過...
I've never felt...

265
00:15:20,862 --> 00:15:22,614
我從未覺得自己是個
You know, I've never really thought of myself

266
00:15:22,697 --> 00:15:24,741
性欲很強的人  但是
as a very sexual person, but...

267
00:15:26,659 --> 00:15:28,578
自從...
ever since...

268
00:15:33,208 --> 00:15:35,252
我想品嘗你的味道
I want to taste what you taste like.

269
00:16:01,986 --> 00:16:03,700
餐廳供應什么  紅媽  
What were they serving in there, Red? 

270
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:05,490
內臟[屈辱]餡餅
Humble pie?

271
00:16:05,573 --> 00:16:07,867
鳥肉[大麻]  生奶油[鞭打]老太太
Crow? Whipped old lady?

272
00:16:07,950 --> 00:16:09,161
一直在練習雙關冷笑話嗎
Been practicing those?

273
00:16:09,244 --> 00:16:11,704
自大漢堡  臉上的雞蛋[恥辱]    
High horse hamburger? Egg on your face?

274
00:16:11,788 --> 00:16:13,682
你吃了你的帽子嗎[說過的話錯了]
Did you eat your hat?

275
00:16:21,506 --> 00:16:22,882
-哥們  -嘿
- Hey, bud. - Hey.

276
00:16:22,965 --> 00:16:25,218
還好不
How you doing?

277
00:16:25,302 --> 00:16:28,971
你那次崩潰后  你那晚哭了沒
Did you cry it out the other night after your little lady meltdown?

278
00:16:29,055 --> 00:16:32,016
拜托  兄弟  放輕松
Oh, come on, man, relax. Shit, loosen up.

279
00:16:32,099 --> 00:16:35,270
就像我媽經常說的  別一臉苦逼樣
It's like my mom used to say, "Wipe that puss off your face."

280
00:16:32,099 --> 00:16:35,270
{\an8}{\fn方正黑體簡體\fs18\b1\bord1\shad1\3c&H2F2F2F&}直譯為"把陰戶從臉上拿開"

281
00:16:35,353 --> 00:16:37,897
當然那是在我意識到  我喜歡臉貼著陰戶前
'Course that was before I learned I liked puss on my face.

282
00:16:39,732 --> 00:16:41,568
又是新的一天  本尼特
It's a new day, Benerino.

283
00:16:44,028 --> 00:16:46,906
這他媽算什么  《獄中號角》
What the fuck is this? The Big House Bugle?

284
00:16:46,989 --> 00:16:49,242
顯然你支持這種犯人宣傳活動
Clearly you supported this prisoner propaganda.

285
00:16:49,326 --> 00:16:51,494
她們為我寫了篇不錯的封面故事
They did a nice cover story on me.

286
00:16:51,578 --> 00:16:52,678
你們這些白癡
And none of you morons

287
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:55,081
沒人看懂漫畫里的那只海象是海利嗎
caught on that the walrus in the comic is Healy?

288
00:16:55,164 --> 00:16:56,583
我覺得很搞笑
I thought it was pretty funny.

289
00:16:56,666 --> 00:16:59,669
你覺得這只穿高跟鞋
And who do you think is the pig in high heels

290
00:16:59,752 --> 00:17:01,546
背著幾包錢的豬是誰
carrying around the bags of money?

291
00:17:02,297 --> 00:17:03,298
真難住我了
You got me there.

292
00:17:08,052 --> 00:17:09,679
這垃圾是誰負責的
Who's in charge of this garbage?

293
00:17:09,762 --> 00:17:12,515
應該是查普曼  犯人主編
That would be Chapman. Inmate-in-chief.

294
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:14,058
我不想再見到這種爛東西
I don't want to see this shit again.

295
00:17:14,141 --> 00:17:15,768
也許你應該重新考慮下
You might want to reconsider.

296
00:17:15,852 --> 00:17:17,645
你會需要全部的新聞宣傳
You can use all the journalistic spin you can get.

297
00:17:17,729 --> 00:17:18,813
為什么
Why?

298
00:17:18,896 --> 00:17:22,734
你最喜歡的強奸犯警衛表現突出
Your favorite rapist guard has exceeded all expectations.

299
00:17:23,735 --> 00:17:25,362
迪亞茨懷孕了
The Diaz girl is pregnant.

300
00:17:26,028 --> 00:17:27,029
你確定嗎
Are you sure?

301
00:17:27,989 --> 00:17:29,031
今天早上做了檢查
Tested her this morning.

302
00:17:29,115 --> 00:17:30,492
上帝
Jesus.

303
00:17:30,575 --> 00:17:32,910
壞壞的孩子他爸
Big, bad baby daddy,

304
00:17:32,994 --> 00:17:35,079
你讓他回來的
and you brought him back.

305
00:17:35,162 --> 00:17:37,415
真他媽的  我得把握住局勢
Fuck me. I gotta get out in front of this.

306
00:17:37,499 --> 00:17:40,960
不能讓門德斯知道這事  等我安排好再說  
Mendez can't know anything until I frame the whole thing.

307
00:17:41,043 --> 00:17:42,337
你讓他繼續工作嗎
You're keeping him at work?

308
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:43,942
等我把事情安排好
Just until I get my ducks in a row.

309
00:17:43,943 --> 00:17:45,465
這事得正確解決
This thing has to be handled right.

310
00:17:47,884 --> 00:17:49,802
你要我為你保守這個秘密
You want me to keep this under wraps,

311
00:17:49,803 --> 00:17:51,929
你就得為我做點事
you're gonna have to do something for me.

312
00:17:52,013 --> 00:17:53,681
什么
What?

313
00:17:53,765 --> 00:17:55,224
到時候
When it's time...

314
00:17:56,225 --> 00:17:57,769
我來炒掉這個雜種
I get to fire the bastard.

315
00:17:59,312 --> 00:18:00,438
好
Fine.

316
00:18:02,231 --> 00:18:03,608
為什么是俄國人
So, why a Russian?

317
00:18:03,691 --> 00:18:06,611
我不知道  我只是
I don't know. I just...

318
00:18:06,694 --> 00:18:08,195
我做了些網上調查
I did some online research,

319
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:10,948
發現最受歡迎的郵購網站
and I found that the top-rated mail order sites

320
00:18:11,032 --> 00:18:14,619
不是東歐就是東方的  所以
were either Eastern European or Oriental, so...

321
00:18:14,702 --> 00:18:18,122
我覺得和俄國人少些文化障礙
I figured there'd be less cultural barriers with the Russians.

322
00:18:18,205 --> 00:18:21,501
有金錢交易嗎
And there was money exchanged?

323
00:18:21,584 --> 00:18:23,169
對不起  我對這個不熟
I'm sorry, I'm not familiar with...

324
00:18:23,252 --> 00:18:25,672
我不需要你對我品頭論足
You know, I don't... I don't need your judgment, okay?

325
00:18:25,755 --> 00:18:27,340
因為就所見而言
'Cause from the looks of it, you know,

326
00:18:27,424 --> 00:18:29,384
我想你的愛情生活也不怎么樣
I'm guessing your love life isn't so hot either.

327
00:18:29,467 --> 00:18:33,220
也許你把你的經歷投射到我身上  山姆
Perhaps you're projecting your experiences onto me, Sam.

328
00:18:33,305 --> 00:18:35,056
少說些心理學廢話
Let's cut the fucking psychobabble, okay?

329
00:18:35,139 --> 00:18:37,975
我的老婆是我買來的  他媽的又怎樣
I have a wife that I paid for. So fucking what?

330
00:18:38,059 --> 00:18:40,590
我不需要你搬出這些教課書術語
I don't need you going around throwing out these textbook

331
00:18:40,591 --> 00:18:42,647
就像那些有優越感的偽百事通一樣
terms like some condescending know-it-all.

332
00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:45,317
我也是靠這個吃飯的
This is what I do for a living, too.

333
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:46,859
我是個輔導員
I'm a counselor.

334
00:18:47,735 --> 00:18:49,362
你為什么來這里
Why did you come here?

335
00:18:49,446 --> 00:18:51,739
我他媽的也不知道為什么來這里
You know, I don't fucking know why I came here.

336
00:18:51,823 --> 00:18:53,991
因為我他媽的不需要你的幫助
Because I don't need your fucking help.

337
00:18:54,075 --> 00:18:56,202
因為我才是幫助他人的人
Because I'm the one that's helping people.

338
00:18:56,285 --> 00:18:58,162
日復一日
All day long.

339
00:18:58,245 --> 00:18:59,664
是嗎
Do you?

340
00:19:00,957 --> 00:19:02,334
你真的幫助了他人嗎
Do you really help people?

341
00:19:03,626 --> 00:19:05,670
他媽的當然了
You bet your ass I do.

342
00:19:07,589 --> 00:19:10,174
老天  這些發辮癢死了
Man, these tracks itching something fierce.

343
00:19:10,257 --> 00:19:13,595
我得把這些給維  讓她能散出去給她的人
I gotta get these to Vee so she can get 'em out to her people.

344
00:19:13,678 --> 00:19:15,888
寄郵票需要多少郵票
How many stamps do you need to send stamps?

345
00:19:15,972 --> 00:19:17,724
你有時間嗎
Yo, you got a second?

346
00:19:20,602 --> 00:19:22,186
我知道你們在販毒
I know y'all are dealing.

347
00:19:22,269 --> 00:19:23,813
那又如何
Yeah, so?

348
00:19:23,896 --> 00:19:25,648
你對我說謊  T
So, you lied to me, T.

349
00:19:25,732 --> 00:19:27,400
說得你好像沒賣過毒品一樣
Like you never sold drugs.

350
00:19:27,484 --> 00:19:28,818
我賣的是大麻  不是那些害人的
I sold weed. Not real shit.

351
00:19:28,901 --> 00:19:31,529
害人到足夠把你關在這里了
Real enough to get your ass locked in here.

352
00:19:31,613 --> 00:19:33,906
別這么假清高
So don't be acting all high siddity.

353
00:19:33,990 --> 00:19:36,198
怕你沒注意到  
In case you ain't noticed, 

354
00:19:36,198 --> 00:19:39,203
這里全是罪犯
this place is full of criminals.

355
00:19:39,286 --> 00:19:40,913
我們也是其中兩個
And we're two of 'em.

356
00:19:40,997 --> 00:19:43,332
加那邊的瘋子有三個罪犯
Three, if you include cuckoo over here.

357
00:19:43,416 --> 00:19:46,544
咱們有錢賺吶
Yo, we's getting paid, man.

358
00:19:46,628 --> 00:19:49,547
咱們幫萬歲  警察去死
Our crew rules. Fuck the police!

359
00:19:49,631 --> 00:19:51,758
現在你們全成了黑幫分子嗎
Oh, what, now you all gangster?

360
00:19:51,841 --> 00:19:53,510
你們全他媽被洗腦了
Man, y'all are fucking brainwashed.

361
00:19:53,593 --> 00:19:55,219
你嫉妒了
You're jealous.

362
00:19:55,302 --> 00:19:59,223
嫉妒什么  你像個欺負人的小混混嗎
Jealous of what? You acting like a hood rat corner kid?

363
00:20:00,057 --> 00:20:02,143
你不知道我的出身
You don't know where I come from.

364
00:20:02,226 --> 00:20:06,105
我沒有老爸在軍隊  沒父母管我
I ain't have no daddy in the army, parents looking out for me,

365
00:20:06,188 --> 00:20:09,776
沒有棉衣  你這個有錢人家的賤人
and a fucking winter coat, you bougie bitch.

366
00:20:09,859 --> 00:20:12,278
別假裝你了解我和我的人
So don't pretend like you know me or my people.

367
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:15,072
我以為你不想墮落到如此地步
I thought you wanted to be better than that.

368
00:20:18,034 --> 00:20:19,368
滾出我的鋪位
Get the fuck out of my bunk.

369
00:20:21,704 --> 00:20:23,122
臨時檢查
Yo, it's a sweep.

370
00:20:23,205 --> 00:20:25,041
他們臨時檢查
They sweeping. 

371
00:20:26,042 --> 00:20:27,126
快走  女士們
Let's go, ladies!

372
00:20:27,209 --> 00:20:30,212
犯人們  立刻離開鋪位
Inmates, outside your bunks, now!

373
00:20:30,296 --> 00:20:31,839
全部不準動
Don't move a muscle.

374
00:20:32,632 --> 00:20:34,967
讓我看到你們吞什么藏什么
I see you swallow anything or tuck anything away,

375
00:20:35,051 --> 00:20:36,553
就等著關禁閉吧
your ass goes to the box.

376
00:20:43,059 --> 00:20:45,005
我想左邊拔得太夸張了對嗎
I think I did the left side too much. Right? 

377
00:20:45,006 --> 00:20:46,479
眉彎太高了嗎
The arch is too high?

378
00:20:46,563 --> 00:20:47,494
看起來
Eh, it kind of looks like

379
00:20:47,495 --> 00:20:49,023
你這人疑神疑鬼的
you're really skeptical about everything.

380
00:20:49,106 --> 00:20:51,150
我覺得狡猾的樣子挺性感的
I think the leery look is hot, you know?

381
00:20:51,233 --> 00:20:52,735
-A區宿舍  臨時檢查  -媽的
- A-Dorm! Sweep time! - Fuck!

382
00:20:52,819 --> 00:20:54,987
他們會拿走我的唇膏
They're gonna take my lipstick.

383
00:20:55,071 --> 00:20:57,364
臨時檢查  女士們
Sweep time, ladies!

384
00:20:57,449 --> 00:20:58,450
媽的
Fuck!

385
00:21:02,662 --> 00:21:04,038
真他媽的
Shit! Son of a...

386
00:21:08,209 --> 00:21:09,586
犯人  出去
Inmate, outside!

387

非法食品  記一筆
Illegal foodstuffs. That's a shot.

388
00:21:20,137 --> 00:21:22,849
指甲油  鋒利鑷子
Nail polish. Sharp tweezers.

389
00:21:22,932 --> 00:21:24,433
你的通話時間沒有了  犯人
There goes your phone time, inmate.

390
00:21:30,106 --> 00:21:31,107
中大獎了
Jackpot!

391
00:21:31,774 --> 00:21:34,193
恐怕這個可不是超強吸引性衛生棉條
I doubt these are super absorbent, huh?

392
00:21:34,276 --> 00:21:36,571
這是誰的床鋪  沃森  
Whose bunk is this? Watson.

393
00:21:38,615 --> 00:21:40,366
這些小卷賣多少錢
How much these little rollies going for, huh?

394
00:21:40,449 --> 00:21:42,076
給自己找了點買賣嗎
Got yourself a little business?

395
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:43,202
沒有  長官
No, sir.

396
00:21:43,285 --> 00:21:44,621
別跟我說什么沒有
Don't you "No, sir" me!

397
00:21:44,704 --> 00:21:47,832
快把你的黑屁股挪到禁閉室去
You start marching your pretty black ass to the SHU.

398
00:21:47,915 --> 00:21:49,876
我知道你有多喜歡那里
I know how much you love it in there.

399
00:21:49,959 --> 00:21:51,418
快走
Move!

400
00:21:55,632 --> 00:21:57,466
給我
I'll take that.

401
00:22:13,691 --> 00:22:15,317
你收到了我的卡
You have my card.

402
00:22:17,654 --> 00:22:19,822
孩子們很可愛對嗎
Kids are cute, right? 

403
00:22:20,823 --> 00:22:24,493
另一張準備買的卡是一只貓說"你喵完美"
It was between this or some cats that said, "You're purr-fect!"

404
00:22:26,162 --> 00:22:27,163
是的
Yeah.

405
00:22:28,956 --> 00:22:31,500
我的選擇是正確的
I made the right choice.

406
00:22:37,173 --> 00:22:38,257
你看起來不同了
You look so different.

407
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:41,052
不知怎的更溫柔了  這是好事
Softer somehow. In a good way.

408
00:22:52,814 --> 00:22:54,774
我讓你留著這個
I'm gonna let you keep that.

409
00:23:01,739 --> 00:23:03,032
沒發現
Clear!

410
00:23:06,493 --> 00:23:07,954
老天  瞧這一堆
Jesus, what a haul!

411
00:23:08,037 --> 00:23:11,791
把這個撕開檢查毒品后我就帶它回家
I'm taking this home after I rip it open to check for drugs.

412
00:23:11,874 --> 00:23:13,125
好可愛
It's adorable.

413
00:23:13,209 --> 00:23:13,946
看這些東西
Look at all this stuff.

414
00:23:13,947 --> 00:23:15,294
顯然是有門路弄進來的
There are some serious open channels here.

415
00:23:15,377 --> 00:23:16,462
你聞一下
Here, smell this, would ya?

416
00:23:16,545 --> 00:23:18,547
好難聞
Whoa, that's awful.

417
00:23:18,631 --> 00:23:19,632
聞一下
Smell it.

418
00:23:19,716 --> 00:23:21,508
大便味
Oh, it smells like poo.

419
00:23:21,593 --> 00:23:22,802
全聞起來是大便味
Yeah, it all smells like poo.

420
00:23:22,885 --> 00:23:24,386
知道這意味著什么嗎
You know what that means?

421
00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:26,681
全是通過直腸弄進來的
It's all coming in through the rectal pipeline.

422
00:23:28,057 --> 00:23:31,227
下蹲咳嗽檢查太松懈了
Someone has been slacking with the squat and cough.

423
00:23:32,103 --> 00:23:33,354
知道這意味著什么嗎
You know what this means?

424
00:23:33,437 --> 00:23:35,815
光看已經不夠了  得開始捅了
It's not enough to look, we gotta start probing.

425
00:23:35,898 --> 00:23:37,358
不能碰她們  這是違法的
We can't touch 'em. It's illegal.

426
00:23:37,441 --> 00:23:38,776
我可不會把胳膊伸過去
I'm not sticking my arm up there.

427
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:40,737
那么伸手指呢  有什么不行
What about a finger? What's wrong with that?

428
00:23:41,904 --> 00:23:43,072
偶爾伸根手指感覺不錯啊
A finger's nice once in a while.

429
00:23:43,155 --> 00:23:45,532
只能目測
Visual inspections only.

430
00:23:45,617 --> 00:23:48,202
小小的指頭  拜托
Tiny little finger? Come on.

431
00:23:48,285 --> 00:23:51,998
我不知道你們  但我準備好做英雄了
I don't know about you all, but I'm ready to be the hero.

432
00:23:52,081 --> 00:23:53,833
沒什么能逃過我
Nothing's getting past me.

433
00:23:53,916 --> 00:23:56,502
你看的和你想的不一樣  就這樣了
You didn't see what you thought you saw, end of story.

434
00:23:56,585 --> 00:23:59,171
-那是什么  -老天  有完沒完
- What was it, then? - Oh, Jesus, really?

435
00:23:59,255 --> 00:24:00,923
我不會就此罷休的
Look, I'm not gonna leave you alone.

436
00:24:01,007 --> 00:24:03,009
我什么也沒做
I'm not doing anything.

437
00:24:03,092 --> 00:24:04,468
你要和我一起去廁所嗎
Do you wanna join me in the bathroom?

438
00:24:04,551 --> 00:24:06,470
我要去那里  去拉屎
'Cause that's where I'm headed. To take a dump.

439
00:24:06,553 --> 00:24:08,681
來吧  你可以把紙折整齊了給我
Come on, you can hand me neatly folded squares of paper

440
00:24:08,765 --> 00:24:10,767
就好像你是宮廷侍從官  我是亨利八世
like you're the groom of the stole and I'm Henry VIII.

441
00:24:17,732 --> 00:24:19,942
你給你今天的心理狀態打幾分
Well, how would you rate your state of mind today?

442
00:24:20,985 --> 00:24:22,236
4嗎
A four?

443
00:24:22,319 --> 00:24:26,365
你有沒有憤怒的想法  這種想法定期出現嗎
You having any angry thoughts? They coming up regularly for you?

444
00:24:27,616 --> 00:24:31,078
你有沒有憤怒的想法  這種想法定期出現嗎
Are you having angry thoughts that are coming up regularly?

445
00:24:31,162 --> 00:24:32,579
這是投射
That's projection.

446
00:24:32,664 --> 00:24:33,790
什么意思
What does that mean?

447
00:24:34,749 --> 00:24:37,043
你知道我是靠什么維生嗎  我的工作是什么
You have any idea what I do for a living? What my job is?

448
00:24:37,126 --> 00:24:38,210
我當然知道
Of course I do.

449
00:24:38,294 --> 00:24:42,631
你為那些記過的女士們填寫相關文件
You fill out the paperworks for the ladies that get shots.

450
00:24:45,134 --> 00:24:46,719
我提供指導
I provide guidance.

451
00:24:47,887 --> 00:24:49,847
我就人們的問題提出忠告
I counsel people with their problems.

452
00:24:52,850 --> 00:24:55,728
我想創辦一個支持小組
I'm thinking about starting a support group.

453
00:24:55,812 --> 00:24:57,229
開展心理治療
It's a therapy thing.

454
00:24:58,314 --> 00:25:00,066
我覺得對這里的女性有幫助
I think the women here could really use it.

455
00:25:00,149 --> 00:25:02,902
這里有些愛生氣的賤人
There are some angry bitches around here.

456
00:25:04,070 --> 00:25:05,362
但如果沒有好處
But you know that ain't nobody gonna do nothing

457
00:25:05,446 --> 00:25:07,406
是沒人會理的
without getting something from it.

458
00:25:07,489 --> 00:25:09,658
她們會有收獲的
They will be getting something.

459
00:25:10,743 --> 00:25:12,244
對她們的問題有幫助
Help with their problems.

460
00:25:12,328 --> 00:25:16,874
不  我是說比如免費甜甜圈  不用干活
No, I'm talking about, like, free donuts, or days off work.

461
00:25:16,958 --> 00:25:20,002
我印了些傳單
I've, uh, printed out some flyers.

462
00:25:21,503 --> 00:25:23,255
我想要你發出去
I'd like you to distribute them.

463
00:25:25,216 --> 00:25:26,508
好的  海利先生  
All right, Mr. Healy,

464
00:25:26,592 --> 00:25:29,095
但我告訴你  沒人會來的
but I'm telling you, no one's gonna come on their own.

465
00:25:29,178 --> 00:25:31,848
你低估了她們
You're underestimating them.

466
00:25:31,931 --> 00:25:34,475
這些女性經歷了太多
These women have been through a lot.

467
00:25:34,558 --> 00:25:35,852
她們會來的
They'll come.

468
00:25:47,113 --> 00:25:50,157
沒想到你們會對文學有興趣
Didn't realize y'all had such literary interests.

469
00:25:50,241 --> 00:25:52,618
我們希望你能給些建議
Yeah, well, we were hoping you could make a few suggestions.

470
00:25:52,701 --> 00:25:55,412
因為我聽說  你這個人很會提意見
'Cause from what I hear, you're quite the little critic.

471
00:25:56,372 --> 00:25:57,999
-我有些想法  -是嗎
- Yeah, I got some thoughts. - Yeah?

472
00:25:58,082 --> 00:25:59,250
還有些問題
Yeah, and some questions.

473
00:25:59,333 --> 00:26:01,794
你為什么讓珍娜被關了禁閉
Like why you let my girl Janae get dragged off to seg.

474
00:26:01,878 --> 00:26:05,131
她應該明白不能把違禁品放在鋪位上
Well, she knew better than to keep contraband in her bunk.

475
00:26:06,548 --> 00:26:09,051
現在她有許多獨處的時間來考慮這個問題
Guess she got a lot of alone time now to think about it.

476
00:26:09,135 --> 00:26:12,054
她不會有事的  只要她只想不出聲
She'll be fine, so long as she thinks and doesn't speak.

477
00:26:16,517 --> 00:26:18,035
你到底入不入伙  
You in or out? 

478
00:26:18,036 --> 00:26:20,229
圖書館對我們來說是個好地方
The library is prime real estate for us.

479
00:26:22,023 --> 00:26:24,483
你有地盤了  別在這里交易
Look, you got your spot. Deal out of there.

480
00:26:24,566 --> 00:26:27,820
女囚們扎堆去倉庫是說不通的
There's no reason for the inmates to flow through the warehouse.

481
00:26:27,904 --> 00:26:29,822
連看看都是不對勁的
There's no excuse to browse.

482
00:26:29,906 --> 00:26:31,740
而且  警衛已經嗅到了血腥味  
Plus, the hacks got a taste of blood.

483
00:26:31,824 --> 00:26:34,243
他們檢查所有的工作地點只是時間問題
It's only a matter of time before they sweep all the work sites.

484
00:26:36,078 --> 00:26:37,371
我不是小混混
I ain't no corner girl.

485
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:41,167
我喜歡這個地點
I like this spot.

486
00:26:42,459 --> 00:26:46,547
所以你要么聽話  要么要求調職
So you either get your ass in line or request a transfer.

487
00:26:46,630 --> 00:26:48,340
我聽說電工那邊在招人
I hear Electrical is looking.

488
00:26:49,591 --> 00:26:51,260
明白嗎
You feel me?

489
00:26:53,054 --> 00:26:54,513
我哪里也不去
I ain't going nowhere.

490
00:26:55,681 --> 00:26:57,391
明白嗎
You feel me?

491
00:27:05,482 --> 00:27:07,734
迪亞茨女士  我們只是需要口頭確認
Miss Diaz, we just need verbal confirmation

492
00:27:07,819 --> 00:27:11,530
門德斯警官強暴了你  你能說出來嗎
that Officer Mendez forced himself on you. Can you provide that?

493
00:27:11,613 --> 00:27:12,614
你沒看到嗎
Didn't you see it?

494
00:27:15,492 --> 00:27:17,494
這是為了文書工作
This is for our paperwork.

495
00:27:19,121 --> 00:27:20,998
喬  如果你不在這里
Joe, I think Miss Diaz would be more comfortable

496
00:27:21,082 --> 00:27:22,583
我想迪亞茨女士會自在些
if you weren't in the room.

497
00:27:36,097 --> 00:27:38,682
有法律規定
Look, there are laws in place

498
00:27:38,765 --> 00:27:42,269
犯人與監獄工作人員的性愛是非法的
which criminalize sex between prisoners and prison staff.

499
00:27:42,353 --> 00:27:45,731
這意味著工作人員有性愛不當行為時
Which means that employees who engage in sexual misconduct

500
00:27:45,814 --> 00:27:48,692
不能將對方同意作為辯護借口
cannot claim consent as a defense.

501
00:27:48,775 --> 00:27:50,611
所以正式來說這是強奸
So, officially it's a rape,

502
00:27:50,612 --> 00:27:53,197
沒錯  我們會這么說
yes, and we're all gonna call it that.

503
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:55,407
但我需要知道  女人對女人
But I need to know, girl-to-girl...

504
00:27:56,242 --> 00:27:57,243
是你情我愿的嗎
was it consensual?

505
00:27:59,453 --> 00:28:02,539
我明白  你孤單  你想調調情
Listen, I get it. You're lonely, you want to flirt a little.

506
00:28:02,623 --> 00:28:04,458
引起警衛的注意令你覺得很特別
Attention from a guard makes you feel special.

507
00:28:04,541 --> 00:28:07,044
僅是那身制服就讓人有性趣對嗎
I mean, those uniforms alone can be a real turn-on, right?

508
00:28:08,170 --> 00:28:09,708
就咱們之間說清楚  
So, just between us, 

509
00:28:09,708 --> 00:28:12,466
我要知道你是否鼓勵了他
I need to know if you encouraged him.

510
00:28:15,970 --> 00:28:17,846
-是的  -我想也是
- Yes. - I thought as much.

511
00:28:20,057 --> 00:28:22,851
你真給我惹了大麻煩  小姑娘
Well, you've created quite a headache for me, young lady.

512
00:28:22,935 --> 00:28:24,985
現在我不僅要對你負責
And now not only am I responsible for you,

513
00:28:24,986 --> 00:28:26,939
還要對你肚中的胎負責
but for your little spawn of the system.

514
00:28:27,023 --> 00:28:28,524
所以幫個忙  親愛的
So, do me a favor, sweetheart,

515
00:28:28,607 --> 00:28:31,693
從現在開始  把你的雙腿閉緊
from now on, keep your legs closed.

516
00:28:33,237 --> 00:28:34,488
恭喜你
Congratulations.

517
00:28:34,571 --> 00:28:37,449
你正式毀了一個男人的生活
You've officially destroyed a man's life.

518
00:28:40,661 --> 00:28:43,915
不  你得告訴她  如果銀行周日關門  
No, you gotta tell her that if the bank is closed on Sunday,

519
00:28:43,998 --> 00:28:46,583
那么周一早上給她錢就他媽的沒有滯納金
that there's no fucking late fee if you pay her Monday morning.

520
00:28:46,667 --> 00:28:48,794
-這種屁話不對  -我說了
- That shit's not right. - I did.

521
00:28:48,877 --> 00:28:50,004
她依然要收你錢嗎
And she's still trying to charge you?

522
00:28:50,087 --> 00:28:51,297
是的
Mmm-hmm.

523
00:28:51,380 --> 00:28:53,966
你要這樣做
Okay, so here's what you gotta do.

524
00:28:54,050 --> 00:28:55,259
你找根棒球棒
You get a baseball bat,

525
00:28:55,342 --> 00:28:58,720
木頭的  不要金屬的
the wood kind, not the fucking metal kind,

526
00:28:58,804 --> 00:29:01,307
一個大垃圾袋
and a big trash bag,

527
00:29:01,390 --> 00:29:04,476
黑色的  不要看得透那種
the black kind, not the see-through kind...

528
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:07,438
邁克爾  你長大了
Michael, you look all grown up.

529
00:29:07,521 --> 00:29:09,648
你一定長高了有4英寸
You must have grown, like, 4 inches.

530
00:29:09,731 --> 00:29:11,108
現在叫邁克了
It's "Mike" now.

531
00:29:14,445 --> 00:29:16,238
看看他的腳
Now, take a look at his feet.

532
00:29:16,322 --> 00:29:19,408
我告訴他  他躺下去和站著一樣高
I told him he's as tall lying down as he is standing up.

533
00:29:22,869 --> 00:29:25,664
你想對我說什么
Anything you want to say to me...

534
00:29:27,791 --> 00:29:29,543
都可以  明白嗎
you can say it, okay?

535
00:29:35,757 --> 00:29:38,760
也許我們應該玩游戲  好嗎
Well, you know, maybe we should play a game. Hmm?

536
00:29:39,761 --> 00:29:43,515
那邊小孩用品里有撲克牌  怎么樣
They got a deck of cards over there by the kids' stuff. Huh?

537
00:29:47,394 --> 00:29:50,564
在探視室  可以擁抱兩次
When in the Visitation Room, you're allowed two hugs,

538
00:29:50,647 --> 00:29:52,816
到達和離開時分別一次
one on arrival and one on departure.

539
00:29:52,899 --> 00:29:55,611
衛生間還沒修好
Well, they still didn't fix the bathrooms,

540
00:29:55,694 --> 00:29:57,821
湖邊應該建擋土
and they were supposed to put in a retaining wall by the lake,

541
00:29:57,904 --> 00:29:59,615
但現在只有幾包沙袋
but there's just a couple of sandbags.

542
00:29:59,698 --> 00:30:01,867
我查了FCP這個名字  并不存在
Well, I ran the name FCP and it doesn't exist.

543
00:30:01,950 --> 00:30:03,452
查不到這家公司
No trace of the company.

544
00:30:03,535 --> 00:30:04,953
你確定在卡車上看到的是這個名字嗎
You sure that's the name you saw on the truck?

545
00:30:05,037 --> 00:30:06,038
對  我肯定
Yeah, I'm positive.

546
00:30:06,122 --> 00:30:07,748
我猜想
Well, my guess is that the

547
00:30:07,749 --> 00:30:10,751
監獄給合同的公司
prison is giving inflated contracts to companies

548
00:30:10,834 --> 00:30:13,045
要么是空殼公司  要么是菲茨核心的下屬公司
that are either shells or subsidiaries of FitzCORE,

549
00:30:13,129 --> 00:30:14,342
菲茨核心將回扣
and FitzCORE is paying

550
00:30:14,343 --> 00:30:16,715
給杰森·菲格羅亞的競選
kickbacks into the Jason Figueroa campaign.

551
00:30:16,798 --> 00:30:20,802
我需要的是發票  我能看出誰在拿錢
What I need are invoices, so I can see who's getting paid.

552
00:30:22,513 --> 00:30:23,805
是哦
Right.

553
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:26,558
不如這樣
Well, what about...

554
00:30:26,642 --> 00:30:28,394
不如拍些未完成品的照片
What about photos of all the unfinished work?

555
00:30:28,477 --> 00:30:29,728
如果我能給你弄部相機
If I could get you a camera...

556
00:30:29,811 --> 00:30:32,481
不  不如你給我弄部蘋果手機
No, why don't you get me an iPhone

557
00:30:32,564 --> 00:30:35,109
這樣我能拍照  還能玩"糖果大爆險"
so then I can take pictures and play Candy Crush?

558
00:30:35,192 --> 00:30:36,735
你瘋了嗎
Are you insane?

559
00:30:36,818 --> 00:30:37,819
我之前跟你說過了
I told you before,

560
00:30:37,903 --> 00:30:40,447
我不會以自由為代價  為你的署名文章冒險
I'm not risking my freedom for your fucking byline.

561
00:30:40,531 --> 00:30:42,366
帕波  這個女人是罪犯
Piper, this woman is a criminal.

562
00:30:42,449 --> 00:30:44,326
是嗎  我也是
Yeah? Well, so am I.

563
00:30:45,286 --> 00:30:46,578
要二嗎
Collecting twos?

564
00:30:47,496 --> 00:30:48,497
不要
Nope.

565
00:30:51,167 --> 00:30:53,169
對我有用
Better for me.

566
00:30:54,795 --> 00:30:55,796
你確定嗎
You sure about that?

567
00:31:01,427 --> 00:31:02,928
你把我打得落花流水
You're kicking my ass here.

568
00:31:03,011 --> 00:31:05,431
對  到我發牌了
Yep. My turn to deal.

569
00:31:12,354 --> 00:31:13,855
謝謝
Thank you.

570
00:31:15,316 --> 00:31:17,943
南斯先生  你怎么來了
Mr. Nance, what brings you here?

571
00:31:18,026 --> 00:31:20,779
菲格羅亞女士  你好嗎
Miss Figueroa, how are you?

572
00:31:20,862 --> 00:31:22,781
知道你來我監獄做什么我會更好
Better once I know what the fuck you're doing in my prison.

573
00:31:22,864 --> 00:31:24,866
我來探視一位朋友
I was... visiting a friend.

574
00:31:24,950 --> 00:31:26,077
那位朋友是誰
And what friend might that be?

575
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:27,661
我給你的辦公室打過幾個電話
You know, I've called your office a bunch of times.

576
00:31:27,744 --> 00:31:29,163
是嗎
Have you?

577
00:31:29,246 --> 00:31:32,374
我五秒鐘就能找出你在誰的探視名單上
I can find out whose list you're on in five seconds flat,

578
00:31:32,458 --> 00:31:34,335
沒必要玩游戲
so there's no need to play games here.

579
00:31:35,086 --> 00:31:36,170
帕波·查普曼
Piper Chapman.

580
00:31:37,213 --> 00:31:39,256
帕波·查普曼  你怎么認識她的
Piper Chapman. And how do you know Piper Chapman?

581
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:41,925
我們有共同的朋友
We have... mutual friends.

582
00:31:56,232 --> 00:31:58,024
你看到這爛人了嗎
You seeing this shit?

583
00:31:58,109 --> 00:31:59,901
就好像他媽的看上我一樣
I mean, it's like she's got a fucking hit out on me.

584
00:31:59,985 --> 00:32:03,989
我想她要你的芝士泡芙
I think she wants some of those cheese puffs you got.

585
00:32:04,072 --> 00:32:05,366
給她一點吧
Maybe just give her a few.

586
00:32:05,449 --> 00:32:08,744
一定是這樣  她看上我的泡芙了
Oh, yeah, that must be it. She's after my puffs.

587
00:32:09,911 --> 00:32:11,761
莫里洛  你有探視者  
Morello, you have a visitor. 

588
00:32:11,762 --> 00:32:13,457
到探視室報到  莫里洛
Report to Visitation, Morello.

589
00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:14,875
是你啊  妹子
That's you, kid.

590
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:20,339
應該沒人來看我啊  也許是我的妹妹
I'm not expecting anybody. Maybe it's my sister.

591
00:32:20,422 --> 00:32:22,716
老天  希望沒出事  我樣子如何
Jeez, I hope there's nothing wrong. How do I look?

592
00:32:23,967 --> 00:32:25,469
-漂亮  -好的
- Looking hot. - All right.

593
00:32:29,890 --> 00:32:31,933
你夠了
Stop!

594
00:32:32,017 --> 00:32:34,145
至少進來讓我可以看到你
Man, or at least get in here where I can see you.

595
00:32:36,397 --> 00:32:38,106
你打算做這種無聊事做多久
How much longer is this shit gonna go on for?

596
00:32:38,190 --> 00:32:39,691
你要拿去給紅媽
You need to take it to Red.

597
00:32:40,692 --> 00:32:41,693
我不知道你在說什么
I don't know what you're talking about.

598
00:32:44,780 --> 00:32:46,215
你真覺得我會為了嗨一次
You really think I'm gonna throw

599
00:32:46,216 --> 00:32:48,325
丟掉兩年的戒毒成果嗎
away two years of sobriety for one little high?

600
00:32:48,409 --> 00:32:51,203
我看到崔希婭被裝在運尸袋中被運出去
I saw Tricia get wheeled out of here in a body bag.

601
00:32:51,287 --> 00:32:52,871
你覺得我有多蠢
How stupid do you think I am?

602
00:33:09,471 --> 00:33:10,514
你好
Well, hello. Hi.

603
00:33:10,597 --> 00:33:12,015
別碰我
Don't you fucking touch me.

604
00:33:13,975 --> 00:33:15,311
坐下
Sit down.

605
00:33:19,815 --> 00:33:22,943
很高興見到你  我喜歡你的毛衣
It's nice to see you. I like your sweater.

606
00:33:23,026 --> 00:33:24,236
聽我說
Listen to me.

607
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:25,404
我知道你闖進了我家
I know you broke into my house.

608
00:33:25,487 --> 00:33:28,156
我不知道你如何做到的  但你做到了
I don't know how you did it, but you did.

609
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:30,326
警察不相信我  但我知道是你
Now, the cops don't believe me, but I know it was you.

610
00:33:30,409 --> 00:33:32,244
我不明白  你為什么來這里
I don't understand. Why did you come here?

611
00:33:32,328 --> 00:33:33,787
因為我要聽你承認
Because I want to hear you say it.

612
00:33:33,870 --> 00:33:36,457
-告訴我是你  -我不知道你在說些什么
- Tell me it was you. - I don't know what you're talking about.

613
00:33:36,540 --> 00:33:38,584
顯然你坐牢這段時間
So, clearly your time in prison

614
00:33:38,667 --> 00:33:42,087
并沒有讓你回歸現實  你這個瘋子
has done nothing to bring you back into reality, you psycho.

615
00:33:43,171 --> 00:33:44,673
我對天發誓
I swear to God...

616
00:33:44,756 --> 00:33:49,428
如果你再接近我  或是我的家人我的妻子
if you come near me, or my family, or my wife again, ever,

617
00:33:49,511 --> 00:33:50,596
我會殺了你
I will kill you.

618
00:33:50,679 --> 00:33:53,890
我會用雙手  活活掐死你
With my bare fucking hands, I will choke you until you are dead.

619
00:33:55,016 --> 00:33:56,768
你能小點聲音嗎
Could you keep your voice down just a little?

620
00:33:56,852 --> 00:33:58,770
你有病嗎  為什么
You... Are you out of... Why?

621
00:33:58,854 --> 00:33:59,602
你讓我小點聲
You want me to keep my voice down 

622
00:33:59,603 --> 00:34:02,190
這樣你的罪犯朋友不會知道
so your criminal friends in here won't know that you're a

623
00:34:02,191 --> 00:34:04,276
你是個瘋子  越獄跟蹤我嗎
mental case who broke out of prison to stalk me?

624
00:34:06,862 --> 00:34:07,863
是他嗎
Is that him?

625
00:34:10,073 --> 00:34:11,658
什么意思
What is that?

626
00:34:11,742 --> 00:34:14,828
你要繼續玩這種瘋子把戲嗎
Are you trying to keep up this lunatic charade?

627
00:34:14,911 --> 00:34:17,539
-假裝我是你男友嗎  -不是
- Pretend that I'm your boyfriend? - No.

628
00:34:21,710 --> 00:34:24,045
我不認識這個女人  明白嗎
I don't know this woman, okay?

629
00:34:24,129 --> 00:34:26,591
我們約會過一次  就一次  
We went on one date! One! 

630
00:34:26,592 --> 00:34:28,174
她是個該死的跟蹤狂
She's a fucking stalker!

631
00:34:28,259 --> 00:34:30,761
先生  請馬上離開
Sir, you need to leave now.

632
00:34:30,844 --> 00:34:32,804
她是個危險人物
She's fucking dangerous!

633
00:34:32,888 --> 00:34:33,930
-馬上離開  -她...
- Leave, now. - Hey... She...

634
00:34:34,014 --> 00:34:36,892
你知道她越獄了吧
You know she broke out of here, right?

635
00:34:36,975 --> 00:34:38,310
她是個瘋婊子
She's a psycho bitch!

636
00:34:38,394 --> 00:34:39,978
-對不起  -快走
- Sorry. - Come on.

637
00:34:40,061 --> 00:34:42,523
我可不是有罪的那個
Hey, man, I'm not the criminal here, okay?

638
00:35:01,082 --> 00:35:02,083
我瘋了
I'm crazy.

639
00:35:03,294 --> 00:35:07,881
我是個瘋子  我真的很有問題
I'm a crazy person. There is something really wrong with me.

640
00:35:07,964 --> 00:35:10,008
我們所有人都有問題
I mean, there's something wrong with all of us.

641
00:35:10,091 --> 00:35:11,635
否則我們不會在這里
Like, otherwise we wouldn't be in here.

642
00:35:11,718 --> 00:35:15,514
不  我做了壞事
No, I did something bad.

643
00:35:15,597 --> 00:35:16,598
非常壞
Really bad.

644
00:35:16,682 --> 00:35:19,685
我應該待在醫院時
When I was supposed to be at the hospital,

645
00:35:19,768 --> 00:35:21,886
我偷了車  
I stole the van 

646
00:35:21,887 --> 00:35:25,065
去了他奧爾巴尼的家
and I went to his house in Albany.

647
00:35:25,148 --> 00:35:26,608
你說真的嗎
Are you serious?

648
00:35:29,235 --> 00:35:31,697
你知道如果你被抓的話會有什么后果嗎
Do you know what could happen if you got caught?

649
00:35:31,780 --> 00:35:33,532
我想他們會控告你重罪潛逃
I think they charge you with felony escape.

650
00:35:33,615 --> 00:35:34,908
刑期延長三倍
Triple your sentence.

651
00:35:34,991 --> 00:35:37,828
我知道  相信我  我知道
I know. Believe me, I know.

652
00:35:37,911 --> 00:35:41,164
別他媽的再這樣做了  你這個瘋子
Well, don't fucking do that again, you maniac.

653
00:35:41,247 --> 00:35:43,166
真的
Seriously.

654
00:35:43,249 --> 00:35:46,002
你沒被抓真是奇跡
It's a miracle that you didn't get caught.

655
00:35:47,253 --> 00:35:49,423
我只是想見他
I just wanted to see him.

656
00:35:50,841 --> 00:35:55,303
但他好惡毒  真的好惡毒
But he is so mean. I mean, he's really mean.

657
00:35:56,388 --> 00:35:59,140
他不是我以為的那個人
He's not the man that I thought he was.

658
00:36:01,017 --> 00:36:02,436
你恨我嗎
Do you hate me?

659
00:36:02,519 --> 00:36:04,646
不  我不恨你
No, I don't hate you.

660
00:36:05,814 --> 00:36:07,690
但每一秒
Well, it is getting clearer

661
00:36:07,691 --> 00:36:11,027
都越來越清楚你是個瘋子
every second that you're totally bat-shit crazy,

662
00:36:11,111 --> 00:36:13,489
但你是個美麗可人的女生
but you're a beautiful, sweet girl.

663
00:36:14,948 --> 00:36:18,910
別去管這男人了  會有好多人愛你的
Fuck this guy. So many people are gonna love you.

664
00:36:18,994 --> 00:36:23,415
不  沒人會愛我
No. No, nobody's gonna love me.

665
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,167
我愛
I do.

666
00:36:32,173 --> 00:36:33,675
過來
Come here.

667
00:36:41,141 --> 00:36:43,101
萊瑞  是我
Hi, Larry. It's me.

668
00:36:43,184 --> 00:36:45,270
我知道我說過
Listen, I know that I said

669
00:36:45,353 --> 00:36:47,523
我不想知道是誰  我的確不想
I didn't wanna know who it was, and I didn't.

670
00:36:47,606 --> 00:36:51,943
但在這里  就是會讓人產生執念
But being in here, it just has a way of making you obsess

671
00:36:52,027 --> 00:36:55,238
感覺有點瘋狂
and feel a little crazy.

672
00:36:55,321 --> 00:36:56,490
嫉妒
Jealous.

673
00:36:56,573 --> 00:37:00,326
我知道這樣不公平  但這是我的感覺
So, I know this is totally unfair, but it's how I feel.

674
00:37:00,411 --> 00:37:02,663
所以我想如果我知道會好些
So I just think it would be better if I knew.

675
00:37:02,746 --> 00:37:06,124
如果我知道是誰  我就不用再猜了
If I just knew who it was, and then I could stop guessing.

676
00:37:06,207 --> 00:37:09,294
你的通話時間到了
Your phone time is up.

677
00:37:09,377 --> 00:37:11,379
我剛剛...
I... I'm just...

678
00:37:13,549 --> 00:37:15,634
再見
Um, bye.

679
00:37:15,717 --> 00:37:17,260
這樣就對了
That's right.

680
00:37:19,846 --> 00:37:20,847
走人吧
Move along.

681
00:37:20,931 --> 00:37:22,891
反正我也講完了
I was done anyway.

682
00:37:25,977 --> 00:37:28,480
我不是同性戀  我不是
I'm not gay. I'm not.

683
00:37:28,564 --> 00:37:29,898
我只是在嘗試
I'm just experimenting.

684
00:37:30,982 --> 00:37:31,983
我不知道
I don't know.

685
00:37:32,067 --> 00:37:34,820
也許一直以來我交往的男人
Maybe all of the guys that I've been with so far

686
00:37:34,903 --> 00:37:36,572
在床上表現都很差
have just been really bad in bed,

687
00:37:36,655 --> 00:37:38,990
但我告訴你
but I'm telling you,

688
00:37:39,074 --> 00:37:43,495
就好像我剛發現性愛應該是什么樣子
it's like I just discovered what sex is supposed to be.

689
00:37:43,579 --> 00:37:45,413
-但她有女友  -是啊
- But she has a girlfriend? - Mmm...

690
00:37:45,497 --> 00:37:46,832
她之前有女友
She had a girlfriend.

691
00:37:46,915 --> 00:37:49,334
她們之間有問題  已經結束了
They were having problems. It's over.

692
00:37:49,417 --> 00:37:51,336
-肯定嗎  -是的
- For sure? - Yeah.

693
00:37:51,419 --> 00:37:52,420
我不確定  帕波
I don't know, Piper.

694
00:37:56,758 --> 00:37:58,301
是誰
Who is that?

695
00:38:06,477 --> 00:38:10,230
我的天  我的天  袋里有屎
Oh, my God. Oh, my God! There's shit in that bag!

696
00:38:10,313 --> 00:38:12,190
你居然被騙了  這可是最古老的惡作劇了
You fell for that? That's like the oldest trick in the book.

697
00:38:12,273 --> 00:38:14,053
什么是最古老的惡作劇  
What is the oldest trick in the book? 

698
00:38:14,053 --> 00:38:16,903
屎在袋子里  點起火嗎
Poop? In a bag? On fire?

699
00:38:16,987 --> 00:38:18,697
我哥和他的朋友以前經常這樣做
Yes, my brother and his friends used to do it.

700
00:38:18,780 --> 00:38:20,741
真他媽的蠢  純粹惡作劇
It's so fucking stupid. It's a prank.

701
00:38:23,326 --> 00:38:24,578
老天
Oh, my God.

702
00:38:25,579 --> 00:38:26,913
-是她  -誰
- It's her. - Who?

703
00:38:26,997 --> 00:38:29,207
-西爾維  艾麗克斯的前女友  -真的嗎
- Sylvia. Alex's ex. - Really?

704
00:38:29,290 --> 00:38:31,251
她是個瘋婆子  她打了我
Yes, she's fucking crazy. She attacked me.

705
00:38:31,334 --> 00:38:33,795
這是她做的  我知道
This is... This is her, I know it.

706
00:38:33,879 --> 00:38:35,797
你覺得這是人屎嗎
Do you think it's human shit?

707
00:38:37,090 --> 00:38:40,051
不  這是狗屎  對嗎
No, I mean, this is... This is dog shit, right?

708
00:38:40,135 --> 00:38:42,053
如果她真的有你說的這樣瘋
I mean, if she's really as crazy as you say...

709
00:38:43,304 --> 00:38:46,474
你不會覺得這是她蹲下拉在袋子里的吧
You don't think that she squatted and pooped in a bag, do you?

710
00:38:47,893 --> 00:38:51,563
她的意思表達得很清楚了  佩服佩服
Well, she did get her point across. I'll give her that much.

711
00:38:51,647 --> 00:38:52,856
女同都是瘋子
Lesbians are insane.

712
00:38:54,482 --> 00:38:57,235
我不敢相信她對你說這種話  好大的膽子
I can't believe she said that to you. The fucking nerve! Jesus.

713
00:38:57,318 --> 00:38:58,529
她是對的
She was right.

714
00:38:58,612 --> 00:39:00,864
我引誘了他  我們故意陷害他
I seduced him. We set him up.

715
00:39:00,947 --> 00:39:03,074
但她不知道
Yeah, but she doesn't know that.

716
00:39:03,158 --> 00:39:05,536
這樣不對  他會坐牢  約翰
It's wrong. He's going to jail, John.

717
00:39:05,619 --> 00:39:07,245
有其它辦法嗎  怎樣  你想讓我...
What is the alternative? What, you want me to...

718
00:39:07,328 --> 00:39:08,519
你想讓我站出來大聲說
You want me to stand up and shout,

719
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:09,956
各位  她肚里是我的寶寶
"Hey, everyone, that's my baby in there"?

720
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:11,107
在我生活的地方
You know, in my neighborhood,

721
00:39:11,108 --> 00:39:12,543
真男人會站出來承認自己的孩子
real men stand up and claim their kids.

722
00:39:12,626 --> 00:39:14,628
我們不是在你生活的地方  不是嗎
We're not in your neighborhood, are we?

723
00:39:14,711 --> 00:39:16,254
你到底想要我怎樣  達婭
I mean, what the fuck do you want from me, Daya?

724
00:39:16,337 --> 00:39:18,549
我要你站出來告訴全世界你愛我
I want you to stand up and tell the world that you love me.

725
00:39:18,632 --> 00:39:19,716
這太瘋狂了
That is insane.

726
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:21,552
他們會把我推到媒體的峰尖浪口
They would cart me off in front of the local news.

727
00:39:21,635 --> 00:39:24,095
-你想要這樣嗎  -不  是的
- Is that what you want? - No. Yes.

728
00:39:24,179 --> 00:39:26,973
我不知道我想要什么  只是感覺很糟糕
I don't know what I want. It just feels really bad.

729
00:39:27,057 --> 00:39:29,309
達婭  我會坐牢的
Daya, I would go to jail.

730
00:39:30,727 --> 00:39:32,312
那樣至少我們扯平了
Well, then at least we'll be even.

731
00:39:58,755 --> 00:40:03,051
如果你是來嘲笑我的  我可沒力氣吵
If you're here to mock me, I don't have the energy to argue.

732
00:40:03,134 --> 00:40:04,803
做什么都痛
Everything hurts.

733
00:40:04,886 --> 00:40:06,847
我不是來取笑你的
I'm not here to make fun of you.

734
00:40:07,723 --> 00:40:08,890
是嗎
Really?

735
00:40:10,183 --> 00:40:13,394
我昨天看到一位朋友被拉去關禁閉
I watched a friend get taken to the SHU yesterday.

736
00:40:14,688 --> 00:40:17,023
那是她第二次被關禁閉
That's the second time she's been in there,

737
00:40:17,107 --> 00:40:19,400
第一次很痛苦
and the first time was rough.

738
00:40:19,484 --> 00:40:22,403
我已經厭惡厭倦了警衛把關禁閉
I'm sick and tired of the guards using solitary

739
00:40:22,487 --> 00:40:25,573
當作是罰小孩子站晲
like it's some kind of toddler timeout.

740
00:40:26,825 --> 00:40:29,577
這些人不是暴力罪犯
These are not violent offenders.

741
00:40:31,079 --> 00:40:35,000
這是不人道的  這是折磨
It's inhumane and it's torture.

742
00:40:36,542 --> 00:40:41,297
我覺得你這樣做  非常非常勇敢
I think what you're doing is very, very brave.

743
00:40:43,967 --> 00:40:46,845
你是個真正的維權分子
You are a true activist.

744
00:41:03,319 --> 00:41:05,155
你把我給你的傳單發完了嗎
Did you hand out all the flyers I gave you?

745
00:41:05,238 --> 00:41:07,532
當然了  發了  長官
'Course I did. Yes, sir.

746
00:41:09,242 --> 00:41:10,368
但我覺得沒人會...
But I really don't think anybody's gonna...

747
00:41:10,451 --> 00:41:12,704
我知道  德蓋特  我明白
I know, Doggett. I got it.

748
00:41:16,875 --> 00:41:19,044
-波麗  -你好
- Hey, Pol! - Hi.

749
00:41:19,127 --> 00:41:21,129
老天  你好苗條
Oh, my gosh, you're so skinny.

750
00:41:21,212 --> 00:41:23,715
你懷孕的肥屁股已經沒有了
Your big pregnancy ass is gone!

751
00:41:23,799 --> 00:41:25,466
我知道
I know.

752
00:41:26,718 --> 00:41:29,721
抱歉好久沒見了
I am so sorry it's been so long.

753
00:41:29,805 --> 00:41:32,223
帕波  塞萊斯特的事我很遺憾  
And, Pipe, I'm sorry about Celeste.

754
00:41:32,307 --> 00:41:35,185
我應該去參加葬禮的  我只是
I should have been at the funeral. I just...

755
00:41:35,268 --> 00:41:38,229
我的奶不多  擠奶太痛苦了
I'm not making that much milk, and pumping is really hard.

756
00:41:38,313 --> 00:41:40,691
萊瑞說你現在是個二十四孝老媽
Larry says you've been lost in the baby fog.

757
00:41:40,774 --> 00:41:41,775
我感覺好糟糕
I feel horrible.

758
00:41:41,858 --> 00:41:43,944
你失去了親人  我應該在你身邊的
You lost someone. I should have been there for you.

759
00:41:44,027 --> 00:41:45,403
真是對不起
I'm so, so sorry.

760
00:41:45,486 --> 00:41:47,864
-我真是太差勁了  -別說了  沒關系
- It was really shitty of me. - Stop, it's fine.

761
00:41:47,948 --> 00:41:49,074
不  有關系
It's not. It's not fine.

762
00:41:49,157 --> 00:41:51,785
你需要我我卻不在  我是個差勁的朋友
You needed me and I wasn't there. I've been a really bad friend.

763
00:41:51,868 --> 00:41:53,995
最差勁的朋友  你不應該有我這樣的朋友
Like, the worst. You don't deserve that.

764
00:41:54,996 --> 00:41:56,581
你不應該經歷這些
You don't deserve any of this.

765
00:41:59,334 --> 00:42:01,377
-當媽的感覺如何  -好難
- How is mommy life? - Hard.

766
00:42:01,461 --> 00:42:03,254
比任何人講的都難多了
It's so much harder than anyone tells you.

767
00:42:03,338 --> 00:42:05,924
我覺得我失去理智了  我不再是自己了
I feel like I've lost my mind. I'm not myself.

768
00:42:06,007 --> 00:42:07,675
-皮特還好嗎  -皮特去了阿拉斯加
- Is Pete being good? - Pete took off to Alaska.

769
00:42:07,759 --> 00:42:09,677
好奇怪  他太煩人了
It was weird and totally horrible of him.

770
00:42:09,761 --> 00:42:11,888
你經常見萊瑞嗎
Have you seen Larry a lot?

771
00:42:11,972 --> 00:42:14,557
沒有  為什么問  他說的嗎
No. Why, did he tell you that?

772
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:16,517
只是皮特離開期間
I mean, just when Pete was gone. 

773
00:42:16,518 --> 00:42:18,394
芬恩的事他幫了我不少
He helped me a lot with Finn.

774
00:42:19,562 --> 00:42:21,314
你們還經常通話嗎
Are you guys still talking a lot?

775
00:42:21,397 --> 00:42:23,817
我們剛在一起整整48小時
Well, we just spent the past 48 hours together.

776
00:42:24,818 --> 00:42:25,819
怎么樣
How did that go?

777
00:42:26,862 --> 00:42:27,863
我們做愛了
We had sex.

778
00:42:27,946 --> 00:42:31,867
我們開始了  在給我奶奶守靈時
Well, we started to. At my grandmother's wake.

779
00:42:31,950 --> 00:42:33,118
是嗎
Really?

780
00:42:33,201 --> 00:42:34,745
你很驚訝嗎
Does that surprise you?

781
00:42:35,536 --> 00:42:38,706
是啊  我以為你和他結束了
Uh, well, yeah, I thought you ended things.

782
00:42:38,790 --> 00:42:41,251
他曾經是我的未婚夫  波麗  還是有愛的
He was my fiance Polly. There's still a lot of love there.

783
00:42:41,334 --> 00:42:42,377
當然
Of course.

784
00:42:44,337 --> 00:42:45,713
他和別人上過床了
He slept with someone else.

785
00:42:46,882 --> 00:42:47,966
是嗎
Really?

786
00:42:48,049 --> 00:42:49,425
他告訴你了嗎
Did he tell you that?

787
00:42:49,509 --> 00:42:51,094
沒有  他為什么會告訴我
No, why would he tell me that?

788
00:42:52,137 --> 00:42:54,848
你們一直有聯系
You two... have been talking.

789
00:42:54,931 --> 00:42:56,933
你們關系好  他幫你照顧芬恩
You're close. He's been helping you with Finn.

790
00:42:57,017 --> 00:42:58,601
我們關系也沒那么好
Oh, we're not that close.

791
00:43:01,354 --> 00:43:04,399
他跟你怎么說的
Um... what did he tell you?

792
00:43:07,778 --> 00:43:09,905
是我認識的人
That it was someone I know.

793
00:43:13,449 --> 00:43:16,369
我想他感覺相當內疚
I think he was feeling pretty guilty.

794
00:43:17,703 --> 00:43:20,748
他可能覺得那是一個錯誤
He probably felt like it was a mistake.

795
00:43:22,918 --> 00:43:24,252
他不想傷害你
He doesn't want to hurt you.

796
00:43:25,628 --> 00:43:27,422
我相信他不想
I'm sure that he doesn't.

797
00:43:28,756 --> 00:43:30,675
你覺得她會謀殺我嗎
Do you think she's gonna murder me?

798
00:43:30,758 --> 00:43:33,344
這個西爾維到底有多不正常
Just how unstable is this Sylvia person?

799
00:43:33,428 --> 00:43:35,638
-那是個玩笑  -那不是玩笑
- It was a joke. - It was not a joke!

800
00:43:35,721 --> 00:43:37,390
那是個意思很清楚的口信
It was a very clear message.

801
00:43:37,473 --> 00:43:39,397
我知道你做了什么  婊子  
"I know what you did, bitch, 

802
00:43:39,397 --> 00:43:41,436
我要你知道我知道了
and I want you to know that I know."

803
00:43:42,854 --> 00:43:47,650
和你在一起是我的選擇
Look, being with you was my choice.

804
00:43:47,733 --> 00:43:49,277
我之前不開心
I wasn't happy.

805
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:51,112
然后我利用了這點
And then I took advantage of that.

806
00:43:51,196 --> 00:43:53,364
我是個成年人  帕波
I'm a grown-up, Piper.

807
00:43:53,448 --> 00:43:55,491
你覺得她會來找我麻煩嗎
Do you think that she's gonna come after me?

808
00:43:57,243 --> 00:43:58,403
我覺得她需要的是
Look, I think that she needed to 

809
00:43:58,404 --> 00:44:00,831
發泄出來  明白嗎
get it out of her system, all right?

810
00:44:00,914 --> 00:44:04,625
有時候需要大怒一下才能放下
Sometimes you gotta rage in order to move on.

811
00:44:06,294 --> 00:44:08,379
你愛過她嗎
Did you love her?

812
00:44:10,465 --> 00:44:11,799
沒有
No.

813
00:44:13,593 --> 00:44:14,886
但我愛你
But I love you.

814
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:18,681
真的嗎
You do?

815
00:44:32,278 --> 00:44:34,155
這話我可不是隨便對每個人說的
I don't say that to everyone.

816
00:44:38,493 --> 00:44:40,036
你得回應我
You have to say it back.

817
00:44:43,206 --> 00:44:45,000
我也愛你
I love you, too.

818
00:45:09,857 --> 00:45:11,192
你想談談嗎
Do you wanna talk about it?

819
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:13,403
不
No.

820
00:45:22,203 --> 00:45:25,290
還記得我告訴你  我未婚夫干了別的女人嗎
Remember I told you that my fiance fucked somebody else?

821
00:45:25,373 --> 00:45:26,541
是的
Yeah.

822
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:31,922
是我最好的朋友
It was my best friend.

823
00:45:36,217 --> 00:45:37,635
請讓我一個人待下好嗎
Can I be alone for a minute, please?

824
00:45:37,718 --> 00:45:39,220
當然  親愛的
Sure, honey.

825
00:45:50,898 --> 00:45:54,777
親愛的  自己喝下毒藥是不可能殺死敵人的
Honey, you don't drink poison and wait for it to kill your enemy.

826
00:45:56,029 --> 00:45:59,907
別再捶暀F  計劃復仇吧
Stop hitting walls and plot your revenge.

827
00:47:40,341 --> 00:47:42,802
媽的
Oh, fuck!

828
00:48:16,586 --> 00:48:19,214
你他媽的在做什么
What the fuck do you think you're doing?

829
00:48:20,673 --> 00:48:24,719
我想加入你的園藝俱樂部
You know, I think I'd like to join your little gardening club.

830
00:48:25,720 --> 00:48:27,805
我們不接受新會員
We're not accepting new members.

831
00:48:29,056 --> 00:48:32,977
挖隧道嗎  紅媽  你以為你是兔八哥啊
A tunnel, Red? That is so Bugs Bunny.

832
00:48:33,060 --> 00:48:35,855
你打算怎么做  出賣我嗎
What are you gonna do, turn me in?

833
00:48:35,938 --> 00:48:37,565
不  我會用上這個
No, I'm gonna use it.

834
00:48:38,691 --> 00:48:40,318
你有你自己的門路
You have your own operation.

835
00:48:40,401 --> 00:48:42,445
我知道  但這個更好
Yeah, I know, but this is better.

836
00:48:42,528 --> 00:48:46,116
更少的人參與  沒有不穩定的供貨聯系
Fewer people involved and no unstable vendor connections.

837
00:48:46,199 --> 00:48:48,326
-不可能歸你  -不是的
- You're not taking it. - No, no, no, no, no.

838
00:48:48,409 --> 00:48:49,844
我可不想奪走你的姑娘們的
I wouldn't want to deprive your girls 

839
00:48:49,845 --> 00:48:52,330
屎味的連褲襪
of their shit-flavored panty hose.

840
00:48:53,414 --> 00:48:54,415
我們可以分享
We could share.

841
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,253
你不懂如何分享
You don't know how to share.

842
00:48:58,336 --> 00:49:01,172
只會搶奪  只會欺凌弱小
Just to take and to bully.

843
00:49:02,590 --> 00:49:03,924
我們曾經做過朋友 
We used to be friends once.

844
00:49:05,926 --> 00:49:08,596
我想再和你做朋友
I want to be friends again, man!

845
00:49:09,805 --> 00:49:11,056
好個朋友
Some friend.

846
00:49:13,100 --> 00:49:14,977
你會考慮下嗎
Will you think about it, huh?

847
00:49:17,104 --> 00:49:20,941
你也想想這些年你變了多少好嗎
And would you think about how much you've changed over the years?

848
00:49:22,360 --> 00:49:24,529
人會變  紅媽
People change, Red.

849
00:50:42,189 --> 00:50:43,524
妮琪
Nicky.

850
00:50:45,443 --> 00:50:47,820
你覺得人會變嗎
Do you think people can change?

851
00:50:51,115 --> 00:50:52,575
好了
All right.

852
00:50:55,411 --> 00:50:58,498
你把這個幫我拿走  因為我會吸
I need you to take this from me, 'cause I'm gonna do it.

853
00:50:59,624 --> 00:51:01,334
但我真的真的不想
And I really, really don't want to.

854
00:51:05,045 --> 00:51:06,297
誰給你的
Who gave that to you?

855
00:51:06,381 --> 00:51:09,049
美味姐  維的貨
Taystee. It came from Vee.

856
00:51:10,801 --> 00:51:13,388
真是對不起  紅媽  我讓你失望了
I'm so sorry, Red. I let you down.

857
00:51:15,055 --> 00:51:17,016
-你沒有  -是嘛
- No, you didn't. - Yeah.

858
00:51:18,268 --> 00:51:19,810
你拿來了
You brought it here.

859
00:51:20,895 --> 00:51:22,104
你做得非常好  妮琪
You did good, Nicky.

860
00:51:23,731 --> 00:51:25,024
你做到了
You did.

861
00:51:42,750 --> 00:51:45,127
姑娘  穩著點
Hey, girl, steady there.

862
00:51:46,253 --> 00:51:48,298
我很好  我沒事
I'm fine. I'm good.

863
00:51:51,467 --> 00:51:53,886
-維  -啥事
- Yo, Vee! - Yeah.

864
00:51:53,969 --> 00:51:57,264
-操你媽  -媽的  妹子  你喝醉了
- Fuck you. - Oh, shit, girl, you blind drunk.

865
00:51:57,348 --> 00:52:00,017
你要搶走我的工作
You want to take my fucking job assignment?

866
00:52:00,100 --> 00:52:02,812
你要搶走我所有的朋友  操你媽
You want to take all my friends? Well, fuck you!

867
00:52:02,895 --> 00:52:05,356
在她傷到自己之前  來個人把她弄走吧
Somebody get her out of here before she hurts herself.

868
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:07,317
操你媽
Fuck you!

869
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:08,401
媽的
Shit!

870
00:52:08,484 --> 00:52:09,652
操你媽
Fuck you!

871
00:52:11,070 --> 00:52:13,364
-媽的  -你別碰她
- Fuck! - Don't you touch her!

872
00:52:13,448 --> 00:52:14,865
不不
No! No! No!

873
00:52:25,292 --> 00:52:29,296
你不聽話就會是這個下場
That's what you get when you don't listen!

874
00:52:29,380 --> 00:52:31,632
就會是這個下場
That's what you get!

875
00:52:52,403 --> 00:52:53,446
不
No.

876
00:53:23,684 --> 00:53:24,685
喂
Hello?

877
00:53:24,769 --> 00:53:28,147
利奇菲爾德聯邦監獄的女犯打來電話
An inmate from Litchfield Federal Prison is attempting to contact you.

878
00:53:28,230 --> 00:53:30,858
要接聽電話  請按一
To accept this call, please press "One."

879
00:53:33,861 --> 00:53:36,656
-卡爾的電話  -內莉  卡爾在嗎
- Cal's phone. - Neri, hey, is Cal there?

880
00:53:36,739 --> 00:53:38,126
他去樹林覓食去了
No, he's out foraging in

881
00:53:38,127 --> 00:53:40,785
去找吃起來有蔬菜味的蔬菜
the forest for greens that taste really green.

882
00:53:40,868 --> 00:53:42,537
但他可能已經快好了  要我叫他嗎
But he's probably almost done. Should I go get him?

883
00:53:43,538 --> 00:53:44,997
也許你能幫我
Actually, maybe you can help me.

884
00:53:45,080 --> 00:53:48,208
好啊  小姑子
Yeah, sister-in-law!

885
00:53:48,292 --> 00:53:49,752
什么忙都行
Whatever you need, dude.

886
00:53:49,835 --> 00:53:52,212
我需要你幫我一次
I need you to do me a favor.

887
00:53:53,631 --> 00:53:55,090
一個大忙
It's a big one.

888
00:54:16,529 --> 00:54:18,405
我活該
I deserve that.

889
00:54:23,744 --> 00:54:24,912
-好啦  -嘿
- All right. - Hey.

890
00:54:26,789 --> 00:54:27,957
我為你驕傲
I'm proud of you.

891
00:54:28,040 --> 00:54:30,250
那就快滾
Then get the fuck out of here.

892
00:54:34,213 --> 00:54:36,966
-什么事  -沒什么
- What was that about? - Nothing.

893
00:54:40,511 --> 00:54:43,764
你有沒有見過一種畫面  會烙在你的腦海里的
You ever seen an image that sears itself into your brain?

894
00:54:43,848 --> 00:54:45,683
就像那部講驢友的電影
Like the movie about the hiker guy,

895
00:54:45,766 --> 00:54:50,437
他用瑞士軍刀把自己的胳膊給切斷了
where he cuts off his own arm with a Swiss Army knife?

896
00:54:50,521 --> 00:54:53,483
那個聲音  肌腱
Yeah, the sound, the tendons...

897
00:54:53,566 --> 00:54:54,609
媽的
Fuck!

898
00:54:55,610 --> 00:54:57,277
我真希望自己沒看過那部分
I wish I never watched that part.

899
00:54:58,488 --> 00:54:59,780
你知道什么讓我覺得更惡心嗎
You know what tops that for me?

900
00:54:59,864 --> 00:55:03,576
什么畫面讓我忘不掉  在腦海里揮之不去
You know what image I can't unsee, it's still stuck in there,

901
00:55:03,659 --> 00:55:07,412
一天至少想到一次  讓我沒胃口吃午飯
flickering at least once a day, making me want to lose my lunch?

902
00:55:08,706 --> 00:55:10,165
不知道  先生
No, sir.

903
00:55:10,249 --> 00:55:13,418
你的光屁股  門德斯
Your bare ass, Mendez.

904
00:55:13,503 --> 00:55:16,213
你那長疙瘩的蒼白屁股
Your pimply, white ass,

905
00:55:16,296 --> 00:55:20,092
在掃把拖把間上上下下
bouncing up and down between the brooms and the mops,

906
00:55:20,175 --> 00:55:22,469
撞擊那可憐的姑娘
ramming into that poor girl.

907
00:55:22,553 --> 00:55:26,098
一個你本應保護保障她安全的姑娘
A girl you were supposed to protect and keep safe.

908
00:55:27,266 --> 00:55:29,644
你的屁股  像鬼一樣纏著我
Your ass, it haunts me.

909
00:55:31,020 --> 00:55:32,980
抱歉聽到這個  先生
I'm sorry to hear that, sir.

910
00:55:34,064 --> 00:55:36,191
我做這行已經25年了
I've been doing this kind of work 25 years.

911
00:55:36,275 --> 00:55:41,238
就是像你這樣的人  給了這份職業一個壞名聲
And it's guys like you that give the whole profession a bad name.

912
00:55:42,447 --> 00:55:43,448
如果我說了算
If it was up to me,

913
00:55:43,533 --> 00:55:45,409
你永遠別再想涉足這個地方
you'd never set foot on this property again.

914
00:55:45,492 --> 00:55:47,912
但考慮到懲教署不提出起訴
But considering the DOC didn't press charges,

915
00:55:47,995 --> 00:55:50,414
之前只是我們間的言語之爭
it was your word against mine...

916
00:55:52,625 --> 00:55:54,043
直到現在
until now.

917
00:55:56,295 --> 00:55:58,881
我一直在本分工作  先生
Well, I've been doing my job, sir.

918
00:55:58,964 --> 00:56:01,008
今天早上就記了15個過了
Just gave out 15 shots this morning.

919
00:56:02,552 --> 00:56:03,719
你讓她懷孕了
You got her pregnant.

920
00:56:09,809 --> 00:56:10,810
不
No.

921
00:56:12,603 --> 00:56:14,021
對她來說很不幸  是的
Sadly for her, yes.

922
00:56:14,855 --> 00:56:16,774
那個可憐的姑娘懷上了
That poor girl is carrying around

923
00:56:16,857 --> 00:56:21,111
一個大胡子虐待狂的孽種
a sadistic little mustachioed shit inside her.

924
00:56:21,654 --> 00:56:24,156
-哇  -門德斯
- Whoa. - Mendez...

925
00:56:24,239 --> 00:56:26,533
你他媽的被炒了
you're fucking fired.

926
00:56:30,037 --> 00:56:31,080
我明白  先生
I understand, sir.

927
00:56:35,375 --> 00:56:39,046
不  我想你沒明白
No, I... I don't think you do understand.

928
00:56:40,547 --> 00:56:42,424
你還被逮捕了
You're also under arrest.

929
00:56:44,719 --> 00:56:45,720
我們到了
We're in.

930
00:56:45,803 --> 00:56:47,722
我來吧
Let me get that for ya.

931
00:56:50,933 --> 00:56:52,392
好了  咱們走
All right, let's go.

932
00:56:55,229 --> 00:56:57,481
我們在利奇菲爾德聯邦監獄現場報導
We're reporting from Litchfield Federal Penitentiary,

933
00:56:57,564 --> 00:57:00,484
獄警喬治·門德斯被逮捕
where the arrest of Correctional Officer George Mendez

934
00:57:00,567 --> 00:57:02,987
他被起訴性侵犯  逮捕正在進行中
on charges of sexual assault is underway.

935
00:57:03,070 --> 00:57:04,488
她來了
There she is!

936
00:57:04,571 --> 00:57:05,990
我旁邊是娜塔莉·菲格羅亞
I'm here with Natalie Figueroa,

937
00:57:06,073 --> 00:57:07,908
利奇菲爾德聯邦監獄的助理典獄長
Assistant Warden of Litchfield prison,

938
00:57:07,992 --> 00:57:09,412
她是杰森·菲格羅亞的妻子
and wife of Jason Figueroa,

939
00:57:09,413 --> 00:57:11,621
后者現正競選州參議員
who is currently running for state senate.

940
00:57:11,704 --> 00:57:12,808
菲格羅亞夫人  
Miss Figueroa, 

941
00:57:12,808 --> 00:57:15,791
你知道警員中有不當行為存在嗎
were you aware of misconduct among your officers?

942
00:57:15,875 --> 00:57:17,084
在利奇菲爾德
Here at Litchfield,

943
00:57:17,167 --> 00:57:19,138
我們對性罪犯者
we have a zero-tolerance

944
00:57:19,139 --> 00:57:22,506
是絕對不會容忍的
policy when it comes to sexual offenders.

945
00:57:24,174 --> 00:57:26,844
自《消除監獄強奸法案》頒布以來
Since the Prison Rape Elimination Act,

946
00:57:26,927 --> 00:57:32,099
消除惡劣警員便成了我們的任務
we have made it our mandate to weed out rogue officers.

947
00:57:34,685 --> 00:57:38,773
這些無助的女性在我們的照顧下
These vulnerable women are under our care,

948
00:57:38,856 --> 00:57:42,652
我們會盡一切能力去保護她們
and we do everything in our power to protect them.

949
00:57:44,695 --> 00:57:47,698
當然  這個世界上依然有壞人
Of course, there are still bad people in this world

950
00:57:47,782 --> 00:57:49,909
會犯下十惡不赦的罪行
who commit heinous crimes,

951
00:57:49,992 --> 00:57:51,788
不幸的是
and it is unfortunate that

952
00:57:51,789 --> 00:57:54,830
其中一個道德敗壞的人  居然在我們這里
one of these sickos ended up under our roof.

953
00:57:54,914 --> 00:57:59,376
但我向你保證  我們會盡一切力量
But I assure you, we are doing everything in our power

954
00:57:59,459 --> 00:58:02,488
照顧這位年輕女性  
to take care of this young woman,

955
00:58:02,489 --> 00:58:05,215
她才是真正的受害者

956
00:58:05,299 --> 00:58:07,760
-等我  親愛的  -快走
- Wait for me, baby. - All right, keep it moving.

957
00:58:07,843 --> 00:58:10,345
知道嗎  我不在乎了
You know what? I don't care anymore.

958
00:58:11,471 --> 00:58:13,348
來吧  逮捕我

959

你聽到我的話嗎
You hear me?

961
00:58:17,644 --> 00:58:20,230
她懷的是我的寶寶  老子愛死你了

962
00:58:21,398 --> 00:58:23,734
我要給孩子取名叫斯坦  好嗎
I want to call it Stan, okay?

963

別舉重東西
Don't lift anything heavy!

964
00:58:25,820 --> 00:58:28,280
別吃吞拿魚  也別吃軟芝士
And no tuna fish! Or soft cheese.

965
00:58:28,363 --> 00:58:29,650
我會回來找你的  親愛的

我會照顧你的  照顧你們母子

967
00:58:31,450 --> 00:58:33,493

Let's go. You're done here.
