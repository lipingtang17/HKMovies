1
00:01:13,734 --> 00:01:18,517
女子監獄 第二季 第七集


2
00:01:21,112 --> 00:01:23,198
這里面不用放濾嘴嗎
Yo, shouldn't we be putting filters in these?

3
00:01:23,281 --> 00:01:25,158
濾嘴  我們在哪兒  鄉村俱樂部嗎
Filters? Where we at, the country club?

4
00:01:25,921 --> 00:01:26,864
我們怎么不派發
Ooh, why don't we give 'em out

5
00:01:26,864 --> 00:01:29,245
煙斗和皮草  就像庫伊拉那樣
with cigarette holders and fur coats like Cruella?

6
00:01:27,535 --> 00:01:29,245
{\an8}電影《101只斑點狗》中的壞女人


7
00:01:29,329 --> 00:01:31,706
還有霍莉·戈萊特麗  她戴小皇冠
And Holly Golightly. She had a tiara.

8
00:01:29,329 --> 00:01:31,706
{\an8}電影《蒂凡尼的早餐》中的曼哈頓交際花


9
00:01:31,790 --> 00:01:35,168
如果要放濾嘴  就得把香煙卷大些
Put filters in, you got to roll the cigarettes bigger to match.

10
00:01:35,251 --> 00:01:37,003
那樣會減少利潤
Eats into our margins.

11
00:01:37,087 --> 00:01:39,840
你說每支煙換一本食品券
You talkin' 'bout chargin' a book of stamps per,

12
00:01:39,923 --> 00:01:41,549
你到手的利潤已經挺豐厚了
you got pretty good margins already.

13
00:01:41,632 --> 00:01:44,010
-一支煙幾乎九美元  -胡說八道
- That's like nine bucks a smoke. - Oh, shit.

14
00:01:44,094 --> 00:01:44,449
看來沃森
Looks like Watson

15
00:01:44,449 --> 00:01:48,598
知道什么叫供求關系了
is gettin' introduced to our good friends supply and demand.

16
00:01:48,682 --> 00:01:49,766
停手  警衛來了
Cheese it. Fuzz.

17
00:01:51,184 --> 00:01:53,311
水槽里有塊生肉  你能清理下嗎
Would you clean a sink with a piece of raw meat?

18
00:01:53,394 --> 00:01:55,271
你怕有細菌就不肯清理
No, you wouldn't, because of germs.

19
00:01:55,355 --> 00:01:59,109
骯臟的海綿就像塊臭肉
A filthy sponge is like a rectangle of smelly meat.

20
00:01:59,192 --> 00:02:00,026
研究表明
Studies show

21
00:02:00,027 --> 00:02:02,738
浴室水槽里的細菌比廁所還多
that bathroom sinks have more germs in it than a toilet.

22
00:02:02,821 --> 00:02:04,572
-你得消毒  -消毒
- You gotta disinfect! - Disinfect.

23
00:02:04,655 --> 00:02:06,282
你知道哪里的細菌比廁所還多嗎
You know what else has more germs than a toilet?

24
00:02:06,366 --> 00:02:07,450
你的嘴巴
Your mouth.

25
00:02:07,533 --> 00:02:10,328
還有自動取款機的鍵盤和女人的包底
And also ATM keypads and the bottom of ladies' handbags.

26
00:02:10,411 --> 00:02:11,579
我讀到的
I read that.

27
00:02:11,662 --> 00:02:14,791
我們在監獄里每天都能學到新東西呀
You know, we learn something new every day here in prison.

28
00:02:25,844 --> 00:02:29,055
好吧  聽好了  姑娘們
All right. Listen up, ladies.

10029
00:02:29,139 --> 00:02:31,516
如果讓顧客選普通郵票和永久郵票
Now, if a customer's got regular stamps and forever stamps,

10030
00:02:29,139 --> 00:02:31,516
{\an8}無論郵費怎么漲  該郵票永遠可以用


10031
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:33,476
她都會選永久郵票
she always take the forever stamps.

10032
00:02:33,559 --> 00:02:34,375
所以你就要囤貨
You hold on to those,

10033
00:02:34,375 --> 00:02:36,229
等郵局漲價的時候
and when the post office jacks up the prices,

10034
00:02:36,312 --> 00:02:37,313
你就賺到了
you've made money.

35
00:02:37,397 --> 00:02:41,777
你是說是你賺的錢  你可是要拿九成
You mean you made money. You taking like 90%, ain't you?

10036
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:45,280
一把郵票弄出去  你的手下就能拿去變錢了
Sendin' those stamps outside, your boys turn 'em into bank.

37
00:02:45,363 --> 00:02:47,115
我可是承擔風險的那個人
I'm the one assuming the risk.

38
00:02:47,198 --> 00:02:49,614
那我還冒著被關禁閉
Uh, what about my risk of sitting in seg

39
00:02:49,615 --> 00:02:51,494
關到瘋掉的危險呢
till I start talkin' to my hand?

40
00:02:51,577 --> 00:02:53,371
你想要零風險  那就走
You want 0%, walk away.

41
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:56,707
姑娘們  這不僅僅是一樁生意
This is about more than just a business, ladies.

42
00:02:56,792 --> 00:03:00,545
這是為你們自己爭取權益
This is about making something of yourselves.

43
00:03:00,628 --> 00:03:02,577
你給了她們想要的
You give those women something they want,

44
00:03:02,578 --> 00:03:05,258
她們就會因此尊重你
they will respect you for it.

45
00:03:05,341 --> 00:03:07,677
我干完了
Yeah. I'm done.

46
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,846
很好  交給美味
That's very good. Give 'em to Taystee.

47
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:11,097
可它們都是我做的
But they're mine.

48
00:03:11,181 --> 00:03:13,892
我們談過  蘇珊娜  還記得嗎
We had this talk, Suzanne. Remember?

49
00:03:13,975 --> 00:03:15,560
我們每個人都有技能
We each have skills.

50
00:03:15,643 --> 00:03:17,979
但你沒有推銷的技能
Salesmanship, not one of yours.

51
00:03:19,730 --> 00:03:22,275
得讓別人樂意才會買
Gotta make people feel more comfortable.

52
00:03:23,359 --> 00:03:25,528
維  我們要把這些貨放哪里
Yo, Vee, where we supposed to keep all of these?

53
00:03:25,611 --> 00:03:28,406
我可不想關禁閉
'Cause a sister is not tryin' to go to SHU.

54
00:03:28,489 --> 00:03:31,659
你有什么隱身斗篷之類的嗎
You got some kind of invisibility cloak or somethin'?

55
00:03:31,742 --> 00:03:33,453
你說對了
You could say that.

56
00:03:39,375 --> 00:03:41,878
是我要求太高了嗎
Am I asking too much here?

57
00:03:41,962 --> 00:03:46,967
我有強加給你們什么辦不到的事嗎
Am I putting something on you people that you physically can't do,

58
00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:50,428
像是跳探戈之類的
like dance the tango or something?

59
00:03:50,511 --> 00:03:54,140
沒有  我是要你們稱職點
No. I'm asking for competence.

60
00:03:54,224 --> 00:03:58,269
首先  讓囚犯待在監獄里
For starters, keeping the prisoners in prison.

61
00:03:58,353 --> 00:04:00,188
在我看來相當簡單
Seems pretty simple to me.

62
00:04:00,271 --> 00:04:02,208
別穿著沾了水果蛋糕的卡其褲
Not having a fruitcake in khakis

63
00:04:02,209 --> 00:04:03,900
在大家面前走來走去
wander around in public,

64
00:04:03,984 --> 00:04:05,735
要五個警衛押她出去
five officers hustling her out,

65
00:04:05,819 --> 00:04:08,071
塞進車里  該死的就像小丑表演
putting her in a car like some kind of fucking clown show.

66
00:04:08,154 --> 00:04:09,364
我在說你呢  本尼特
I'm talkin' to you, Bennett.

67
00:04:09,447 --> 00:04:11,407
-是你把我一人丟在這兒的  -胡說
- You left me here alone. - That is false.

68
00:04:11,491 --> 00:04:12,492
我當時也在這里
Yeah, I was here.

69
00:04:12,575 --> 00:04:15,661
對  你拿著《鱸魚大師》雜志到處晃
Yeah, you were patrolling a copy of Bassmaster Magazine.

70
00:04:15,745 --> 00:04:17,788
我只是要很恭敬地說一句
I'm just saying, respectfully,

71
00:04:17,873 --> 00:04:19,958
也許情人節并不是
that maybe Valentine's wasn't the best day

72
00:04:20,041 --> 00:04:21,751
帶著一堆人去酒吧看你表演的最佳時機
to take a bunch of people to see your gig at a bar.

73
00:04:21,835 --> 00:04:23,586
又不是之前沒人出去過
It's not like people haven't gotten out before.

74
00:04:23,669 --> 00:04:25,588
送她去重刑監獄  刑期再多加幾年
Take her to Max, stick a few years on her sentence.

75
00:04:25,671 --> 00:04:26,644
這女人都坐了一輩子牢了
The woman's 100 years old.

76
00:04:26,645 --> 00:04:28,216
還要給她加刑
We're gonna give her more time?

77
00:04:28,299 --> 00:04:31,928
貝爾  我要你對那個囚犯實施全方位盯人
Bell, I want you all over that inmate like a fly on shit.

78
00:04:32,012 --> 00:04:34,890
你跟著她  找出她逃走的路線
You follow her. You find out how she's running.

79
00:04:34,973 --> 00:04:36,599
我們就好好問問她怎么樣
How about we just ask her?

80
00:04:36,682 --> 00:04:37,893
我已經問過了
I already did.

81
00:04:37,976 --> 00:04:40,686
她告訴我她是從27街拿到手推車的
She told me she took the trolley from 27th Street.

82
00:04:41,729 --> 00:04:43,239
等我們把這個漏洞堵上
I will deal with this officially

83
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,900
我會正式處理這件事
when we get the hole plugged up.

84
00:04:44,983 --> 00:04:49,445
你要我整天盯著菲利斯·狄勒
You want me 'round the clock babysittin' Phyllis Diller?

85
00:04:49,529 --> 00:04:53,658
如果你覺得浪費了你的才能和學識就告訴我
Let me know if that is a waste of your talents and education.

86
00:04:53,741 --> 00:04:55,911
第二  記過配額指標
Second, shot quota.

87
00:04:55,994 --> 00:04:57,828
我們得把這里好好整頓一番
We are gonna straighten things up around here.

88
00:04:57,913 --> 00:05:01,374
我要你們每人每周至少記過五筆
I want each of you writing five shots a week minimum.

89
00:05:01,457 --> 00:05:03,334
讓這些姑娘們老實點
Keep these ladies on point.

90
00:05:04,544 --> 00:05:06,546
-你要記過六筆  -這不公平
- And for you, it's six. - That's not fair.

91
00:05:06,629 --> 00:05:10,550
我要你對她們狠點  我會盯著你完成的
I asked you to toughen up your game. I'll see you gettin' there.

92
00:05:10,633 --> 00:05:11,427
這要煩死人了  卡普托
Gonna be such a bitch, Caputo.

93
00:05:11,428 --> 00:05:12,718
光是文書工作就很煩
The paperwork alone.

94
00:05:12,802 --> 00:05:16,722
去跟你媽說  也許她會給你寫個便條
Tell it to your mom. Maybe she'll write you a fuckin' note.

95
00:05:16,806 --> 00:05:18,183
滾出去
Get out.

96
00:05:24,855 --> 00:05:26,441
犯人  你點名遲到了
Inmate. You're late for count.

97
00:05:27,483 --> 00:05:29,569
-還有45秒  -你來不及走到那里
- I got 45 seconds still. - Not enough time to get there.

98
00:05:29,652 --> 00:05:31,237
這算什么  《少數派報告》
What is this, The Minority Report?

99
00:05:31,321 --> 00:05:33,156
抱歉  我要給你記上一筆
Sorry. I'm gonna write you a shot.

100
00:05:33,239 --> 00:05:36,576
什么你  白人妞辛迪也遲到了啊
What you... White Cindy ain't gonna make it, either.

101
00:05:36,659 --> 00:05:37,785
我看的不是白人妞辛迪
I ain't looking at White Cindy.

102
00:05:37,868 --> 00:05:39,870
這絕對是種族歧視了吧
This is some racism right here!

103
00:05:39,955 --> 00:05:42,498
不是  不過如果你不閉嘴就會算了
It's not. But it's about to be if you don't shut up.

104
00:05:42,582 --> 00:05:44,834
這他媽的算什么意思
What the hell that even mean?

105
00:05:44,917 --> 00:05:45,918
趴在地上  犯人
Get down on the ground, inmate.

106
00:05:46,002 --> 00:05:47,212
你他媽在跟我開玩笑
Fucking kidding me?

107
00:05:47,295 --> 00:05:49,005
我剛才說什么了
What'd I just say?

108
00:05:51,257 --> 00:05:53,343
好吧  動作快點  公民們
All right, let's move it, people.

109
00:05:53,426 --> 00:05:54,885
把你的鞋子脫了
And take your shoes off.

110
00:05:54,970 --> 00:05:56,512
我都不知道我為什么還要廢話
I don't even know why I even got to say it.

111
00:05:56,596 --> 00:06:01,767
抱歉  我請你把汽水扔掉
Oh! Excuse me. I'm gonna need you to throw out that soda.

112
00:06:01,851 --> 00:06:02,893
我還在喝呢
I'm still drinking it.

113
00:06:02,978 --> 00:06:04,770
你還在喝
You still drinkin' it?

114
00:06:05,771 --> 00:06:07,440
恐怖分子也是這么說的
That's what the terrorists say.

115
00:06:08,649 --> 00:06:11,027
你是恐怖分子嗎
You a terrorist?

116
00:06:11,111 --> 00:06:13,196
扔掉
Throw it out!

117
00:06:13,279 --> 00:06:16,782
拜托  快點  走  你  快點
Come on, people. Let's move it. Let's go. You, come on.

118
00:06:16,866 --> 00:06:19,369
-好了  -小心點  女士
- Oh, yeah! - Watch it, lady.

119
00:06:19,452 --> 00:06:20,536
讓路
Move out the way!

120
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:22,872
機場緊急救援
Airport emergency.

121
00:06:26,209 --> 00:06:27,460
到手
Got it!

122
00:06:45,811 --> 00:06:48,148
棒呆
Oh, yeah!

123
00:06:51,151 --> 00:06:54,404
中頭獎了  寶貝
Ooh. Jackpot, baby. Ah. Mmm.

124
00:06:54,487 --> 00:06:57,073
姑娘  我差不多都有11個了
Oh, girl. I got, like, 11 of those.

125
00:06:57,157 --> 00:06:58,449
那個應該是防水的
That one's supposed to be waterproof.

126
00:06:58,533 --> 00:07:00,660
我跟你說  姑娘
Let me tell you, girl,

127
00:07:00,743 --> 00:07:04,497
你往它上面撒點狂暴果汁  會大事不妙
you get some Crunk Juice on that shit, not good.

128
00:07:00,743 --> 00:07:04,497
{\an8}紅牛加軒尼詩混合飲料


129
00:07:15,675 --> 00:07:18,428
看起來我們有麻煩了
Looks like we got a problem here.

130
00:07:18,511 --> 00:07:19,554
我沒問題的
I'm clean.

131
00:07:20,596 --> 00:07:22,015
嚴格來說  是的
Technically, yes.

132
00:07:23,099 --> 00:07:26,061
可是我不能讓你肌肉緊繃上飛機
But I can't let you on the plane with these guns.

133
00:07:26,144 --> 00:07:27,353
轉身
Turn around.

134
00:07:32,025 --> 00:07:33,901
能接到你的消息我很驚訝
I was surprised to get your note.

135
00:07:33,984 --> 00:07:35,903
老實說  萊瑞并不太合作
To be honest, Larry wasn't all that cooperative.

136
00:07:35,986 --> 00:07:38,226
萊瑞最近心情不太好
Well, Larry's in a weird place these days,

137
00:07:38,227 --> 00:07:39,907
可以說是我的錯
which is mostly my fault.

138
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:41,034
但我不能細說
But I can't get into that.

139
00:07:41,117 --> 00:07:44,245
跟我無關  我只是很高興他們讓我進來
It's none of my business. I'm just glad they let me in.

140
00:07:44,329 --> 00:07:46,122
有時候  低效率也挺好的
Sometimes, inefficiency works for you.

141
00:07:46,206 --> 00:07:47,915
事情是這樣的
Here's the thing.

142
00:07:47,998 --> 00:07:51,127
我奶奶病得很重  我應該獲得休假的
My grandmother is very sick, and I'm supposed to get furlough,

143
00:07:51,211 --> 00:07:53,296
可是看起來好像沒戲
but it doesn't seem to be happening.

144
00:07:53,379 --> 00:07:55,298
我不知道跟我有什么關系
I'm not sure where I come in.

145
00:07:55,381 --> 00:07:58,008
就是監獄制度不合理的典型案例
Just one example of how the prison system isn't working.

146
00:07:58,093 --> 00:08:02,012
警衛瀆職  濫用單獨禁閉
Guard misconduct, overuse of solitary confinement.

147
00:08:02,097 --> 00:08:05,391
外面的人應該知道里面是怎么回事
People on the outside should know what it's like.

148
00:08:05,475 --> 00:08:09,145
帕波  監獄對待犯人本來就不公平
Piper, prison treats inmates unfairly.

149
00:08:09,229 --> 00:08:10,869
如果周末不能放假回家探親
If not getting a weekend off to visit the family

150
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:11,689
是最糟糕的事
is the worst thing...

151
00:08:11,772 --> 00:08:13,233
我根本沒說
I didn't even remotely say...

152
00:08:13,316 --> 00:08:16,736
犯人挨餓  被強暴
Inmates are starving. They're getting raped.

153
00:08:16,819 --> 00:08:17,914
并非沒人報道
And it's not like no one's covering this.

154
00:08:17,915 --> 00:08:19,739
只是沒人在乎罷了
It's just that no one cares.

155
00:08:20,823 --> 00:08:22,617
聽著  我有過夜不能寐
Listen, do I lie awake

156
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:24,328
幻想憑一己之力
fantasizing about personally taking down an institution

157
00:08:24,411 --> 00:08:25,772
靠幾句鏗鏘有力的話
that is the single greatest stain

158
00:08:25,773 --> 00:08:27,913
就推翻自奴隸制之后
on the American collective conscience

159
00:08:27,997 --> 00:08:31,334
美國集體良知的最大污點嗎
since slavery with the awesome power of my words?

160
00:08:31,417 --> 00:08:32,418
當然
Sure.

161
00:08:32,502 --> 00:08:36,672
可是在白天  我接受現實  這不可能的
But in the daytime, I've accepted that's not gonna happen.

162
00:08:36,756 --> 00:08:39,134
我能做的  也許就是
What I can do, maybe,

163
00:08:39,217 --> 00:08:42,095
查明利奇菲爾德消失的兩百萬去了哪里
is find $2 million that's gone off the books here at Litchfield.

164
00:08:43,429 --> 00:08:44,514
你想要我做什么
What do you want me to do?

165
00:08:44,597 --> 00:08:47,057
如果錢被挪用了  肯定是用到了某處
If money's being appropriated, it has to be going somewhere.

166
00:08:47,142 --> 00:08:49,909
我猜錢都支付到一個
I'm guessing that there's some kind of shell corporation

167
00:08:49,909 --> 00:08:50,936
空殼公司去了
it's being paid into.

168
00:08:52,105 --> 00:08:54,524
電網的確有點問題
There is something going on with the electrical grid.

169
00:08:54,607 --> 00:08:56,401
這里都歸菲格羅亞管
Well, Figueroa's the official on the ground here,

170
00:08:56,484 --> 00:08:58,828
也就是說要么她被愚弄了
which means that she's either being duped

171
00:08:58,829 --> 00:09:00,321
要么她就是黑手
or she's in on the profits.

172
00:09:00,405 --> 00:09:02,885
我要知道誰跟她訂了協議
And I need to know who she's making contracts with

173
00:09:02,885 --> 00:09:04,117
誰干活  誰供貨
for labor, supplies,

174
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,368
她給誰開支票
who she's writing checks to.

175
00:09:05,451 --> 00:09:07,359
好吧  好的  我會去他們為了
Okay, cool. I'll just look that up 

176
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,013
方便我們調查我們感興趣的事
in the handy inmate Internet they give us for

177
00:09:09,014 --> 00:09:10,540
而提供的囚犯網絡上查查的
when we get curious about stuff.

178
00:09:10,623 --> 00:09:12,956
他們去年花了20萬美元
They appropriated $200,000 last year

179
00:09:12,957 --> 00:09:15,503
翻修了一個并不存在的健身房
to renovate a gym that doesn't exist.

180
00:09:15,586 --> 00:09:19,089
我很想幫你  我會幫你的
Look, I would love to help you. I really would.

181
00:09:19,174 --> 00:09:20,697
但是除了闖進菲格的辦公室
But short of breaking into Fig's office

182
00:09:20,697 --> 00:09:21,884
檢查她的文件
and going through her files,

183
00:09:21,967 --> 00:09:23,803
我不知道我該干什么
I'm not sure what I'm supposed to do.

184
00:09:23,886 --> 00:09:26,013
我已經被關過兩次禁閉了
I have been thrown in SHU twice already,

185
00:09:26,096 --> 00:09:29,058
我很愛我奶奶  她可能就要死了
and I love my grandmother, and she could die.

186
00:09:29,142 --> 00:09:30,637
我不會為了當個小間諜
I'm not gonna fuck things up for myself

187
00:09:29,142 --> 00:09:33,313
{\an8}美國喜劇電影


188
00:09:30,637 --> 00:09:33,313
冒大風險給自己惹麻煩
by playing high-stakes Harriet the Spy.

189
00:09:33,396 --> 00:09:36,316
好吧  如果你改變主意了就告訴我
Okay. Let me know if you change your mind.

190
00:09:39,277 --> 00:09:40,820
對你奶奶的情況表示遺憾
I'm sorry about your grandmother.

191
00:09:48,661 --> 00:09:50,413
你確定你就要做通常的發型
You sure you just want the usual?

192
00:09:50,496 --> 00:09:52,540
所以才叫"通常"嘛
That's why it's called "the usual".

193
00:09:52,623 --> 00:09:54,448
現在廚房都歸你管
I mean, you're running the kitchen now.

194
00:09:54,449 --> 00:09:56,502
你可以展示一下氣場
You got room for a statement.

195
00:09:56,586 --> 00:09:59,339
什么  我該把頭發染成紫紅色嗎
What, should I dye my hair fuchsia?

196
00:09:59,422 --> 00:10:02,967
是赤褐色  可惜不適合你
It's auburn. But not for you.

197
00:10:03,050 --> 00:10:05,508
我覺得一個勁爆的莫西干頭
I think a nice faux-hawk will give that

198
00:10:05,509 --> 00:10:08,514
就能告訴別人"別惹我"
"Don't fuck with me" vibe, you know?

199
00:10:08,598 --> 00:10:10,766
我主要靠臉來震懾別人
I mostly use my face for that.

200
00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:13,353
喂  發膠
Hey, Aqua Net,

201
00:10:13,436 --> 00:10:16,189
紅媽讓跟你說她開始種紫羅蘭了
Red said to tell you she's got violets growing.

202
00:10:17,315 --> 00:10:18,858
我難道應該在意這件事嗎  為什么
And I should give a shit about this, why?

203
00:10:18,941 --> 00:10:20,610
她說你會想知道的
She said you'd wanna know.

204
00:10:20,693 --> 00:10:22,069
她想種什么就種什么  我不
She can grow whatever she wants. I don't give a... 

205
00:10:22,152 --> 00:10:24,071
紫羅蘭
Violets.

206
00:10:24,154 --> 00:10:28,868
你是對的  我會去看看的
Oh. You're right. I'll come check that out.

207
00:10:31,704 --> 00:10:34,707
這里每天都讓我越來越困惑
Every day in this place, I get more confused.

208
00:10:49,347 --> 00:10:50,973
你帶券了嗎
Did you bring the stamps?

209
00:10:51,056 --> 00:10:52,057
你為什么不先說說
Why don't you first tell me

210
00:10:52,141 --> 00:10:54,018
是什么會讓我超級興奮
what I'm supposed to be so hair-on-fire excited about?

211
00:10:59,524 --> 00:11:01,859
聽著  多謝你的關心
Man, look, I appreciate your concern,

212
00:11:01,942 --> 00:11:05,070
不過我衛生巾夠用
but I'm actually well covered on the menstruation front.

213
00:11:05,154 --> 00:11:06,489
就來一支
Just take one.

214
00:11:18,709 --> 00:11:20,420
萬福瑪麗亞  你充滿圣寵
Hail Mary, full of grace.

215
00:11:26,175 --> 00:11:27,760
他媽的我要怎么點燃這個
Yeah, how the hell am I supposed to light this?

216
00:11:27,843 --> 00:11:29,512
要鉆木取火嗎
What, I gotta rub two sticks together or something?

217
00:11:32,932 --> 00:11:36,268
好好看著  利奇菲爾德牌打火機
Behold the Litchfield lighter.

218
00:11:38,563 --> 00:11:40,189
我勒個去
Get the fuck out.

219
00:11:51,701 --> 00:11:54,787
這可以算是我人生中排第三的好日子了
Man, it's like the third-best day of my entire life.

220
00:11:54,870 --> 00:11:56,497
往下水道里噴
Man, blow into the drain!

221
00:11:59,625 --> 00:12:01,961
然后評論家改了主意
What happened was the critic changed his mind

222
00:12:02,044 --> 00:12:04,714
因為燉老鼠很美味
because the rat made stew, and it was delicious.

223
00:12:04,797 --> 00:12:06,382
我明白
I understand that,

224
00:12:06,466 --> 00:12:09,469
不過光靠燉老鼠可開不了餐館
but that doesn't mean the rat can open a restaurant.

225
00:12:09,552 --> 00:12:12,012
衛生法典還是要遵守的
The health code is still the health code.

226
00:12:12,096 --> 00:12:14,139
你好像心死了
It's like you're dead inside.

227
00:12:14,223 --> 00:12:15,766
我聽說有什么紫羅蘭
Um, I heard something about violets?

228
00:12:15,850 --> 00:12:17,101
關門
Close the door.

229
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:33,033
你們居然會輸掉冷戰真是不可思議
It is a mystery to me how you people ever lost the Cold War.

230
00:12:33,117 --> 00:12:34,326
等等
But wait.

231
00:12:44,879 --> 00:12:46,672
用這個給我染發
This covers this.

232
00:12:48,966 --> 00:12:52,136
你有被一個六英尺高的變性黑女人吻過嗎
You ever been kissed by a 6-foot, black, transgender woman?

233
00:12:52,219 --> 00:12:55,890
不用了  謝謝  不過我的小賣部需要幫忙
I'm good, thanks. But my commissary could use some love.

234
00:12:57,182 --> 00:12:59,894
不是以貨換服務嗎
Whatever happened to goods for services?

235
00:12:59,977 --> 00:13:02,605
我手頭的現金有點吃緊
I'm running a little dry in the cash department.

236
00:13:02,688 --> 00:13:04,565
你的貨流渠道很穩定吧
You got a steady channel, I assume?

237
00:13:04,649 --> 00:13:05,941
你想要什么就有什么
Whatever you want.

238
00:13:07,026 --> 00:13:08,318
如果要求合理
Within reason.

239
00:13:09,361 --> 00:13:10,821
我會回來的
I'll be back.

240
00:13:38,641 --> 00:13:40,392
你在開玩笑吧
You cannot be serious.

241
00:13:48,568 --> 00:13:49,652
弗洛雷斯
Flores!

242
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:52,822
弗洛雷斯
Flores!

243
00:14:01,872 --> 00:14:03,708
那堆拉美人連像樣的米飯和豆子都做不好
Bunch of Latinas can't make decent rice and beans.

244
00:14:03,791 --> 00:14:04,834
到底是哪里出了問題
What's wrong with this picture?

245
00:14:04,917 --> 00:14:06,794
我是吃中餐長大的
I grew up eating Chinese.

246
00:14:06,877 --> 00:14:10,965
那時候我繼父叫陳東  他有好多頭皮屑
My stepdad from then was named Chen Dong. He had so much dandruff.

247
00:14:11,048 --> 00:14:12,049
就是那個黑胡椒
It's that black pepper.

248
00:14:12,132 --> 00:14:14,844
盒裝的爛貨  嘗起來就像我外婆的骨灰
The shit that comes in boxes, it tastes like my abuela's ashes.

249
00:14:14,927 --> 00:14:17,346
有次我叔叔烤了只被他碾死的穿山甲
One time my uncle cooked an armadillo he hit with his car.

250
00:14:17,429 --> 00:14:18,514
味道還不錯
It tastes okay

251
00:14:18,598 --> 00:14:20,808
不過得放點辣椒醬才行
but you gotta put Cholula on it.

252
00:14:21,892 --> 00:14:23,644
-現在有點忙  -抱歉  我該不該
- Kind of busy right now. - Sorry. Should I... 

253
00:14:23,728 --> 00:14:25,187
圣誕老人
Santa?

254
00:14:25,270 --> 00:14:26,856
圣誕老人個鬼
Fuck Santa.

255
00:14:26,939 --> 00:14:27,982
本尼特比圣誕老人帥氣
Bennett's better looking

256
00:14:28,065 --> 00:14:29,650
哪怕你不守規矩他也會給你禮物
and he shows up even if you've been naughty.

257
00:14:31,068 --> 00:14:32,069
你那是什么
What'd you get?

258
00:14:32,152 --> 00:14:34,029
這些玩意越來越小巧玲瓏了
Oh, these things just keep getting smaller.

259
00:14:34,113 --> 00:14:35,114
其實都是我的
That's actually mine.

260
00:14:35,197 --> 00:14:36,866
你可以借幾天  但我要拿回來的
You can borrow it for a few days, but I'm gonna need it back.

261
00:14:36,949 --> 00:14:39,660
都是艦隊狐貍的歌
Ugh. It's full of Fleet Foxes and shit.

262
00:14:39,744 --> 00:14:41,787
-我的手機呢  -白人妞  現實點
- What about my phone? - Blanca, be real.

263
00:14:41,871 --> 00:14:44,081
聽著  這是我最后一次這么做了
Look, this is the last time that I can do this.

264
00:14:44,164 --> 00:14:47,292
好吧  我不要手機  我要色情雜志
Okay, fuck the phone but I want porn.

265
00:14:47,376 --> 00:14:50,212
老兄  弗洛雷斯真他媽是個天才
Oh, man. Flores is a fucking genius!

266
00:14:50,295 --> 00:14:51,601
好吧  不過要高檔點的
Okay, but good porn.

267
00:14:51,602 --> 00:14:53,382
不要日本人那種變態的瞎扯淡

我要只有男人的雜志

And plus, I don't wanna be exploiting women and shit.

271
00:15:02,266 --> 00:15:03,433
一點性欲都沒有
It sucks out all the sexy.

272
00:15:03,518 --> 00:15:04,894
我不會買同性戀色情雜志的
I'm not buying gay porn.

273
00:15:04,977 --> 00:15:06,436
你是恐同人士嗎
Are you homophobic or something?

274
00:15:06,521 --> 00:15:07,557
各位  夠了
Suficiente, everyone!

275

外面都是餓肚子的人  快點
We got hungry people out there. Vamos!

276
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:12,359
我大概會餓死
I may starve to death.

277
00:15:13,486 --> 00:15:15,320
不用說  我是素食主義者
I'm a vegetarian, obviously.

278
00:15:15,404 --> 00:15:18,574
我表示尊重  但是  此時此地
You know, and I respect that, but under the present circumstances,

279
00:15:18,658 --> 00:15:20,325
我相當肯定  即使是
I'm pretty sure that even...

保羅·麥卡特尼也會對金槍魚砂鍋投降的
even Paul McCartney would be all up in a tuna casserole.

281
00:15:20,409 --> 00:15:23,496
{\an8}甲殼蟲樂隊樂手  素食主義者


282
00:15:23,579 --> 00:15:26,582
看那個沙拉  就是冰凍豌豆和卷心萵苣
Look. That salad bar, it's just frozen peas and iceberg lettuce.

283

你覺得我和岡薩雷斯
You think that me and Gonzales

286

-是的  再好不過了  -好吧
- Yeah, sure. That would be great. - Okay.

288
00:15:37,342 --> 00:15:38,719
雖然可能有點奇怪
This might be weird,

289
00:15:38,803 --> 00:15:43,432
但是你知道廚房的供貨商嗎
but do you know anything about the kitchen vendors?

290
00:15:43,516 --> 00:15:46,101
比如雜貨是哪個公司送的
Like which company delivers the groceries?

291
00:15:46,185 --> 00:15:47,186
開卡車的人嗎
Some guys in a truck.

292

你吃蛋嗎
Do you eat eggs?

295
00:15:52,858 --> 00:15:54,860
那要看它是怎么被飼養的
Depends on how they were raised.

296
00:15:54,944 --> 00:15:56,236
不吃唄
So, no.

297
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,988
你想拿我開玩笑就開
Okay, make fun of me if you want,

298
00:15:58,072 --> 00:15:59,768
但是這個國家的農產品行業

299
00:15:59,769 --> 00:16:00,616
真是完全瘋了
is completely insane.

300
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:02,451
賤人  看看你周圍
Bitch, look around you.

301

我們在監獄里
We in the prison-business complex.

302
00:16:04,579 --> 00:16:06,299
如果奶牛能讓我離開這里
A cow breaks me out of here,

303
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:07,707
那我就不再吃肉
I'll stop eating meat that day.

304
00:16:08,874 --> 00:16:10,835
是真的嗎
Is it true?

305
00:16:10,918 --> 00:16:14,213
非洲的天主教牧師允許結婚
That the Catholic priests in Africa are allowed to get married

306
00:16:14,296 --> 00:16:17,800
就因為對他們而言守貞太難
because chastity's just too hard for them?

307
00:16:17,883 --> 00:16:19,176
我覺得對每個人而言都很難
I think it's hard for anyone.

308
00:16:19,259 --> 00:16:21,804
對  但要是非洲男人
Yeah, but African men?

309
00:16:21,887 --> 00:16:24,223
那又是另當別論了
That's a whole other story.

310
00:16:26,058 --> 00:16:28,644
我相信你的話  失陪了
I'll take your word for it. Excuse me.

就是我有低血糖  你記得嗎
It's that darn blood-sugar thing. You remember.

313

我得給你記上一筆
I'm gonna have to write you a shot.

314
00:16:41,073 --> 00:16:42,575
你要給修女記過
You'd give a shot to a nun?

315
00:16:44,076 --> 00:16:45,745
不要恨我
Don't hate me.

316
00:16:45,828 --> 00:16:47,747
我還從來沒有被記過過
I've never gotten a shot before.

317
00:16:48,789 --> 00:16:51,917
好日子到頭了  真的
It's the end of days. I'm telling you.

318
00:17:05,598 --> 00:17:06,724

319
00:17:12,187 --> 00:17:14,106
-需要幫忙嗎  -哦

321
00:17:18,611 --> 00:17:20,237
不客氣
You're welcome.

322
00:17:21,906 --> 00:17:24,033
昨晚我看見我丈夫了
I saw my husband last night.

323
00:17:24,116 --> 00:17:26,201
聽起來真不錯
Well, that sounds lovely.

324
00:17:26,285 --> 00:17:28,037
他現在玩貝斯了
He plays the bass now.

325
00:17:31,290 --> 00:17:32,708
別忘了擦這些鞋子
Don't forget to shine those shoes.

326
00:17:32,792 --> 00:17:36,378
我說過會給你理床  但不包括這些鞋子
Now, I said I'd clean your bunk. The shoes are not included.

327
00:17:36,461 --> 00:17:38,422
我雖不是科學家什么的
I ain't saying I'm no scientist or nothing,

328
00:17:38,505 --> 00:17:40,507
但鞋子也在這個床鋪里  對嗎
but the shoes in the bunk, correct?

329
00:17:40,590 --> 00:17:43,260
光是待在這兒我可能就會被記過
Look, I'm gonna get a shot for even being in here.

330
00:17:43,343 --> 00:17:46,764
如果我要再次面對紀律仲裁委員會
If I have to go in front of the disciplinary board one more time... 

331
00:17:52,269 --> 00:17:54,396
因果報應  你們白人是自食其果
You know, karma-wise, your people had this coming.

332
00:17:54,479 --> 00:17:56,523
行了  這就是我能拿到的
Okay, yo. Here's what I got.

333
00:17:58,734 --> 00:18:04,073
等等  我明確說過要草莓的
Oh, hold up. I specifically said strawberry.

334
00:18:04,156 --> 00:18:05,170
我們沒草莓的了
Well, we're out of strawberry right now.

335
00:18:05,171 --> 00:18:06,909
那是我能拿到最好的了
That's the best I could do, all right?

336
00:18:06,992 --> 00:18:08,368
我知道的是
All I know is... 

337
00:18:14,333 --> 00:18:15,751
我手里有高級貨
I'm holding some premium shit here.

338
00:18:15,835 --> 00:18:17,586
賤人  我不抽煙好嗎
Bitch, I don't even smoke, okay?

339
00:18:17,670 --> 00:18:19,588
我要用它收買阿蕾達  讓她借我熱水管
I need it to bribe Aleida to let me borrow her stinger

340
00:18:19,672 --> 00:18:21,048

so I can wax my mustache.

341
00:18:23,050 --> 00:18:25,720
幸虧你遇到我心情不錯

對一個九歲孩子而言有點過了
A little much for a 9-year-old.

353
00:18:52,246 --> 00:18:55,624
你要是想說有點招搖  那你就說對了
Yeah, if you mean a little much swagger, you got that right!

354
00:18:55,708 --> 00:18:57,751
我希望你能陪我過每個生日

你擔心什么
What you so nervous about?

363
00:19:14,268 --> 00:19:17,146
你以為呢  我昨天才認識你嗎
What you think, I met you yesterday?

364
00:19:17,229 --> 00:19:20,649
我會看著她的  我保證

I don't want you losin' it or gettin' it stolen.

368
00:19:29,784 --> 00:19:31,744
我們快走吧
Let's blow this joint!

369
00:19:33,203 --> 00:19:35,748
-辛迪  -我知道
- Cindy. - I know.

370
00:19:56,018 --> 00:19:59,354
查普曼  我就是想
Hey, Chapman, I was just wondering

371
00:19:59,438 --> 00:20:03,692
你的簡報委員會還缺不缺人
if maybe you got any room on your newsletter committee,

372
00:20:03,776 --> 00:20:05,861
也許我也可以加入嗎
that maybe I could join up?

373
00:20:05,945 --> 00:20:08,738
我想想  目前就我和兩個西班牙姑娘
Let me see. So far, it's me and two Spanish girls,

374
00:20:08,823 --> 00:20:12,034
其中一個有點把我嚇到了  所以  行
one of whom scares me a little bit, so, yeah.

375
00:20:12,117 --> 00:20:13,786
我想我可以把你排進來
Yeah, I think I can squeeze you in.

376
00:20:13,869 --> 00:20:15,704
真的太棒了
Oh, that's really good.

377
00:20:15,788 --> 00:20:18,290
你有什么特別想寫的嗎
Is there anything in particular that you wanna write about?

378
00:20:19,333 --> 00:20:21,751
我還沒想那么遠
Uh, I didn't really get that far.

379
00:20:21,836 --> 00:20:25,672
我只是覺得讓自己忙起來會比較好
I just thought it'd be good to keep busy, you know?

380
00:20:25,755 --> 00:20:27,007
寫寫愛情小說怎么樣
Well, what about romance?

381
00:20:28,050 --> 00:20:29,316
像是長篇連載什么的
Like a serial type of thing?

382
00:20:29,317 --> 00:20:31,428
狄更斯跟丹尼爾·斯蒂爾混合體
Dickens meets Danielle Steel.

383
00:20:31,511 --> 00:20:35,432
我不想去碰愛情類的東西
I'm trying to stay away from the romance-type stuff,

384
00:20:35,515 --> 00:20:37,601
-就是這一陣子  -哦
- just for a little while. - Oh.

385
00:20:38,643 --> 00:20:43,190
沒事  只是  也許可以寫寫其他的
Oh, yeah. No, it's fine. It's just, maybe something else.

386
00:20:44,817 --> 00:20:46,693
很操蛋  對吧
It's fucked up, isn't it?

387
00:20:46,776 --> 00:20:48,083
我們被困在這里
How we're stuck in here

388
00:20:48,084 --> 00:20:50,697
可是外面的世界不斷在變化
and the world outside just keeps turning?

389
00:20:51,698 --> 00:20:53,075
是啊
Yeah.

你知道  雖然你在監獄里
Well, you know, just 'cause you're in prison

393
00:21:02,501 --> 00:21:04,336
但并不意味著你就能不管不顧了
don't mean you got to let it go.

394
00:21:04,419 --> 00:21:07,047
我敢肯定你有些很好的美容心得
I bet that you have some great tips.

395
00:21:07,131 --> 00:21:13,345
好吧  好吧  我可以寫  我可以寫
Okay. Okay. I can do it. I can do that.

A fag. You know, a drag. A butt. A burn.

00:21:32,489 --> 00:21:35,034
你是說香煙  你跑錯地方了
Look, you talking about cigarettes, you're at the wrong house.

400
00:21:36,994 --> 00:21:37,812
拜托
Come on, I'm not the one

401
00:21:37,812 --> 00:21:39,955
又不是我開了黑人煙館
who started a Negro-League Tobacco Shack, all right?

402
00:21:40,039 --> 00:21:41,123
那是你的好朋友  維
That would be your pal Vee.

403
00:21:41,206 --> 00:21:43,125
我只是想弄點好貨
I merely seek to avail myself of a fine product.

404
00:21:43,208 --> 00:21:44,626
她不是我朋友
She ain't my pal.

405
00:21:44,709 --> 00:21:46,086
她朋友跟你朋友在一起
She's pals with your pals.

406
00:21:46,170 --> 00:21:48,722
對  她就是利用你們給她賣命
Right, or she's using them to do her dirt

407
00:21:48,723 --> 00:21:50,424
她只要數錢就行了
while she counts the cash.

408
00:21:50,507 --> 00:21:52,592
她不會被發現跟違禁品有任何關系
You ain't gonna find her hands on no contraband.

409
00:21:52,676 --> 00:21:54,386
你看著吧  如果有人因為運貨被抓
You watch, somebody goes down for carrying,

410
00:21:54,469 --> 00:21:56,805
她會在獄警面前裝傻陪笑
she'll be shuffling and smiling in front of the COs like,

411
00:21:56,889 --> 00:21:58,432
"上帝  這些姑娘干什么壞事了"
"Oh, Lord, what have these girls got up to?"

412
00:22:00,392 --> 00:22:01,726
媽的
Fuck.

413
00:22:06,982 --> 00:22:10,402
你知道高中生女同性戀的遭遇嗎
Hey, you know that thing that happens to lesbians in high school?

414
00:22:10,485 --> 00:22:12,862
我們和喜歡的直女
How we strike up a really intense best-friendship

415
00:22:12,947 --> 00:22:14,864
建立起親密的閨蜜關系的
with a straight girl who's really into it.

416
00:22:14,949 --> 00:22:18,160
我們會勸自己能做朋友就很好  對嗎
And we convince ourselves that friends is good, right?

417
00:22:18,243 --> 00:22:20,287
直到她有了男朋友
Until she gets a boyfriend.

418
00:22:20,370 --> 00:22:21,486
我們討厭那個缺德鬼
We hate that poor asshole

419
00:22:21,486 --> 00:22:23,415
討厭到天怒人怨
with the white-hot heat of a thousand suns,

420
00:22:23,498 --> 00:22:25,667
還說些"他配不上你"之類的話
a "He's not worthy of you," or whatever,

421
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:29,004
盡管他可能是個相當不錯的人
when he's probably a decent-enough person, i mean, as guys go.

422
00:22:29,088 --> 00:22:30,255
因為我們
Because what's really happening

423
00:22:30,256 --> 00:22:33,175
其實是愛上了我們的朋友
is that we're in love with our friend.

424
00:22:33,258 --> 00:22:37,887
為什么大家都覺得我愛上了她  我沒有
Yo, why does everybody think I'm in love with her? 'Cause I'm not.

425
00:22:37,972 --> 00:22:40,515
當然  當然  你要這么想就這么想吧
Sure. Sure. Let's go with that.

426
00:22:43,477 --> 00:22:45,895
不過如果你的確是喜歡她
But in the event that you were having the feels for her?

427
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:47,606
你討厭她的男朋友
Yeah, it turns out that by hating her boyfriend,

428
00:22:47,689 --> 00:22:48,815
其實只會把她從你身邊推開
you're just gonna drive her away.

429
00:22:48,898 --> 00:22:51,860
你得接受這件事并讓他喜歡你
I mean, you gotta suck it up and make him like you.

430
00:22:51,943 --> 00:22:55,280
打打牌  把《教父》看十遍什么的
Take up poker. Watch The Godfather 10 times or whatever.

431
00:22:55,364 --> 00:22:57,407
各位  警報解除  我們找到了
All clear, everybody. We found it.

432
00:22:58,993 --> 00:23:00,425
不管怎樣  這是你的人生
Anyway, it's your life.

433
00:23:00,426 --> 00:23:01,620
你想怎么揮霍都行
I mean, spend it how you want, all right?

434
00:23:09,544 --> 00:23:12,297
你的袋子呢  圣誕老人
Ay, where's your sack, Santa?

435
00:23:13,882 --> 00:23:15,467
我做不到
Couldn't do it.

436
00:23:15,550 --> 00:23:17,177
好吧  我再也不會這么做了
Okay, I'm not doing this anymore.

437
00:23:17,261 --> 00:23:19,054
我看你是忘了敲詐是怎么回事了  老大
I think you forgot how blackmail works, papi.

438
00:23:19,138 --> 00:23:21,056
我看你是忘了監獄是怎么回事了
I think you forgot how prison works.

439
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:22,766
這太過分了  好嗎
This shit has gone too far, okay?

440
00:23:22,849 --> 00:23:26,145
你知道還有誰很過分嗎  你跟達婭娜
You know who else went too far? You with Dayanara.

441
00:23:27,646 --> 00:23:30,649
好吧  這個怎么樣
Fine. How about this?

442
00:23:30,732 --> 00:23:31,733
你們都被記過了
You're all getting shots.

443
00:23:31,816 --> 00:23:33,068
我什么都沒干  混蛋
Yo, I didn't do nothing, asshole.

444
00:23:33,152 --> 00:23:34,403
好吧  那你真可憐
Well, that sucks for you.

445
00:23:34,486 --> 00:23:35,758
你他媽是在跟我開玩笑吧
You gotta be fucking kidding me, right?

446
00:23:35,759 --> 00:23:37,031
我發誓我沒在開玩笑
I promise you I'm not kidding.

447
00:23:37,114 --> 00:23:38,240
本尼特
Hey, Bennett,

448
00:23:38,323 --> 00:23:41,076
如果卡普托發現你強奸了囚犯會怎么樣
what's gonna happen when Caputo finds out you raped an inmate?

449
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:42,952
-他不會發現的  -你確定
- He's not gonna find out. - You sure about that?

450
00:23:43,037 --> 00:23:43,566
對  我很確定
Yeah, I'm pretty sure.

451
00:23:43,567 --> 00:23:45,080
因為你馬上要被關禁閉了  拉莫斯
'Cause you're going to the SHU, Ramos.

452
00:23:45,164 --> 00:23:47,666
-為什么  -我要再想想
- For what? - I'll figure it out later.

453
00:23:47,749 --> 00:23:50,544
-你不會那么對我的  -你覺得我不會
- You ain't gonna do that to me. - You think I'm not?

454
00:23:50,627 --> 00:23:52,504
走  動作快點
Let's go. Move it!

455
00:23:52,587 --> 00:23:54,798
媽的
Shit!

456
00:23:54,881 --> 00:23:56,258
你要跟她一起關禁閉
You wanna join her?

457
00:24:00,011 --> 00:24:01,680
再見
Bye.

458
00:24:01,763 --> 00:24:03,848
沒想到這雜種還有這膽子
I didn't think that fucker had it in him.

459
00:24:11,565 --> 00:24:12,941
我聽說你想見我
I heard you wanted to see me?

460
00:24:13,024 --> 00:24:15,110
查普曼  對的  請進
Uh, Chapman. Right. Come in.

461
00:24:15,194 --> 00:24:16,791
卡普托先生  你有沒有
Mr. Caputo, have you, um,

462
00:24:16,792 --> 00:24:19,114
聽到關于我休假申請的事
heard anything about my furlough request?

463
00:24:19,198 --> 00:24:21,032
那不歸我管  抱歉
It's not my department. Sorry.

464
00:24:22,076 --> 00:24:24,244
不過我在考慮你的簡報的事
But I've been thinking about this newsletter.

465
00:24:25,204 --> 00:24:26,288
很棒
Awesome.

466
00:24:26,371 --> 00:24:28,077
我想這會是一個很好的渠道
I've been thinking it could be a good way

467
00:24:28,078 --> 00:24:30,125
讓我們管理層
for us, the administration,

468
00:24:30,209 --> 00:24:32,276
能夠跟你們囚犯進行溝通
to communicate with the inmates.

469
00:24:32,277 --> 00:24:34,171
來解釋我們的立場
Explain our side of things.

470
00:24:35,297 --> 00:24:37,216
你的立場是什么
Your side of what?

471
00:24:38,258 --> 00:24:41,678
例如  現在實行的記過配額指標
For instance, this shot-quota thing we got going.

472
00:24:41,761 --> 00:24:43,159
你們覺得我們刻薄
You ladies think we're being mean.

473
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:45,432
但我們只是做了本職工作
But we're just doing our job, you know?

474
00:24:45,515 --> 00:24:48,893
事情變得失控  對大家都沒好處
Things get out of hand, it's bad for everybody.

475
00:24:49,853 --> 00:24:51,646
法西斯主義也是這么說的
That's kind of what fascists say.

476
00:24:53,398 --> 00:24:55,942
我媽媽那邊可能跟墨索里尼沾親
I may be related to Mussolini on my mother's side.

477
00:24:58,195 --> 00:24:59,238
開個玩笑
It's a joke.

478
00:25:00,405 --> 00:25:03,408
也許你可以在簡報里寫點警衛的事
Maybe you could put something in the newsletter about the guards.

479
00:25:03,492 --> 00:25:05,452
說明我們大家都是人
Show everybody we're human.

480
00:25:05,535 --> 00:25:07,579
警衛  和我們一樣
"Guards, they're just like us."

481
00:25:08,747 --> 00:25:09,831
這就有點過了
I wouldn't go that far.

482
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:13,418
這個怎么樣  "警衛
How about, "Guards... 

483
00:25:15,212 --> 00:25:16,838
他們也是人"
they're people, too"?

484
00:25:19,090 --> 00:25:20,425
那么
So, uh... 

485
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:24,471
告訴我
tell me... 

486
00:25:26,223 --> 00:25:28,016
你業余時間喜歡干什么
what do you like to do in your spare time?

487
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:40,779
你好
Hi.

488
00:25:40,862 --> 00:25:42,864
-你是怎么回事啊  -好多事呢
- What is the matter with you? - So much.

489
00:25:42,947 --> 00:25:44,949
你性致高昂地出現在我家
You show up at my house like fucking Squiggy with a hard-on.

490
00:25:45,033 --> 00:25:47,039
你下次決定向丈夫最近才買了阿留申群島狩獵矛
Maybe next time you decide to make some deranged declaration

491
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:49,496
而且乳導管堵塞的感情白癡
of love to an emotional zombie with a blocked milk duct

492
00:25:49,579 --> 00:25:52,291
發表瘋狂的愛的宣言的時候
and a husband who recently purchased an Aleutian hunting spear,

493
00:25:52,374 --> 00:25:53,792
能先給我打個電話嗎
you could consider calling first?

494
00:25:53,875 --> 00:25:57,712
好吧  聽著  波麗  我有點失控了
Okay, look, Polly, I'm spiraling out, okay? I am.

495
00:25:57,796 --> 00:26:00,590
你知道有時候人設想生活應該是怎么樣的
You know, you have this idea of what your life is supposed to... 

496
00:26:00,674 --> 00:26:01,883
不  我辦不到  拉瑞
No, I can't do this, Larry!

497
00:26:01,966 --> 00:26:03,051
好吧
Okay.

498
00:26:03,134 --> 00:26:05,011
我認真的  這太傻逼了
I'm serious. It's just stupid.

499
00:26:05,094 --> 00:26:06,180
我知道
I know.

500
00:26:06,263 --> 00:26:06,680
沒錯
I mean, yes,

501
00:26:06,681 --> 00:26:09,391
我們跟皮特和帕波約會前就是朋友
we were friends before we even started dating Pete and Piper.

502
00:26:09,474 --> 00:26:11,726
我臨產的時候  是你把我送到醫院
And yes, you drove me to the hospital when I was in labor

503
00:26:11,810 --> 00:26:14,145
辦理了所有的書面材料  還細心照看我
and handled all the paperwork and the nurses.

504
00:26:14,229 --> 00:26:15,514
當我丈夫消失不見
And yes, you were the only one there for me

505
00:26:15,597 --> 00:26:16,665
去執行為期一個月的自我探索任務時
when my husband checked out of fatherhood

506
00:26:16,748 --> 00:26:19,693
你是唯一在我身邊幫我的人
so he could go on a month-long mission of self-exploration,

507
00:26:19,776 --> 00:26:23,822
你很風趣  又恰到好處的一本正經
and you're funny, but also boring in all the right ways, and... 

508
00:26:23,905 --> 00:26:26,283
我到底在說什么  操我吧
What the hell am I saying? Just fuck me.

509
00:26:30,787 --> 00:26:33,748
-我不知道這意味著什么  -閉嘴
- I don't know what this means. - Shut up.

510
00:26:33,832 --> 00:26:35,459
好吧  聽著  聽著
Okay, listen, listen.

511
00:26:35,542 --> 00:26:37,419
我好幾個月沒有性生活了
I haven't had sex in months,

512
00:26:37,502 --> 00:26:39,504
所以我比較有可能
so there's a better-than-average chance that I could... 

513
00:26:39,588 --> 00:26:40,922
閉嘴  拉瑞
Just shut the fuck up, Larry.

514
00:26:47,011 --> 00:26:48,722
你有說過什么乳導管堵塞嗎
Did you say something about a blocked milk duct?

515
00:26:48,805 --> 00:26:50,181
玩右邊那個就好
Just stay to the right.

516
00:26:53,852 --> 00:26:55,354
就像寄信一樣
It's like sending a letter.

517
00:26:55,437 --> 00:26:58,273
有個窗口  你輸入問題答案就出來了
There's a box, you type in a question, and the answer comes up.

518
00:26:58,357 --> 00:27:00,317
是誰在另一端查答案
Who's on the other end looking it up?

519
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:04,613
沒人  都在電線里
Nobody. It's in the wires.

520
00:27:04,696 --> 00:27:08,157
里面有世界上所有的信息
It's all the information in the world.

521
00:27:08,242 --> 00:27:12,954
你說世界上所有的信息都藏在電線里
You're telling me all the information in the world is in wires?

522
00:27:14,706 --> 00:27:16,625
但是人們還是很愚蠢  對嗎
But people are still stupid, right?

523
00:27:19,378 --> 00:27:22,756
紅媽  我需要些火柴
Hey, Red. I could really use some matches.

524
00:27:22,839 --> 00:27:23,882
火柴
Matches.

525
00:27:23,965 --> 00:27:25,300
-對  -很好
- Yeah. - Good.

526
00:27:25,384 --> 00:27:28,209
我剛還在想我們死在
I was just thinking our chances of dying

527
00:27:28,210 --> 00:27:33,224
瘋子縱火犯的燃燒彈下的幾率還不夠高呢
in some nut-job arsonist's fire bomb weren't high enough already.

528
00:27:33,308 --> 00:27:35,644
我不會讓其他任何人接觸到它們的
I wouldn't let anyone else touch 'em.

529
00:27:35,727 --> 00:27:37,437
拜托  我只是想抽支煙
Come on. I'm just trying to get my smoke on.

530
00:27:37,521 --> 00:27:42,066
你有什么可抽呢
And what exactly are you smoking?

531
00:27:43,067 --> 00:27:45,153
黑人有香煙
The black girls got cigs.

532
00:27:45,236 --> 00:27:46,209
你需要打手
You need muscle,

533
00:27:46,210 --> 00:27:48,156
塔斯利茲曾用斧頭砍死過人
Taslitz killed a guy with an ax.

534
00:27:48,239 --> 00:27:50,450
那時候她還沒得關節炎
That was before the arthritis.

535
00:27:51,743 --> 00:27:53,603
大波  雖然我很想幫你
Boo, much as I'd like to help you

536
00:27:53,688 --> 00:27:57,666
讓你下半輩子都關禁閉  可是我沒空
spend the rest of your life in solitary, I'm busy.

537
00:27:57,749 --> 00:27:58,945
你待會兒過來
Come back later

538
00:27:58,946 --> 00:28:02,296
我會考慮給你點曲奇什么的
and I'll see about getting you some cookies or something.

539
00:28:04,839 --> 00:28:06,215
真是的
Oh, man.

540
00:28:08,134 --> 00:28:09,928
記一過  犯人
That's a shot, inmate.

541
00:28:10,011 --> 00:28:11,137
為什么
For what?

542
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:12,597
損壞公共財物
Damaging government property.

543
00:28:12,681 --> 00:28:14,308
胡說八道  你心里清楚得很
That is horse shit, and you know it.

544
00:28:14,391 --> 00:28:15,767
你還想記一筆罵臟話嗎
You want one for obscenity, too?

545
00:28:23,191 --> 00:28:25,527
我覺得羅娜可以擔任副主編
So, I'm thinking that Lorna can be assistant editor,

546
00:28:25,610 --> 00:28:27,779
幫我們想想寫點什么話題
help us come up with ideas of things to write about

547
00:28:27,862 --> 00:28:28,863
還有誰來寫
and people to write them.

548
00:28:28,947 --> 00:28:30,574
所以你讓兩個白人妞來負責
So you got two white girls in charge?

549
00:28:30,657 --> 00:28:32,158
該死的
Ah, shit.

550
00:28:32,241 --> 00:28:34,453
我覺得應該讓有能力的人擔任  就這些
I just think it should be based on who earned it, is all.

551
00:28:34,536 --> 00:28:36,413
我高中負責過年鑒  所以
I did yearbook in high school, so... 

552
00:28:36,496 --> 00:28:38,415
年鑒根本不是正式刊物
Yearbook isn't even a real class.

553
00:28:38,498 --> 00:28:42,752
就是拍點照片  抽點大麻  大家都懂
You just take photographs and smoke weed. Everybody knows that.

554
00:28:42,836 --> 00:28:45,547
不管怎樣  我已經寫了一個專欄
Anyway, I already wrote a column.

555
00:28:45,630 --> 00:28:47,882
-我看看  -喂
- Let me see. - Hey.

556
00:28:47,966 --> 00:28:49,718
這是我畫的
Look, I drew this.

557
00:28:49,801 --> 00:28:51,266
是關于監獄里的情況
It's about being in jail with,

558
00:28:51,267 --> 00:28:53,221
用動物園里的動物作比
like, animals at the zoo.

559
00:28:56,308 --> 00:28:58,393
為什么海象的心情這么差
Why is the walrus in such a bad mood?

560
00:28:58,477 --> 00:29:01,480
那是海利先生
Oh. That's, um, Mr. Healy.

561
00:29:01,563 --> 00:29:02,939
精彩絕倫
This is fantastic.

562
00:29:03,022 --> 00:29:05,233
-你已經寫錯了  -誰說的
- You already made your first mistake. - Says who?

563
00:29:05,317 --> 00:29:06,824
如果你能"少在乎一點"
If you "could care less,"

564
00:29:05,317 --> 00:29:08,194
{\an8}在口語里是couldn't care less的訛用


565
00:29:06,825 --> 00:29:08,194
說明你還是在乎的
that means you still care.

566
00:29:08,277 --> 00:29:09,654
懂嗎
You know what I'm saying?

567
00:29:09,655 --> 00:29:11,490
你當然可以少在乎一點
'Cause, like, it is possible for you to care less.

568
00:29:11,573 --> 00:29:15,602
不對不對  我是說無論你有多在乎
No. No. I'm saying is however much you care,

569
00:29:15,603 --> 00:29:18,121
我都不在乎
I could care less than you.

570
00:29:18,204 --> 00:29:20,499
這句話不是這個意思
That's not what it means.

571
00:29:20,582 --> 00:29:23,418
你應該說"我一點也不在乎"  懂嗎
It should be, "I couldn't care less." See?

572
00:29:23,502 --> 00:29:26,505
因為你的結論還是在乎的
Because you hit bottom with caring.

573
00:29:26,588 --> 00:29:28,757
查普曼  跟她說說
Yo, Chapman, tell her.

574
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:30,925
嚴格來說  是的
I mean, technically, yes.

575
00:29:31,009 --> 00:29:33,928
但我覺得就像"照字面意思"這個詞一樣
But I think this is one of those things like "literally",

576
00:29:31,009 --> 00:29:33,931
{\an8}口語中常表示真的  確實


577
00:29:34,012 --> 00:29:36,931
最后總是越口語化的用法越被人接受
where the colloquial usage of the word eventually wins out.

578
00:29:37,015 --> 00:29:38,266
語言是不斷發展的
Languages evolve.

579
00:29:38,350 --> 00:29:39,768
你為什么要那樣
Why you gotta be like that?

580
00:29:39,851 --> 00:29:44,898
關鍵是每個人都知道我要說什么
Look, the point is everybody knows what I'm trying to say.

581
00:29:44,981 --> 00:29:46,941
你為什么非要犯渾呢
Why you gotta be a dick about it?

582
00:29:47,025 --> 00:29:48,693
那叫語法  蠢貨
It's called grammar, tonta.

583
00:29:48,777 --> 00:29:50,445
我很高興我總算找到你了  羅伯塔
I'm so glad I found you, Roberta.

584
00:29:50,529 --> 00:29:53,281
-你還好嗎  -不好  我被人跟蹤了
- Are you okay? - No. I'm being followed.

585
00:29:53,365 --> 00:29:56,034
是該死的愛爾蘭人  我不能回大房間去
It's the damn Irish. I can't go back to the pen.

586
00:29:56,117 --> 00:29:57,243
不準肢體接觸  卡瓦諾
No touching, Cavanaugh.

587
00:30:03,207 --> 00:30:05,043
太悲哀了
Oh, that is so sad.

588
00:30:06,711 --> 00:30:08,713
你打算寫什么
What are you gonna write about?

589
00:30:08,797 --> 00:30:12,467
我在考慮  建議專欄
I was thinking, like, an advice column.

590
00:30:12,551 --> 00:30:14,469
大家寫下自己的問題
People write about their problems,

591
00:30:14,553 --> 00:30:16,137
然后我會讓她們振作起來
and then I tell them to get their shit together.

592
00:30:17,597 --> 00:30:21,267
有一堆棒球類的呢  我最喜歡了
Mmm. Got a bunch of the baseball ones. My favorite.

593
00:30:21,350 --> 00:30:23,770
有我在  你可以高枕無憂了
You know I got you covered.

594
00:30:23,853 --> 00:30:25,939
-辛迪  -怎么
- Cindy. - Yo.

595
00:30:26,022 --> 00:30:27,482
有什么要給我的嗎
Got something for me?

596
00:30:27,566 --> 00:30:29,943
事實是  沒有
Oh. So, here's the thing. No.

597
00:30:31,403 --> 00:30:32,696
也許你愿意來解釋一下
Maybe you'd care to explain.

598
00:30:32,779 --> 00:30:34,197
不是每個人都有券
Not everyone had stamps.

599
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:35,990
她們不知道你會找她們要券
They didn't know you was gonna be looking for 'em.

600
00:30:36,074 --> 00:30:37,742
但不代表就不該給她們煙抽
Doesn't mean they shouldn't get a smoke.

601
00:30:37,826 --> 00:30:40,662
其實  就是那個意思
Well, actually, that's exactly what it means.

602
00:30:40,745 --> 00:30:42,914
這就叫生意
It's called commerce.

603
00:30:42,997 --> 00:30:44,791
我讓她們按老辦法交易
I let 'em trade for it old school,

604
00:30:44,792 --> 00:30:46,585
就像印第安人那樣
like the red man.

605
00:30:49,963 --> 00:30:53,007
賤人  相信我  你該給維的必須給
Bitch, trust me, you do not wanna short Vee.

606
00:30:53,091 --> 00:30:55,134
她會化身金剛狼揍你
She will go Wolverine on your ass.

607
00:30:55,218 --> 00:30:57,011
好吧  聽著
All right, listen.

608
00:30:57,095 --> 00:30:58,930
后面的煙我會多賣幾塊錢
I'll sell the next ones for a couple bucks extra,

609
00:30:59,013 --> 00:31:00,181
好補差價
make up the difference.

610
00:31:01,224 --> 00:31:03,560
如果你整包賣不好  你就別賣了
If you can't be trusted with the package, you can't be selling.

611
00:31:03,643 --> 00:31:04,978
從現在起  你去做維護
From now on, you're on maintenance.

612
00:31:05,061 --> 00:31:06,270
那是什么意思
What that supposed to mean?

613
00:31:06,354 --> 00:31:07,564
就是你去干蘇珊娜干的活
You do what Suzanne's been doing.

614
00:31:07,647 --> 00:31:09,566
你給賣煙的人卷煙
You roll smokes for everyone to sell,

615
00:31:09,567 --> 00:31:11,485
打包  收尾
package them, sweep up behind.

616
00:31:11,568 --> 00:31:13,152
我不要干苦差事
I ain't doing no grunt work.

617
00:31:13,236 --> 00:31:14,221
等你還清了債
When you've paid off your debt,

618
00:31:14,222 --> 00:31:15,864
會給你機會賣煙的
you'll get another chance at sales.

619
00:31:15,947 --> 00:31:16,990
去他媽的
Fuck that.

620
00:31:27,416 --> 00:31:28,460
你頂替她
Take her place.

621
00:31:29,586 --> 00:31:30,670
如果你想干的話
If you wanted to.

622
00:31:34,841 --> 00:31:36,092
好的  我會考慮看看的
Yeah, I'll think about it.

623
00:31:40,805 --> 00:31:42,140
我不怕你
I ain't scared of you.

624
00:31:55,987 --> 00:31:57,781
說吧  莫妮  說吧
Say it, Moni! Say it, Mo...

625
00:32:03,411 --> 00:32:06,330
-學校里怎么樣  -還好
- Hey, so, how you doin' in school? - Okay.

626
00:32:06,414 --> 00:32:09,501
-你喜歡其他孩子嗎  -他們還行
- You like them other kids? - They're okay.

627
00:32:09,584 --> 00:32:12,921
有些人取笑我  說我是呆子
Some of them make fun of me. Say I'm a nerd.

628
00:32:13,004 --> 00:32:15,214
還說我沒有手機
And I don't got a cell phone.

629
00:32:15,298 --> 00:32:17,967
說我的名字照《老友記》里的控制狂取的
Say I must've got named after that tense girl on Friends.

630
00:32:18,051 --> 00:32:19,260
凈是些胡說八道
Man, that's some bullshit.

631
00:32:19,343 --> 00:32:20,260
你的名字是照著
You was named after

632
00:32:20,261 --> 00:32:22,096
《愛情與籃球》里的莫妮卡取的
Monica from Love & Basketball,

633
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:23,932
是桑娜·萊瑟扮演的
played by Miss Sanaa Lathan,

634
00:32:24,015 --> 00:32:27,727
她才不是假正經  她跟丹澤爾搞上了呢
who, by the way, is so un-uptight she hooked it up with Denzel.

635
00:32:27,811 --> 00:32:29,521
他都已經結婚了
And he married!

636
00:32:29,604 --> 00:32:30,939
媽媽說那是謠言
Ma says that's a rumor.

637
00:32:31,022 --> 00:32:33,900
不是謠言  而且媽媽很無聊
It ain't no rumor. And Ma is boring anyway.

638
00:32:33,983 --> 00:32:36,810
靠  那是我伙計馬丁嗎
Shit. Yo! Is that my boy Martin?

639
00:32:36,811 --> 00:32:39,072
我以為他還在監獄里呢
I thought his ass in jail.

640
00:32:39,155 --> 00:32:40,364
他上個月出獄的
He got out last month.

641
00:32:40,448 --> 00:32:41,866
看看這個
Watch this.

642
00:32:43,952 --> 00:32:46,454
沒門  我再打給你
No way. I'll hit you back.

643
00:32:46,538 --> 00:32:47,649
你在這里干嘛  老兄
What you doing here, dawg?

644
00:32:47,650 --> 00:32:48,873
我以為你在監獄里呢
I thought your ass was in jail.

645
00:32:48,957 --> 00:32:51,292
拜托  我沒那么蠢
Oh, please. I'm too slick for that shit.

646
00:32:51,375 --> 00:32:52,418
你好
Hi.

647
00:32:52,501 --> 00:32:55,463
我在匹茲堡找了一份政府工作
I got a government job out at Pittsburgh.

648
00:32:55,547 --> 00:32:57,006
你瘋了
This is crazy.

649
00:32:57,090 --> 00:32:58,800
你一定要上樓來跟福滋打個招呼
Hey, you gotta come upstairs and say hey to Fozzie.

650
00:32:58,883 --> 00:33:00,426
靠  福滋也在
Shit. Fozzie around, too?

651
00:33:00,509 --> 00:33:02,804
他看到你的話肯定會尿褲子的
He's gonna wet himself when he sees you.

652
00:33:02,887 --> 00:33:04,472
我要上樓十分鐘
Look, I'm gonna go upstairs for, like, 10 minutes.

653
00:33:04,556 --> 00:33:06,766
你就待在這里  好嗎
You stay right here, all right?

654
00:33:06,850 --> 00:33:09,811
等等
Hey, hey. Oh, hold up.

655
00:33:09,894 --> 00:33:11,771
最多二十分鐘  我保證
Twenty minutes, tops. I promise.

656
00:33:13,314 --> 00:33:14,983
愛你
Love you.

657
00:33:15,066 --> 00:33:18,152
孩子  來抱個  不  好好抱個
Yo! Son, give me some. No, bring that shit in.

658
00:33:18,236 --> 00:33:20,321
來吧  伙計
Come on, man!

659
00:33:20,404 --> 00:33:24,033
你最后拿那些電燈泡怎么辦了
Hey, so what'd you end up doing with all them light bulbs?

660
00:33:26,035 --> 00:33:30,248
你殺了我  啦啦啦
You slay me, dee, dee, dee.

661
00:33:34,586 --> 00:33:36,254
旺達
Hey, Wanda.

662
00:33:42,761 --> 00:33:44,012
我
I, um... 

663
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:48,266
我想說對不起
I wanted to say I'm sorry.

664
00:33:48,349 --> 00:33:50,518
有點太遲了
It's a little late for that.

665
00:33:52,270 --> 00:33:55,189
是我搞砸了  事情進展得太快
I screwed up. Things were just moving so fast that... 

666
00:33:55,273 --> 00:33:57,035
我不小了  斯科特
I'm of an age, Scott.

667
00:33:57,036 --> 00:33:58,652
你別占著茅坑不拉屎
You gotta shit or get off the pot.

668
00:34:02,989 --> 00:34:05,033
再給我一次機會
Give me another chance.

669
00:34:06,450 --> 00:34:08,077
我會搬進來的
I'll move in.

670
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:11,998
我會把榨汁機什么的都帶過來
I'll bring the Vitamix and everything.

671
00:34:13,582 --> 00:34:14,709
我想念你
I miss you.

672
00:34:21,633 --> 00:34:23,217
過來  親愛的
Come here, panda.

673
00:34:31,643 --> 00:34:33,561
我也想念你
I missed you, too.

674
00:34:37,148 --> 00:34:39,108
我研究了下女體解剖學
I've learned some things about the female anatomy

675
00:34:39,192 --> 00:34:40,359
我想你會喜歡的
I think you might enjoy.

676
00:34:51,079 --> 00:34:52,747
你對我朋友瑪麗薩做了什么
What the fuck did you do to my girl Maritza?

677
00:34:52,831 --> 00:34:53,957
她們敲詐我
They were blackmailing me.

678
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:55,374
她什么都不會說的
She wasn't gonna say nothing.

679
00:34:55,458 --> 00:34:57,085
你覺得她會讓我孩子他爸坐牢
You think she's trying to get my baby daddy locked up

680
00:34:57,168 --> 00:34:58,211
讓他無法撫養孩子嗎
so he can't provide?

681
00:34:58,294 --> 00:34:59,587
我不能冒這樣的險
That's not a risk I can take.

682
00:34:59,671 --> 00:35:01,255
那是我監獄里的妹妹
That is my sister in here.

683
00:35:01,339 --> 00:35:03,591
我一點都不喜歡那個賤人  可她是我家人
I don't even like the bitch. But she's family.

684
00:35:03,675 --> 00:35:05,593
我應該怎么做  告訴我
What am I supposed to do? Tell me.

685
00:35:05,677 --> 00:35:07,531
難道要讓這里的每個西班牙姑娘
Am I supposed to let every Spanish girl around here

686
00:35:07,532 --> 00:35:08,304
都來欺負我
start pushing me around?

687
00:35:08,387 --> 00:35:09,723
-上帝啊  -我是獄警
- Oh, good God. - I'm a CO.

688
00:35:09,806 --> 00:35:10,851
你覺得要是他們看到
What do you think happens

689
00:35:10,851 --> 00:35:13,650
我給犯人帶小瓶裝的酒會發生什么事
when they see me giving an inmate airplane bottles of Jaeger?

690
00:35:13,852 --> 00:35:14,919
你不肯戴套的時候
Maybe you should've thought of it

691
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:16,520
怎么不想到這一點
when you didn't wanna wear a condom. Huh?

692
00:35:16,604 --> 00:35:17,245
寶貝  我要出來了
"I'm gonna pull out, baby.

693
00:35:17,245 --> 00:35:19,941
戴套子很難高潮
It takes so long to come with a rubber."

694
00:35:20,024 --> 00:35:21,234
你明明知道  這不公平
That's not fair, and you know it.

695
00:35:21,317 --> 00:35:22,943
滾蛋  我罵臟話了
Fuck you. I just used obscenity.

696
00:35:22,944 --> 00:35:24,028
你要給我記過嗎
You gonna write me a shot?

697
00:35:24,112 --> 00:35:28,116
-達婭  我  -襲警  記我一筆呀
- Daya, I'm... - Assaulting an officer. Write me a shot.

698
00:35:28,199 --> 00:35:30,702
怎么  沒種的家伙  來呀
What, pussy? Come on. Huh?

699
00:35:30,785 --> 00:35:32,620
我不會給你記過的
I'm not writing you a shot.

700
00:35:32,704 --> 00:35:35,999
可是只要你想你就能記一筆  對嗎
But you could if you wanted to, right?

701
00:35:36,082 --> 00:35:39,502
因為你可以選擇  你有這個權力
Because you have a choice. You have the power.

702
00:35:40,544 --> 00:35:41,629
而我是個犯人
I'm an inmate.

703
00:35:42,839 --> 00:35:44,382
我一無所有
I have nothing.

704
00:35:50,388 --> 00:35:53,057
上帝啊  我討厭老年人
Jesus, I hate the elderly.

705
00:35:53,141 --> 00:35:55,727
女士們先生們  有請下一位州參議員
Ladies and gentlemen, your next state senator.

706
00:35:56,853 --> 00:35:58,646
你想要討論基礎設施
You wanna talk infrastructure

707
00:35:58,730 --> 00:36:02,817
或者洪水水位之類的  真遺憾
or flood levels or whatever, too bad.

708
00:36:02,901 --> 00:36:06,112
每次都是相同的問題
It's the same goddamn question every time.

709
00:36:06,195 --> 00:36:07,443
不  安迪·魯尼
No, Andy Rooney,

710
00:36:07,444 --> 00:36:09,783
我不會談你那操蛋的醫保制度
I am not gonna touch your fucking Medicare.

711
00:36:09,866 --> 00:36:12,201
你說該說的  老頭兒會投票的
Say what you got to say. The geezers vote.

712
00:36:15,538 --> 00:36:17,123
你覺得我的頭發看起來太閃了嗎
Do you think my hair looks too shiny?

713
00:36:20,835 --> 00:36:22,837
《都市郵報》報道說
Hey, so, City Post is reporting

714
00:36:22,837 --> 00:36:25,580
羅利的PAC得到了  叫什么來著
Rowley's PAC just got a major donation from,

715
00:36:22,921 --> 00:36:26,465
{\an8}political action committee 政治行動委員會


716
00:36:25,580 --> 00:36:29,427
高爾夫球場那家伙的大筆捐款
what's-his-face, the golf-course guy.

717
00:36:29,510 --> 00:36:32,221
他們估計有150萬美元
They put it at a million and a half.

718
00:36:33,222 --> 00:36:34,974
我靠
Oh, fuck.

719
00:36:35,058 --> 00:36:37,670
我敢打賭羅利肯定手舞足蹈得像只淫猴
I bet Rowley danced like a little monkey-whore for it, too,

720
00:36:37,671 --> 00:36:38,770
那個賤人
that dick stain.

721
00:36:38,853 --> 00:36:41,272
完了  我們死定了
That's it, then. We're fucked.

722
00:36:43,232 --> 00:36:45,318
你可以走了  加文
You can take off, Gavin.

723
00:36:45,401 --> 00:36:46,527
好的
Cool.

724
00:36:48,112 --> 00:36:49,447
今天的演講很棒  先生
Great speech today, sir.

725
00:36:52,033 --> 00:36:53,993
非常有感染力
It was very powerful.

726
00:37:00,208 --> 00:37:03,294
聽著  我們不會放棄的
Listen, we're not giving up.

727
00:37:03,377 --> 00:37:05,171
我們會想出解決的辦法  我們還有選擇
We'll figure this out. We've got options.

728
00:37:05,254 --> 00:37:06,380
我很有壓力  寶貝
I am stressed, babe.

729
00:37:06,464 --> 00:37:08,269
有個記者在死死追問利奇菲爾德的事
I have this reporter buzzing around Litchfield

730
00:37:08,464 --> 00:37:09,968
{\an8}《奧巴馬的戰爭》作者


731
00:37:08,270 --> 00:37:09,968
他就像該死的鮑勃·伍德沃德
like a Bob fucking Woodward.

732
00:37:10,051 --> 00:37:11,427
他什么都不會發現的  我保證
He's not gonna find anything. I promise.

733
00:37:11,510 --> 00:37:13,012
聽他意思就是  "當然  老兄
It's like, "Sure, buddy.

734
00:37:13,096 --> 00:37:16,307
我們還是操心下給女囚建豪華浴室的事吧
Let's worry about funding luxury bathrooms for these ladies,

735
00:37:16,390 --> 00:37:18,184
雙淋浴噴頭  各種各種
dual-action shower heads, the works.

736
00:37:18,267 --> 00:37:19,854
別去解決什么判決法的問題
Don't bother fixing the sentencing laws,

737
00:37:19,937 --> 00:37:22,373
讓每個人都得到公平審判
guaranteeing a fair trial for everyone

738
00:37:22,374 --> 00:37:23,940
和稱職的律師
and a competent lawyer."

739
00:37:24,023 --> 00:37:25,524
不  不  給她們浴球就行了"
"No, no. Let's give 'em loofahs."

740
00:37:25,608 --> 00:37:26,734
我知道  我知道
Yeah, I know. I know.

741
00:37:26,818 --> 00:37:29,821
人有時候真目光短淺
People can be so small.

742
00:37:29,904 --> 00:37:31,906
我們會贏的  我保證
We're gonna win. I promise.

743
00:37:33,074 --> 00:37:37,495
然后我們可以來解決真正重要的問題
And then we can get to work fixing what's really important.

744
00:37:37,578 --> 00:37:40,289
我們是好人  我們會拉到資金的
We're the good guys. We'll find the money.

745
00:37:41,499 --> 00:37:43,376
我們會在奧爾巴尼買棟房子
We'll get a house in Albany.

746
00:37:43,377 --> 00:37:45,253
也許終于有個孩子
Maybe finally have a kid.

747
00:37:45,336 --> 00:37:45,837
如果你想要孩子
If you wanna have a kid,

748
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:49,007
你就得跟我上床
you might actually have to have sex with me.

749
00:37:57,056 --> 00:37:59,100
你知道  我
You know, I'm... 

750
00:38:00,226 --> 00:38:03,229
我總是精疲力盡  這件事讓我心力交瘁
I'm exhausted all the time. This is so draining.

751
00:38:03,312 --> 00:38:05,523
我知道  我很抱歉  我只是
I know. I'm sorry. I just... 

752
00:38:08,026 --> 00:38:10,569
我只是想感受到你想要我
I just wanna feel like you want me.

753
00:38:13,489 --> 00:38:15,658
我不僅想要你  寶貝
I more than want you, babe.

754
00:38:16,993 --> 00:38:18,744
我需要你
I need you.

755
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:43,727
你好  哥們
G'day, mate!

756
00:38:43,811 --> 00:38:47,648
我開玩笑的  誰會那樣說呢
I'm just kidding. Who even says that?

757
00:38:47,731 --> 00:38:49,817
我得離家一會兒
I had to get out of the house for a bit.

758
00:38:49,901 --> 00:38:54,197
波麗今天很讓人厭煩
Polly has been a pill today.

759
00:38:55,239 --> 00:38:57,450
我整個下午都在看孩子
I watched the baby all afternoon.

760
00:38:57,533 --> 00:39:01,162
我跟她說出去兜兜風  隨便她做什么
I told her to go spin or whatever it is that she does.

761
00:39:01,245 --> 00:39:02,746
結果等她回來
And then when she gets back,

762
00:39:02,747 --> 00:39:05,749
她的情緒比之前更古怪
she's in an even weirder mood than before.

763
00:39:07,043 --> 00:39:09,337
女人啊  是不是
Bitches. Am I right?

764
00:39:11,047 --> 00:39:12,590
你怎么了  哥們
So what's up with you, mate?

765
00:39:23,226 --> 00:39:25,228
我不敢進去
I'm afraid to get in.

766
00:39:26,479 --> 00:39:29,523
這水真冷
The water is so cold.

767
00:39:31,567 --> 00:39:34,445
你總是能說服我
You always talk me into things.

768
00:39:36,114 --> 00:39:37,281
好吧
All right.

769
00:39:38,491 --> 00:39:40,159
見鬼去吧
The hell with it.

770
00:39:41,369 --> 00:39:43,537
我來啦
Here I come!

771
00:40:25,079 --> 00:40:26,455
從樹上下去
Get out the tree!

772
00:40:29,667 --> 00:40:31,919
我一般不碰樹的
I don't mess with trees, generally.

773
00:40:33,087 --> 00:40:36,424
你為什么要偷偷摸摸鬼鬼祟祟的
Why are you sneaking around all stealth and shit?

774
00:40:36,507 --> 00:40:38,092
你他媽又不是粉紅豹
You ain't the damn Pink Panther.

775
00:40:40,011 --> 00:40:43,889
你真有趣  總是開開玩笑  插科打諢
You're funny, aren't you? Always joking, always clownin'.

776
00:40:45,849 --> 00:40:47,726
這里還不能笑  那我們還能干嘛
We can't laugh in here, what else we got?

777
00:40:47,810 --> 00:40:50,021
說得不錯
That's a fair point.

778
00:40:50,104 --> 00:40:53,732
問題是如果你只會開玩笑
Problem is when jokes are all you've got.

779
00:40:55,484 --> 00:40:58,116
你就像故事里的蟋蟀
You're like the grasshopper in the story.

780
00:40:58,117 --> 00:41:01,407
活在當下  今朝有酒今朝醉的人
Living for today, having a fine time.

781
00:41:01,490 --> 00:41:04,910
沒有責任  沒有計劃  沒有抱負
No responsibilities, no plans, no ambition.

782
00:41:04,993 --> 00:41:06,829
及時行樂  對吧
Carpe diem, right?

783
00:41:09,165 --> 00:41:12,126
比你聰明的人早就說過了
Somebody even smarter than you said that.

784
00:41:12,210 --> 00:41:14,045
當年這句話或許還有些道理
Yeah, well, that probably worked back then

785
00:41:14,128 --> 00:41:17,465
那時的人四十歲前還可能出去
when folks were expected to check out before 40.

786
00:41:19,383 --> 00:41:22,428
如果你不努力創造未來
Thing is, if you're not building a future,

787
00:41:23,471 --> 00:41:26,557
那是因為你不相信未來的存在
that's because you don't believe there is a future.

788
00:41:27,725 --> 00:41:30,519
是你自暴自棄
You've given up on yourself.

789
00:41:33,314 --> 00:41:35,066
你就是個廢物
You're a loser.

790
00:41:48,912 --> 00:41:50,581
你瘋了嗎
Are you out of your mind?

791
00:41:50,664 --> 00:41:54,168
我一直等你到半夜  都不知道你在哪里
I'm up waiting till midnight for you, no idea where you are.

792
00:41:54,252 --> 00:41:56,087
一切都很好  我們只是晚回來了
Everything's cool. We got held up, is all.

793
00:41:56,170 --> 00:42:00,508
這孩子才九歲  她衣服上居然有大麻味
The girl is nine years old. Her clothes reek of pot smoke.

794
00:42:02,260 --> 00:42:04,762
她沒抽  我又不是神經病
She ain't smoke none. I ain't no psycho.

795
00:42:04,845 --> 00:42:08,974
讓你帶她出門是我的錯
This is my fault for letting you take her.

796
00:42:09,057 --> 00:42:12,478
你就是嫉妒她喜歡我比喜歡你多  承認吧
You just jealous 'cause she like me more than you. Admit it.

797
00:42:12,561 --> 00:42:14,647
別給你自己臉上貼金
Don't you flatter yourself.

798
00:42:14,730 --> 00:42:15,475
不管是誰
She would like anyone

799
00:42:15,476 --> 00:42:17,900
難得出現  還送她禮物
who showed up here every once in a blue moon

800
00:42:17,983 --> 00:42:21,112
她都會喜歡的  哪怕禮物來路不明
and gave her presents they didn't even come by honest.

801
00:42:22,113 --> 00:42:24,823
該死的她是我女兒  我想做什么就做什么
I can do whatever I want with my own damn daughter!

802
00:42:31,455 --> 00:42:34,625
你把她留在我這里的時候
You lost all right to call her your daughter

803
00:42:34,708 --> 00:42:36,544
就再也沒資格當她媽媽了
when you left her here with me!

804
00:42:36,627 --> 00:42:39,630
你覺得我沒資格  要不這樣
You think I lost my right? How about this?

805
00:42:41,257 --> 00:42:44,385
要不我們告訴她真相  看看她會選誰
Why don't we tell her the truth and see who she choose?

806
00:42:44,468 --> 00:42:46,762
你不許那么做
Don't you dare do that to her.

807
00:42:46,845 --> 00:42:48,139
她現在夠大了
She old enough now.

808
00:42:48,222 --> 00:42:49,757
你什么都不許跟她說
You ain't tellin' her nothin'

809
00:42:49,758 --> 00:42:51,975
你就會自己走掉把她扔下
and then walk out and leave her.

810
00:42:52,059 --> 00:42:55,438
你要告訴她  好啊  你去告訴她呀
You wanna tell her? Fine. You go on and tell her.

811
00:42:55,521 --> 00:42:57,398
不過你要告訴她就得帶她走
But then you got to take her.

812
00:42:57,481 --> 00:42:58,482
也許我會這么做的
Well, maybe I will.

813
00:42:58,566 --> 00:43:01,527
你能給這孩子提供什么樣的照顧
And what kind of care are you gonna provide for that child?

814
00:43:01,610 --> 00:43:04,238
你會每天去學校接她
You gonna pick her up every day from school,

815
00:43:04,322 --> 00:43:06,240
帶她去上鋼琴課嗎
take her to her piano class?

816
00:43:06,324 --> 00:43:08,075
你能給她編辮子嗎
You gonna braid her hair,

817
00:43:08,159 --> 00:43:10,244
她生病的時候你能通宵陪她嗎
sit up at nights when she's sick,

818
00:43:10,328 --> 00:43:11,745
她吐的時候你能跪下來給她清理干凈嗎
clean up her vomit down on your hands and knees?

819
00:43:11,829 --> 00:43:13,247
怎么  你覺得我辦不到
What, you don't think I can do that shit?

820
00:43:13,331 --> 00:43:14,415
那你帶她走呀
You take her, then.

821
00:43:14,498 --> 00:43:17,790
如果你覺得撫養她你能做得比我好
If you think you can do a better job of raising her than me,

822
00:43:17,791 --> 00:43:18,669
請便
be my guest.

823
00:43:18,752 --> 00:43:20,921
帶她走  走呀
Take her. Go!

824
00:43:24,925 --> 00:43:26,344
我怎么會知道呢
How should I know,

825
00:43:26,427 --> 00:43:28,053
她什么都不告訴我
she doesn't tell me anything.

826
00:43:28,679 --> 00:43:31,515
她整天畫些奇怪的畫
Spends all her time drawing her weird pictures.

827
00:43:33,434 --> 00:43:35,143
你有花
You have a plant.

828
00:43:35,228 --> 00:43:37,104
對  放溫室里
Yeah. For the greenhouse.

829
00:43:38,314 --> 00:43:40,983
這是我家灌木叢里開出的迷迭香
It's rosemary from my bush at home.

830
00:43:41,066 --> 00:43:42,651
是一個全新的品種
Grows into a whole new plant.

831
00:43:45,821 --> 00:43:46,822
不管怎樣
Anyway,

832
00:43:48,324 --> 00:43:50,075
很抱歉我昨天不得不采取嚴厲手段
sorry I had to crack the whip yesterday.

833
00:43:50,158 --> 00:43:51,869
沒關系  就是
No, it's... It was... 

834
00:43:51,952 --> 00:43:55,623
這工作看起來也許很簡單  但并非如此
This job may look easy, but it isn't.

835
00:43:57,208 --> 00:44:00,794
我有抱負  有一天我會成為典獄長的
I got ambition, you know? I could be warden one day.

836
00:44:00,878 --> 00:44:03,297
記過配額指標能不能成功  誰知道呢
This whole shot-quota thing, who knows if it works?

837
00:44:03,381 --> 00:44:04,910
管理層的人都喜歡有計劃
The people upstairs, they like plans.

838
00:44:04,911 --> 00:44:06,300
他們喜歡積極主動
They like initiative.

839
00:44:06,384 --> 00:44:08,802
你得向他們展示你很有手段
You got to show 'em you're operating.

840
00:44:08,886 --> 00:44:10,095
我明白
I understand.

841
00:44:11,389 --> 00:44:14,642
有些人一點抱負也沒有
Some people, they got no ambition at all.

842
00:44:14,725 --> 00:44:18,201
他們就想得過且過  吃吃喝喝
They just wanna skate by, drink beer,

843
00:44:18,202 --> 00:44:20,188
干得越少越好
do as little as possible.

844
00:44:22,316 --> 00:44:24,902
比如盧斯奇
Luschek, for instance.

845
00:44:26,279 --> 00:44:28,155
盧斯奇人很好
Luschek's nice.

846
00:44:28,239 --> 00:44:31,659
當然  如果你喜歡那樣的話
Sure. If you like that kind of thing.

847
00:44:31,742 --> 00:44:33,744
我喜歡跟他聊天
I like talking to him.

848
00:44:33,827 --> 00:44:36,086
跟懂你每天在做什么的人聊天
It's nice chatting with someone

849
00:44:36,087 --> 00:44:36,955
是很開心的
who gets what you do all day, you know?

850
00:44:37,039 --> 00:44:38,832
比如工作的事
Like, work stuff.

851
00:44:44,297 --> 00:44:45,339
好吧
Okay.

852
00:44:46,382 --> 00:44:47,841
我把這個拿出去
I'm gonna bring this outside.

853
00:44:47,925 --> 00:44:48,926
明天見
See you tomorrow.

854
00:44:54,765 --> 00:44:56,684
她還是你的女兒  阿蕾達
She's still your daughter, Aleida.

855
00:44:56,767 --> 00:44:59,186
記住你懷孕時的樣子
Remember how you were when you were pregnant.

856
00:45:00,438 --> 00:45:03,273
我懷孕的時候  我跟我媽談過
When I was pregnant, I talked to my mother.

857
00:45:05,568 --> 00:45:07,152
你確定要用這種字體
Yo, are you sure about this font?

858
00:45:07,235 --> 00:45:08,654
真的嗎
Yo, yo, really?

859
00:45:08,737 --> 00:45:11,865
本尼特不會提交瑪麗薩的材料的
Look, Bennett ain't gonna file the paperwork for Maritza.

860
00:45:11,949 --> 00:45:12,999
他只是想給她個教訓
He was just trying to teach her a lesson.

861
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:14,284
她明天就會放出來的
She'll be out tomorrow.

862
00:45:14,368 --> 00:45:15,869
我根本沒提瑪麗薩的事
I didn't say anything about Maritza.

863
00:45:15,953 --> 00:45:17,371
可是你表現得很緊張
But you're acting like an uptight bitch.

864
00:45:17,455 --> 00:45:19,271
只是因為你畫漫畫
Well, just because you're doing a comic

865
00:45:19,272 --> 00:45:21,542
不代表你就要用漫畫體
doesn't mean you have to use Comic Sans.

866
00:45:21,625 --> 00:45:24,044
什么  小心眼
What... Hater.

867
00:45:24,127 --> 00:45:24,906
我從沒想到
I never would've thought

868
00:45:24,906 --> 00:45:27,340
速溶咖啡可以用來畫眼影
instant coffee could be used for eye shadow.

869
00:45:27,423 --> 00:45:29,546
是啊  寶貝  它味道不好
Oh, yeah, hon. I mean, it tastes like ass,

870
00:45:29,547 --> 00:45:31,344
所以不如用作化妝品
so it's actually better as a cosmetic.

871
00:45:31,427 --> 00:45:33,887
誰會想到卡普托養了只烏龜
Who would have thought that Caputo had a turtle?

872
00:45:33,971 --> 00:45:36,515
我還以為他喜歡養鳥呢
I mean, I had him pegged as a bird guy.

873
00:45:36,599 --> 00:45:38,559
女主編  干得怎么樣了
Madam Editor, how you doing?

874
00:45:38,642 --> 00:45:40,644
我們其實都是副主編
We're actually all assistant editors here.

875
00:45:40,728 --> 00:45:42,028
就像電視節目里
Oh, you mean like a TV show

876
00:45:42,029 --> 00:45:44,815
所有名字都會在最前面滾動播放嗎
with all those names rolling by up front?

877
00:45:44,898 --> 00:45:46,066
他們不可能都那么重要
They can't all be that important.

878
00:45:46,149 --> 00:45:49,987
我向你保證每個人都是不可或缺的
I assure you that everyone here is vital to the operation.

879
00:45:50,070 --> 00:45:51,238
好吧
Oh, okay.

880
00:45:51,321 --> 00:45:53,240
看看這個  海利先生
Check this out, Mr. Healy.

881
00:45:53,323 --> 00:45:55,075
這是什么
What's this?

882
00:45:55,158 --> 00:45:56,535
漫畫
Comics.

883
00:45:58,746 --> 00:46:00,330
很好的作品
Hey, good artwork.

884
00:46:00,414 --> 00:46:01,499
海利先生
Hey, Mr. Healy,

885
00:46:01,582 --> 00:46:03,584
不知道你有沒有聽說我準假申請的事
I was wondering if you've heard anything about my furlough.

886
00:46:03,667 --> 00:46:06,545
你知道官僚作風  我會打電話問問的
Hey, bureaucracy, you know? I'll call around and check.

887
00:46:06,629 --> 00:46:08,005
這是什么時候的事
Hey, when did this happen?

888
00:46:08,088 --> 00:46:11,425
就是讓他不要纏著我們
That's just to keep him off our backs, you know.

889
00:46:11,509 --> 00:46:12,760
自負
Ego.

890
00:46:12,843 --> 00:46:14,637
聰明  查普曼
Good thinking, Chapman.

891
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:16,805
好吧  繼續干吧
All right, carry on.

892
00:46:16,889 --> 00:46:18,724
那只海象真滑稽
That walrus is hilarious.

893
00:46:22,395 --> 00:46:23,437
把我畫的給我
Give me my shit.

894
00:46:36,492 --> 00:46:38,326
拿那個的地方還有很多
There's more where that came from.

895
00:46:38,411 --> 00:46:40,037
我知道
I know.

896
00:46:40,120 --> 00:46:42,998
因為酸奶就是我做起來的
Because I invented the yogurt thing.

897
00:46:43,081 --> 00:46:45,626
有點創意行嗎  曼多薩
Have some originality, Mendoza, huh?

898
00:46:47,628 --> 00:46:50,380
好吧  我沒想到會是這樣的
Okay, I didn't ask for any of this.

899
00:46:53,300 --> 00:46:56,929
有等候名單  不過我會想辦法的
There's a waiting list, but I'll see what I can do.

900
00:46:57,012 --> 00:47:00,474
你想要什么  泥漿面膜
What do you want? A nice mud mask?

901
00:47:01,642 --> 00:47:02,768
還是口香糖
Or is it gum?

902
00:47:02,851 --> 00:47:05,979
由于某種原因突然間每個人都想要口香糖
Everyone suddenly seems to want gum for some reason.

903
00:47:06,063 --> 00:47:08,190
她們是要用包裝材料來做打火機
They're making lighters with the wrappers.

904
00:47:09,567 --> 00:47:12,152
我一點都不喜歡這樣
I don't like this one bit.

905
00:47:12,235 --> 00:47:14,655
拜托  她賣她的  你賣你的
Please. She sells her thing, you sell yours.

906
00:47:14,738 --> 00:47:15,989
井水不犯河水
It's no competition.

907
00:47:18,408 --> 00:47:19,785
所以你站在她那邊
So you're on her side?

908
00:47:19,868 --> 00:47:23,205
不不  我不要黑市上的東西
No, no, no, no. I don't want no black-market shit.

909
00:47:24,372 --> 00:47:27,918
我要香菜  你可以在花園種
I want cilantro. You can grow that in the garden.

910
00:47:30,754 --> 00:47:31,755
成交
Deal.

911
00:47:33,716 --> 00:47:36,093
-再種點辣椒  -別得寸進尺
- Some padron peppers? - Don't push it.

912
00:47:36,176 --> 00:47:37,260
不過好吧
But fine.

913
00:47:38,846 --> 00:47:40,430
那好
Fine then.

914
00:47:44,309 --> 00:47:46,144
我要遲到了
I'm late for somethin'.

915
00:48:03,693 --> 00:48:06,029
{\an8}《獄中號角》


916
00:48:34,693 --> 00:48:37,029
你總是把眼前的棋子都吃掉
You keep taking out all the targets in front of you,

917
00:48:37,112 --> 00:48:39,865
可是你得想三步  蘇珊娜
but you've got to think ahead, Suzanne.

918
00:48:39,948 --> 00:48:41,909
如果你走那里
If you move there,

919
00:48:44,662 --> 00:48:45,704
我會怎么走呢
what'll I do?

920
00:48:48,290 --> 00:48:50,333
這就叫放長線釣大魚
It's called the long game.

921
00:48:54,171 --> 00:48:55,714
好吧
Okay.

922
00:48:55,798 --> 00:48:57,090
好什么
Okay, what?

923
00:48:59,635 --> 00:49:01,929
那差事我干
I'll take my medicine.

924
00:49:04,056 --> 00:49:05,098
給她袋子
Give her the bag.

925
00:49:14,107 --> 00:49:15,609
這是什么
What's this?

926
00:49:15,693 --> 00:49:16,777
用過的衛生棉條
Used tampons.

927
00:49:18,486 --> 00:49:19,875
不是衛生棉條
Not the tampons.

928
00:49:19,876 --> 00:49:23,116
只是套管  垃圾桶里撿的
Just the tube-y parts. From the trash can.

929
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:24,952
你這是在整我吧
Now you just fuckin' with me.

930
00:49:25,035 --> 00:49:27,788
衛生棉條在小賣部賣五美元
Tampons cost $5 at the commissary.

931
00:49:27,871 --> 00:49:30,040
垃圾桶里用過的套管  免費
Used applicators out of the trash, they're free.

932
00:49:30,123 --> 00:49:31,709
你以為第一批貨是怎么來的
Where do you think the first batch came from?

933
00:49:33,251 --> 00:49:34,419
總有人得做
Somebody had to do it.

934
00:49:34,502 --> 00:49:36,004
真惡心
This is disgusting.

935
00:49:36,088 --> 00:49:37,380
的確如此
Yes, it is.

936
00:49:43,220 --> 00:49:44,638
這可好
Great.

937
00:49:57,735 --> 00:49:59,277
我口渴
I'm thirsty.

938
00:49:59,361 --> 00:50:00,455
喝我給你的水
Drink the water I gave you.

939
00:50:00,456 --> 00:50:02,489
我不要水  我要果汁
I don't want water. I want juice.

940
00:50:02,572 --> 00:50:04,658
你得等我們過了安檢再說

你有孩子嗎

沒有

謝謝  我們走  寶貝

945
00:50:30,058 --> 00:50:34,855
我不要去  我不要去  我不要去
I'm not going. I'm not going. I'm not going.

946
00:50:34,938 --> 00:50:38,441
羅伯塔  別讓他們帶走我  羅伯塔
Roberta! Don't let them take me! Roberta!

947
00:50:39,943 --> 00:50:43,947
羅伯塔  不要去  不要去
Roberta. Not going. Not going.

948
00:50:45,032 --> 00:50:47,075
告訴我他們帶走她是為了幫她
Please tell me that they're taking her to get help.

949
00:50:47,159 --> 00:50:49,244
他們帶她去公交站
They're taking her to the bus station.

950

{\an8}第36任美國總統

954
00:50:57,795 --> 00:50:58,962
他們不會給她付錢的

955
00:50:59,046 --> 00:51:00,213
她的家人呢
What about her family?

00:51:00,297 --> 00:51:03,025
她有個女兒在斯德哥爾摩

957
00:51:03,026 --> 00:51:05,010
可她們沒聯系
They don't speak.

958
00:51:05,093 --> 00:51:06,679
那她就無家可歸了
So she's out on the street?

959
00:51:08,555 --> 00:51:12,267
這叫"以人道理由獲釋"
It's called "compassionate release".

960
00:51:12,350 --> 00:51:15,103
羅伯塔

00:51:16,980 --> 00:51:18,481
羅伯塔
