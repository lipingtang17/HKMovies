1
00:01:14,465 --> 00:01:19,057
女子監獄 第二季 第八集


2
00:01:20,356 --> 00:01:26,748
醫生建議雙側輸卵管至卵巢摘除術
The doctor recommends a bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy.

3
00:01:26,835 --> 00:01:29,915
誰會不喜歡有"摘除"這個詞的手術呢
Who doesn't love a surgery with "Ooph" in it?

4
00:01:34,734 --> 00:01:40,513
懲教署對這個有些限制...
The, uh, DOC has set certain limits on invasive...

5
00:01:47,681 --> 00:01:48,942
不能給你做
It's not gonna happen.

6
00:01:52,668 --> 00:01:55,676
你并非沒得選  我們可以繼續化療
You're not out of options. We'll stick with the chemo.

7
00:01:55,677 --> 00:01:56,619
"我們"
"We"?

8
00:01:57,468 --> 00:01:59,466
你卵巢里也有癌癥嗎
You got cancer in your ovaries, too?

9
00:02:00,231 --> 00:02:02,400
我是你的輔導員  我是幫你渡過難關的
I'm your counselor. I'm here to help you through this.

10
00:02:02,401 --> 00:02:04,428
沒什么"渡過難關"
There is no "Through this."

11
00:02:05,514 --> 00:02:06,595
我會死
I'm gonna die.

12
00:02:06,805 --> 00:02:10,799
別這樣  你能長命百歲呢
Hey. Come on, now. You could live for years.

13
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,964
-開他媽的什么玩笑  -注意語言
- That's a fucking lie. - Language!

14
00:02:13,559 --> 00:02:15,433
我知道這很艱難
Look, I know this is difficult for you.

15
00:02:15,906 --> 00:02:19,901
我堂兄得了肺癌  情況糟糕
My cousin had lung cancer. It didn't look good for him,

16
00:02:19,909 --> 00:02:21,117
但他堅持化療
but he stuck with the chemo

17
00:02:21,118 --> 00:02:23,533
現在又在奧尼昂塔修屋頂了
and now he's back fixing roofs in Oneonta.

18
00:02:23,572 --> 00:02:25,572
你堂兄真是走了好運
Lucky duck, your cousin.

19
00:02:26,043 --> 00:02:28,332
而我  走的是霉運
Me? Dead duck.

20
00:02:29,886 --> 00:02:34,776
你得盡量保持積極  沒人知道未來如何
You have to try to remain positive. No one knows the future.

21
00:02:34,816 --> 00:02:36,722
醫生知道
Doctors know the future.

22
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:40,034
他們認為我需要做手術
They think I need the surgery.

23
00:02:43,238 --> 00:02:44,640
但愿我可以幫你
I wish I could help you.

24
00:02:44,649 --> 00:02:50,117
但你幫不了  永遠都是如此
But it's out of your hands. It's always out of your hands.

25
00:02:51,706 --> 00:02:53,239
你們都一樣
You're all the same...

26
00:02:54,736 --> 00:02:56,148
沒用
useless.

10027
00:02:57,819 --> 00:03:00,031
羅莎  我牙里卡菜了嗎


28
00:03:00,032 --> 00:03:03,255
你怕他們覺得你不帥嗎  老天啊  馬爾科


29
00:03:03,256 --> 00:03:05,483
是你把菠菜放在蛋里的


30
00:03:05,484 --> 00:03:08,354
說起來  這樣很好吃啊


31
00:03:08,355 --> 00:03:10,005
謝謝  寶貝


32
00:03:10,528 --> 00:03:12,861
等下  還真卡了菜  我幫你...


33
00:03:12,862 --> 00:03:14,970
好了  完美


34
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:20,040
這個給你


35
00:03:22,381 --> 00:03:24,322
天哪  馬爾科


36
00:03:24,323 --> 00:03:26,313
你會做得很好的


37
00:03:26,314 --> 00:03:31,417
第一次誰都會緊張  但接著你會愛上這感覺的


38
00:03:31,418 --> 00:03:33,112
-知道嗎  -知道
- Okay? - Mmm-hmm. Okay.

39
00:03:33,667 --> 00:03:35,189
別忘了你的墨鏡


40
00:03:36,553 --> 00:03:38,404
好看嗎
Ahora si?

41
00:03:39,731 --> 00:03:41,546
事前一吻  事后一吻


42
00:03:55,336 --> 00:03:56,180
好了
Okay.

10043
00:03:56,859 --> 00:03:58,496
動手吧


44
00:04:09,962 --> 00:04:13,176
-所有人都趴在地上  -好好
- Suits, on the floor! Down! - Okay!

10045
00:04:13,307 --> 00:04:14,586
錢放袋子里


46
00:04:18,778 --> 00:04:19,848
趴著別動
Just stay down.

47
00:04:23,621 --> 00:04:26,041
不要染了墨的  我可不想要藍色的錢
No dye packs. Don't want no Smurf money.

10048
00:04:31,479 --> 00:04:32,972
快點


10049
00:04:32,973 --> 00:04:34,190
快


50
00:04:34,191 --> 00:04:34,921
把袋子裝滿
Fill the bag.

10051
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:45,446
我們走吧


10052
00:04:45,447 --> 00:04:46,545
走吧  寶貝


53
00:04:53,052 --> 00:04:53,831
不要
Don't!

10054
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:55,598
有警衛


55
00:05:08,381 --> 00:05:11,083
你他媽給我的槍怎么沒子彈


56
00:05:11,084 --> 00:05:15,147
搶劫拿著空槍有什么好處


57
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:16,642
讓你看起來很酷


58
00:05:16,643 --> 00:05:18,614
你不信任我


59
00:05:18,615 --> 00:05:20,840
槍支很危險


60
00:05:20,841 --> 00:05:23,096
要的就是危險


61
00:05:23,097 --> 00:05:27,977
寶貝  別生氣嘛  看看這么多錢


62
00:05:27,978 --> 00:05:29,188
你聞聞


63
00:05:30,103 --> 00:05:33,214
-好棒的氣味  -寶貝  棒極了


64
00:05:33,215 --> 00:05:34,786
比黑色達卡還棒


65
00:05:41,045 --> 00:05:42,797
天哪


66
00:05:44,003 --> 00:05:45,692
你在流血


67
00:05:46,418 --> 00:05:47,111
我們得送他去醫院


68
00:05:47,112 --> 00:05:48,431
他中槍了
He got hit?

69
00:05:48,432 --> 00:05:49,628
有多糟  馬爾科


70
00:05:49,811 --> 00:05:50,996
我們可以帶他去那個獸醫那里
We can take him to that vet.

71
00:05:57,235 --> 00:05:59,155
那個獸醫在哪


72
00:05:59,156 --> 00:06:00,725
為什么不去獸醫那里  安迪


73
00:06:02,477 --> 00:06:03,306
馬爾科
Marco.

74
00:06:04,085 --> 00:06:06,142
我們怎么辦  馬爾科  告訴我


75
00:06:07,858 --> 00:06:12,449
先給我事后吻  事前一吻  事后一吻


76
00:06:16,499 --> 00:06:17,667
你會沒事的


77
00:06:18,631 --> 00:06:20,288
你這么堅強


10078
00:06:21,067 --> 00:06:24,784
為我撐住  親愛的


79
00:06:25,818 --> 00:06:26,717
馬爾科
Marco?

80
00:06:35,697 --> 00:06:39,089
看起來不錯嘛  紅媽  發新芽了你看
Looking good, Red. You got a green thumb. Look at this.

81
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,654
這不是復雜的事
It's not rocket science.

82
00:06:43,795 --> 00:06:44,747
那是什么
What's that?

83
00:06:46,894 --> 00:06:48,770
我在想  我可以
I was thinking I could take a

84
00:06:48,771 --> 00:06:52,141
占用一點地方自己種點東西
little area for my own guys to bust out a little.

85
00:06:53,484 --> 00:06:54,985
種什么
What are you planting?

86
00:06:54,986 --> 00:06:56,270
蔬菜
Vegetables.

87
00:06:57,154 --> 00:06:59,948
別擔心  我會親自照顧的
Don't worry, I'll take care of 'em myself.

88
00:06:59,949 --> 00:07:03,159
早上過來給它們唱首歌
Come in in the morning, I'll sing 'em a little song...

89
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:05,120
每天早上嗎
Every morning?

90
00:07:05,121 --> 00:07:06,997
等天暖和點兒  我就把它們移到室外
When it gets warmer, I'll move 'em outside.

91
00:07:06,998 --> 00:07:09,332
你確定不會太早嗎
Are you sure it's not too early?

92
00:07:09,333 --> 00:07:11,284
因為如果他們在這里長得太大
Because if they grow too big in here,

93
00:07:11,285 --> 00:07:13,003
移栽可就難辦了
they might not transplant well.

94
00:07:13,004 --> 00:07:16,006
不就是一點蔬菜嘛  比如西葫蘆
It's just little bitch vegetables like squash.

95
00:07:16,007 --> 00:07:18,383
花椰菜可不是好處理的
Broccoli is no pussy.

96
00:07:18,384 --> 00:07:20,553
別擔心  我知道自己在做什么
Don't worry, I know what I'm talking about.

97
00:07:20,554 --> 00:07:23,388
這個盆對這株幼苗來說太大了
This pot is way too big for this seedling.

98
00:07:23,389 --> 00:07:25,702
你得確保排水沒問題...
You gotta make sure you're getting proper drainage here...

99
00:07:25,703 --> 00:07:27,008
別動
Don't!

100
00:07:29,186 --> 00:07:33,439
那是吉米的盆  是豆莖
That's Jimmy's pot. It's a bean stalk.

101
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:36,401
她覺得自己要從巨人那里偷琴呢
She thought she was going to steal a harp from a giant.

102
00:07:36,402 --> 00:07:38,895
整個簡直...
It was a whole... just...

103
00:07:40,614 --> 00:07:42,365
好吧
Okay.

104
00:07:42,366 --> 00:07:44,485
要是你擔心排水系統
If you're worried about the drainage,

105
00:07:45,369 --> 00:07:47,703
不如給我買些小點的花盆
maybe you could buy me some smaller pots.

106
00:07:47,704 --> 00:07:50,874
這些花盆應該沒什么問題
Yeah. They'll probably do just fine.

107
00:07:50,875 --> 00:07:53,043
把你的種子給我吧  我會給你播種的
Leave your seeds. I'll get your plants going.

108
00:07:53,044 --> 00:07:56,880
別了  我喜歡親力親為
Nah. Truth is, I like doing it myself.

109
00:07:56,881 --> 00:07:58,124
有益身心
Therapeutic.

110
00:07:59,383 --> 00:08:01,210
明天見
See you tomorrow.

111
00:08:02,469 --> 00:08:03,920
干得不錯
Good job.

112
00:08:19,861 --> 00:08:21,543
我得說
I have to say, 

113
00:08:21,544 --> 00:08:24,699
這事還挺讓人開心的
there is something gratifying about this, you know?

114
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:26,466
洗別人的衣服
Washing someone else's clothes,

115
00:08:26,467 --> 00:08:28,945
為他人服務
being of service to another human being.

116
00:08:30,081 --> 00:08:31,210
等你洗到
Well, just wait till you

117
00:08:31,211 --> 00:08:33,458
全是大姨媽的褲子
come across some of them period-soaked panties

118
00:08:33,459 --> 00:08:37,788
或者沾了屎的內褲再看你有多開心吧
or the shit stains on the undies and see how gratified you are.

119
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:41,299
我懂你的意思  蘇蘇
I get what you're saying, Soso.

120
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:44,253
拿來臟東西  再洗干凈
Taking something dirty, making it not dirty no more.

121
00:08:46,013 --> 00:08:49,090
說到洗
And speaking of washing.

122
00:08:50,476 --> 00:08:54,980
看到小賣部里新進了除臭劑嗎
You see they got a new kind of deodorant down at commissary?

123
00:08:54,981 --> 00:08:56,564
爽身粉味兒的
Powder fresh scent.

124
00:08:56,565 --> 00:08:57,857
-真的嗎  -是啊
- Is that right? - Yeah.

125
00:08:57,858 --> 00:08:59,567
我找時間去看看
Yeah, I may have to go check that out.

126
00:08:59,568 --> 00:09:03,196
止汗劑對人體非常不好
Guys, antiperspirant is so bad for you.

127
00:09:03,197 --> 00:09:05,573
超級有毒
You know, it's completely toxic.

128
00:09:05,574 --> 00:09:07,993
我們的身體應該自由呼吸
Our bodies are meant to breathe free.

129
00:09:07,994 --> 00:09:10,110
呼吸  是啊
Breathe, yeah.

130
00:09:10,111 --> 00:09:11,829
這話讓我希望
Yeah. You know, that makes me wish

131
00:09:11,830 --> 00:09:13,121
我們這兒能有些窗
that we had some windows down

132
00:09:13,122 --> 00:09:15,208
好通通風
here so we could air out the place, you know?

133
00:09:15,209 --> 00:09:17,494
她們想說你很臭
Yeah, they're trying to say you stink.

134
00:09:18,754 --> 00:09:20,505
真的嗎
I do?

135
00:09:20,506 --> 00:09:23,091
我們知道剛來這兒不容易
We know it's hard to get out of that depression funk thing

136
00:09:23,092 --> 00:09:24,853
脫離那種絕望
when you first get here but...

137
00:09:26,345 --> 00:09:28,255
你很臭
You reek.

138
00:09:29,306 --> 00:09:30,473
去洗澡吧
Go take a shower.

139
00:09:30,474 --> 00:09:32,176
好了  塔琪  別說了
All right, Tucky. Lay off.

140
00:09:34,311 --> 00:09:37,556
你說什么  琳恩  你才閉嘴
Excuse me? Leanne, you lay off.

141
00:09:38,649 --> 00:09:41,359
因為我認識的琳恩會告訴這個臟妞
'Cause the Leanne I knew would've told this dirty hippie

142
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,770
去洗洗她的下面
to go wash her hairy pits and her parts.

143
00:09:44,655 --> 00:09:47,948
但你現在想交新朋友了是嗎
But instead, you're off making new friends now, aren't ya?

144
00:09:47,949 --> 00:09:49,867
怎么樣
How's that going?

145
00:09:49,868 --> 00:09:51,827
感覺就不太好
Can't imagine well,

146
00:09:51,828 --> 00:09:55,498
因為真朋友不會兜圈子
because a real friend doesn't have to dance around the subject.

147
00:09:55,499 --> 00:09:58,418
真朋友會說實話
And a real friend just tells it like it is.

148
00:09:58,419 --> 00:10:00,878
學著點兒
Watch and learn.

149
00:10:00,879 --> 00:10:04,375
你聞著跟烏龜缸似的  趕緊他媽去洗個澡吧
You smell like a fucking turtle tank. Go take a fucking shower.

150
00:10:07,511 --> 00:10:10,180
一個80歲老太一個月忘洗澡了
You try washing an 80-year-old woman

151
00:10:10,181 --> 00:10:13,049
你卻想給她洗澡
when she's forgotten to shower for a month.

152
00:10:13,850 --> 00:10:17,353
這兒出了些怪事
Strange things grow in the folds.

153
00:10:17,354 --> 00:10:20,315
我們把吉米的事瞞了好多年了
We hid Jimmy's condition for years.

154
00:10:20,316 --> 00:10:23,526
她到處晃的時候我們花半天去找她
Spent half our days tracking her down when she wandered,

155
00:10:23,527 --> 00:10:26,154
想讓她及時趕回來點名
trying to get her back in time for count,

156
00:10:26,155 --> 00:10:28,698
看著她日況愈下
watching her get worse every day.

157
00:10:28,699 --> 00:10:32,993
她要怎么吃飯  要怎么照顧自己
How is she gonna eat? How is she gonna take care of herself?

158
00:10:32,994 --> 00:10:34,662
她會流落街頭  然后
She'll end up on the street and then...

159
00:10:34,663 --> 00:10:36,657
我猜撐不過一周
My guess, dead in a week.

160
00:10:37,874 --> 00:10:41,419
別誤會  他們干的事非常惡心
Don't get us wrong, it's disgusting what they done,

161
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:45,381
而她是  曾是一個很好的女人
and she is, was, a lovely woman.

162
00:10:45,382 --> 00:10:48,176
所以提前釋放只是踹了就跑
So compassionate release is really just a dump and run?

163
00:10:48,177 --> 00:10:50,050
更像是踹開
More like dump and sidle

164
00:10:50,051 --> 00:10:53,723
再偷偷溜走  他們就是這樣的人
away like the sneaky, shitty spiders they are.

165
00:10:53,724 --> 00:10:57,727
我認識一個記者  他也許能幫忙
I know this guy, a reporter. He might be able to help.

166
00:10:57,728 --> 00:11:00,013
《瘋老太獲釋》
"Demented Granny Set Free,"

167
00:11:00,014 --> 00:11:03,483
可不是什么性感標題  連新聞都稱不上
ain't a sexy headline and it ain't news.

168
00:11:03,484 --> 00:11:06,944
沒人關心老太太
No one gives a shit about old ladies.

169
00:11:06,945 --> 00:11:10,323
我們讓別人想到他們都難逃一死
We remind everyone that they're gonna die.

170
00:11:10,324 --> 00:11:12,025
我不這么看
I don't feel that way.

171
00:11:12,993 --> 00:11:15,286
我覺得在老人身邊很舒服
I find it comforting to be around old people.

172
00:11:15,287 --> 00:11:18,031
很高興能幫上忙
Glad we could be of service.

173
00:11:31,262 --> 00:11:33,679
我奶奶快死了
My grandmother is dying.

174
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,431
很遺憾
Sorry to hear that.

175
00:11:35,432 --> 00:11:37,050
她教我織東西
She taught me how to knit.

176
00:11:37,976 --> 00:11:40,395
我給我的毛絨猴子織了一條毯子
I made a blanket for my stuffed monkey.

177
00:11:40,396 --> 00:11:42,272
花了我六個月
It took me six months.

178
00:11:42,273 --> 00:11:45,483
然后我媽在庭院當舊貨賣了兩角五分
And then my mother sold it at a yard sale for a quarter.

179
00:11:45,484 --> 00:11:47,693
你媽可真討厭
Your mum sounds like a twat.

180
00:11:47,694 --> 00:11:49,187
有時是的
She can be.

181
00:11:50,447 --> 00:11:53,283
但我奶奶不是
But not my grandmother, no.

182
00:11:53,284 --> 00:11:54,743
我爺爺死時
When Granddad died, she

183
00:11:54,744 --> 00:11:57,870
她自學投資股票
taught herself how to invest in the stock market

184
00:11:57,871 --> 00:12:00,748
變得非常在行
and got really, really good at it.

185
00:12:00,749 --> 00:12:04,995
她在韋爾弗利特買了套房子
She bought herself a house in Wellfleet and...

186
00:12:05,962 --> 00:12:08,005
還開始劃皮劃艇了
she started kayaking.

187
00:12:08,006 --> 00:12:11,801
她以前總跟我說  "出去見見世面  帕波
She always used to say to me, "Go out and eat the world, Piper.

188
00:12:11,802 --> 00:12:14,212
別為了男人在家做家庭主婦"
"Don't you get stuck at home with some man."

189
00:12:15,472 --> 00:12:18,467
后面那句話我可能聽得有些片面了
I may have taken that last part too literally.

190
00:12:19,643 --> 00:12:21,011
查普曼
Chapman.

191
00:12:28,068 --> 00:12:29,485
我猜猜
Let me guess,

192
00:12:29,486 --> 00:12:32,322
親愛的查普曼小姐  沒人能休假
"Dear Miss Chapman, no one gets furlough.

193
00:12:32,323 --> 00:12:36,492
你不行  別人不行  尤其是你不行
"Not you, not anyone, but especially not you.

194
00:12:36,493 --> 00:12:38,869
敬上  懲教署  差不多嗎
"Love, the DOC." Am I warm?

195
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:40,913
-你可以休假了  -真有趣
- Got your furlough. - Funny.

196
00:12:40,914 --> 00:12:43,208
少諷刺了
Hey, watch the sarcasm.

197
00:12:43,209 --> 00:12:46,252
我撥了幾通電話  托了一點關系
I made a few phone calls, moved the process along.

198
00:12:46,253 --> 00:12:48,463
你可以去跟奶奶告別了
You get to go and say goodbye to your nana.

199
00:12:48,464 --> 00:12:49,956
天哪
Oh, my God!

200
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,505
我的天哪
Oh, my God!

201
00:12:57,514 --> 00:12:59,224
你說  你說真的嗎
Are you... Are you serious?

202
00:12:59,225 --> 00:13:02,302
別提問  查普曼  道謝就好
Don't ask questions, Chapman. Just say, "Thank you."

203
00:13:04,855 --> 00:13:06,139
謝謝
Thank you.

204
00:13:07,941 --> 00:13:09,726
太謝謝了
Thank you.

205
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:15,781
非常感謝  海利先生  謝謝
Thank you, Mr. Healy. Thank you.

206
00:13:15,782 --> 00:13:18,701
好了  不客氣
Okay. You're welcome.

207
00:13:18,702 --> 00:13:21,321
不客氣  查普曼  不客氣
You're welcome, Chapman. You're welcome.

208
00:13:22,664 --> 00:13:25,375
他剛是說"休假"了嗎
Did... Did he say furlough?

209
00:13:25,376 --> 00:13:28,870
你也太聾了  親愛的  誰能休假啊
You're deaf as a post, honey. No one gets a furlough.

210
00:13:30,881 --> 00:13:34,084
早上好  早  你好啊
Good morning. Morning. How are you?

211
00:13:36,887 --> 00:13:38,429
早上好啊美人
Good morning, sunshine.

212
00:13:38,430 --> 00:13:40,014
這是什么
What's this?

213
00:13:40,015 --> 00:13:42,392
是熱可可
It's a hot chocolate.

214
00:13:42,393 --> 00:13:45,291
有點甜  給我的...
A little sweet, for my...

215
00:13:45,708 --> 00:13:47,990
-給你  -謝謝  喬爾
- You. - Thanks, Joel.

216
00:13:52,444 --> 00:13:53,903
太燙了嗎
Was it too hot?

217
00:13:53,904 --> 00:13:55,613
這里面有烈酒嗎
Is there Schnapps in this?

218
00:13:55,614 --> 00:13:57,573
有
Yeah.

219
00:13:57,574 --> 00:13:58,991
那這杯是我的
That one's mine.

220
00:13:58,992 --> 00:14:00,910
你怎么回事
What's wrong with you?

221
00:14:00,911 --> 00:14:02,495
寶貝  這是增添風味
Babe, it's for flavor.

222
00:14:02,496 --> 00:14:03,566
別叫我寶貝
Don't call me babe.

223
00:14:03,567 --> 00:14:05,534
你不能回我短信就不能叫我寶貝
You can't call me babe if you can't return my texts.

224
00:14:05,535 --> 00:14:08,125
我要跟你說幾次  我不發短信的
How many times do I have to tell you, I don't text.

225
00:14:08,126 --> 00:14:10,878
好了  你要跟我聊天的話  就打電話吧
All right, if you wanna talk to me, call.

226
00:14:10,879 --> 00:14:12,713
或者開車來我家
Or drive over to my house.

227
00:14:12,714 --> 00:14:16,258
但是得半夜之后  等我室友睡著
You know, but after midnight, when my roommate's sleeping.

228
00:14:16,259 --> 00:14:19,845
卡普托  你看看  看到沒  你他媽看到沒
Caputo! Look at this. Do you see this? Do you fucking see this?

229
00:14:19,846 --> 00:14:22,348
你的鞋嗎  我看到了  很漂亮
Your shoe? I see your shoe. It's a nice shoe.

230
00:14:22,349 --> 00:14:24,099
-很漂亮  -高跟的
- Nice? - High.

231
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:28,103
這是一雙鞋底粘了口香糖的魯布托鞋
These are fucking Louboutins with gum on the sole.

232
00:14:28,104 --> 00:14:30,606
我踩到了口香糖  雙腳都沒進門呢
I stepped in gum, not two feet into the building.

233
00:14:30,607 --> 00:14:34,277
囚犯哪來的口香糖  口香糖是禁運品  卡普托
Where are the prisoners getting gum? Gum is contraband, Caputo.

234
00:14:34,278 --> 00:14:35,945
這貨是怎么進來
How the hell is it getting in,

235
00:14:35,946 --> 00:14:37,678
被嚼  被吐在地上
chewed, dropped and stuck

236
00:14:37,679 --> 00:14:40,533
然后粘在我昂貴的鞋上了
to the bottom of my very expensive shoe?

237
00:14:40,534 --> 00:14:43,160
-我不知道  -所以我才擔心
- I don't know. - And that's what concerns me.

238
00:14:43,161 --> 00:14:45,955
我在執行記過配額指標呢
I'm enforcing your shot quota.

239
00:14:45,956 --> 00:14:47,707
我已經盡我所能了
I'm doing everything I can.

240
00:14:47,708 --> 00:14:50,918
那就再加把勁  掌握控制權
Well, do better. Take control.

241
00:14:50,919 --> 00:14:52,768
你  你在這兒上班嗎
You, do you work here?

242
00:14:52,769 --> 00:14:54,630
-是的  女士  -別叫我"女士"
- Yes, ma'am. - Don't call me "Ma'am."

243
00:14:54,631 --> 00:14:56,882
我不是來買你東西的大媽
I'm not an old lady you're bagging groceries for.

244
00:14:56,883 --> 00:15:00,886
你是獄警  你的工作是執行規定
You are a correctional officer. Your job is to enforce the rules.

245
00:15:00,887 --> 00:15:02,972
-你知道都有些什么規定嗎  -知道
- Do you know what the rules are? - Yes.

246
00:15:02,973 --> 00:15:05,683
因為現在隨便看向哪兒
Because, right now, looking in an arbitrary direction,

247
00:15:05,684 --> 00:15:08,311
都能看到大耳環和不允許化的妝
I see large earrings, I see unapproved makeup.

248
00:15:08,312 --> 00:15:12,231
只有我看到了嗎  是我有透視眼嗎
Am I the only one who sees this? Do I have super vision?

249
00:15:12,232 --> 00:15:13,871
我跟《第六感》里那男孩一樣
Am I like the boy in The Sixth

250
00:15:13,872 --> 00:15:16,361
能看到別人看不到的東西嗎
Sense who sees infractions no one else sees?

251
00:15:16,362 --> 00:15:19,405
是我走進了奈特·沙拉馬拉馬的電影
Am I in a fucking M. Night Shalamalama movie,

252
00:15:19,406 --> 00:15:22,157
還是那個囚犯搽了綠色眼影
or is that inmate wearing green eye shadow?

253
00:15:22,158 --> 00:15:25,028
應該是叫沙馬蘭吧
I think it's pronounced Shyamalan.

254
00:15:26,913 --> 00:15:29,449
我還是先回去干活了
I, uh, better get back to work.

255
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:32,835
菲格羅亞小姐  大家都化妝
Miss Figueroa, everyone wears makeup.

256
00:15:32,836 --> 00:15:34,867
很好  那我就沒瘋
Oh, good, I'm not crazy.

257
00:15:34,868 --> 00:15:36,457
那你會做些什么
So are you gonna do something about it,

258
00:15:36,458 --> 00:15:38,007
還是站在這里當擺設呢
or are you just here for decoration?

259
00:15:38,008 --> 00:15:39,960
囚犯  等等
Inmate, hold up.

260
00:15:42,346 --> 00:15:43,804
那完全沒必要
That was totally unnecessary.

261
00:15:43,805 --> 00:15:47,224
我把她可憐巴巴的眼神搞得更慘兮兮了嗎
Oh, did I make her sad puppy dog eyes look even sadder?

262
00:15:47,225 --> 00:15:48,354
我知道你對她有些
Look, I know you have some

263
00:15:48,355 --> 00:15:50,436
愛情卡通片的感覺
kind of pathetic Love Is cartoon crush on her,

264
00:15:50,437 --> 00:15:51,687
但現在不是高中了
but this isn't high school.

265
00:15:51,688 --> 00:15:54,296
做好本分  不然我就另覓他人
Do your job, or I will find someone who will.

266
00:15:57,152 --> 00:15:59,479
叫這人洗個澡去
And make this one take a shower.

267
00:16:06,161 --> 00:16:08,538
一直累死了  我到哪睡哪
So fucking tired all the time, I fall asleep everywhere.

268
00:16:08,539 --> 00:16:10,448
我跟戀尸癖似的
It's like I'm a necrophiliac.

269
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:15,044
你們想到計劃什么的了嗎
You guys come up with a plan yet, or what?

270
00:16:15,045 --> 00:16:17,422
上一個想法是假裝我很胖
Last idea was to pretend I'm fat,

271
00:16:17,423 --> 00:16:20,315
在掃帚柜里生下來  然后從他的假腿里偷送出去
have it in the broom closet, and then sneak it out in his leg.

272
00:16:20,316 --> 00:16:21,842
他一定是在開玩笑
But I'm pretty sure he was kidding.

273
00:16:21,843 --> 00:16:24,094
但他可能說到點子上了
But he could be onto something though, you know?

274
00:16:24,095 --> 00:16:25,266
這里的人好像
People around here seem

275
00:16:25,267 --> 00:16:27,640
總有辦法把東西弄進來
to have all sorts of ways of gettin' shit in,

276
00:16:27,641 --> 00:16:30,468
也許你能想辦法反過來
so maybe you could figure out the reverse.

277
00:16:33,229 --> 00:16:38,233
上面是給廚房里的  下面是我姑娘們要的
Top's extra for my kitchen, bottom's some perks for my girls.

278
00:16:38,234 --> 00:16:39,735
可別出岔子
Don't want any drama.

279
00:16:39,736 --> 00:16:42,689
不會的  只是生意
No drama, just business.

280
00:16:58,714 --> 00:17:01,841
護士  你在采血還是給她紋身呢
Hey, lady, are you taking her blood or giving her a tattoo?

281
00:17:01,842 --> 00:17:03,295
我盡力呢
I'm doing my best.

282
00:17:03,296 --> 00:17:04,779
你的"盡力"爛爆了
Yeah, well, your best sucks.

283
00:17:05,070 --> 00:17:08,924
也許你一會兒會開始嘔吐  就不會這么多話了
Maybe you'll start vomiting soon so you can't talk so much, yes?

284
00:17:09,975 --> 00:17:12,135
趕緊把頭埋進桶里
Go stick your head in a bucket.

285
00:17:14,312 --> 00:17:17,982
謝謝你捍衛我的靜脈  桶仔
Thank you for defending my veins, bucket boy.

286
00:17:17,983 --> 00:17:20,610
她就是個沒用的賤人
Yeah, well, she's a useless bitch.

287
00:17:20,611 --> 00:17:22,277
她是個酒鬼
She's a drunk.

288
00:17:22,278 --> 00:17:23,946
你說什么呢
What are you talking about?

289
00:17:23,947 --> 00:17:27,950
看著  她會在窗口把血放下
Watch, she'll drop off the blood at the window,

290
00:17:27,951 --> 00:17:31,912
繞到后面放錢包的柜子
circle back to the cabinet where they keep their purses

291
00:17:31,913 --> 00:17:33,822
然后背對別人
and then she'll turn her

292
00:17:33,823 --> 00:17:37,285
喝點東西
back and she'll take a slug of something.

293
00:17:39,755 --> 00:17:44,341
然后關掉柜子  往嘴里扔塊口香糖
Then close it up and pop a piece of gum into her mouth.

294
00:17:44,342 --> 00:17:48,714
定時定點  每隔20分鐘左右
She's like clockwork, every 20 minutes or so.

295
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:54,143
我操  你一直在踩點啊
Shit! You've been casing the joint.

296
00:17:54,144 --> 00:17:57,288
我們有的是時間  你又沒那么有趣
We got time here. You're not that interesting.

297
00:17:57,454 --> 00:18:00,650
好吧  如果你要打劫
Okay, okay. So if you were gonna pull off a heist,

298
00:18:00,651 --> 00:18:03,360
就此時此地  你會怎么做
like, in this room, right now, how would you do it?

299
00:18:03,361 --> 00:18:08,115
我死前最后一次打劫嗎  這又不是電影  孩子
One last heist before I go? This isn't the movies, kid.

300
00:18:08,116 --> 00:18:10,861
別這樣吧  遷就我下  我也得了癌癥呢
No, come on, humor me. I have cancer.

301
00:18:12,788 --> 00:18:15,323
目標是誰  聰明鬼
Who's the mark, smartass?

302
00:18:18,126 --> 00:18:20,335
女酒鬼  偷她的錢包吧
Drunky bitch. Yeah, let's steal her wallet.

303
00:18:20,336 --> 00:18:23,164
行  我奉陪
Okay, fine. I'll play.

304
00:18:24,841 --> 00:18:28,553
我們今天走運  來的獄警是福特
We're lucky today. I got CO Ford.

305
00:18:28,554 --> 00:18:33,182
他每小時會走開去看看司機怎么樣
He actually gets off his ass to check the driver once an hour.

306
00:18:33,183 --> 00:18:37,144
用時五分鐘  然后會去上個廁所
Takes five minutes. Then he takes a bathroom break.

307
00:18:37,145 --> 00:18:38,353
那就是兩分鐘
So two minutes.

308
00:18:38,354 --> 00:18:39,555
不錯啊
Good.

309
00:18:40,566 --> 00:18:43,601
然后他會買杯咖啡  最多四分鐘
Then he takes a coffee, that's another four, tops.

310
00:18:44,611 --> 00:18:46,987
前臺是個抽煙的
And the receptionist is a smoker.

311
00:18:46,988 --> 00:18:50,308
她每三小時準點去摸魚
She takes a break every three hours, on the dot.

312
00:18:50,507 --> 00:18:52,577
那我怎么知道哪個錢包是女酒鬼的
So how do I know which purse is Drunky's?

313
00:18:52,578 --> 00:18:55,495
跟酒瓶放一塊兒的
Feel for the one with the flask.

314
00:18:55,496 --> 00:19:00,701
抽煙的那個上一次摸魚是1小時15分鐘之前
Smokey's last break was one-hour-fifteen ago.

315
00:19:02,045 --> 00:19:04,213
那怎么辦  我們就等著嗎
So what, do we just... We just wait?

316
00:19:04,214 --> 00:19:05,498
我們等著
We wait.

317
00:19:06,382 --> 00:19:09,218
你從斯坦韋路走會快一點
It'd be faster if you go down Steinway.

318
00:19:09,219 --> 00:19:10,970
但那里有建筑
Except there's construction.

319
00:19:10,971 --> 00:19:13,055
安迪  你得想辦法繞過去  行嗎
Andy, you gotta find a way around it, okay?

320
00:19:13,056 --> 00:19:14,348
沒問題
No problem.

321
00:19:14,349 --> 00:19:16,266
你倆能消停點嗎  這可是公事
Will you two stop? Hey, this is work.

322
00:19:16,267 --> 00:19:18,853
那就做事啊  傻逼  我搞得定
Work now, ass-play later. I got it.

323
00:19:18,854 --> 00:19:20,813
好了  聽著
Okay, listen.

324
00:19:20,814 --> 00:19:23,065
銀行里有三個出納  一個保安
We're looking at three tellers and one guard.

325
00:19:23,066 --> 00:19:26,986
保安我來對付  唐  你去拿錢
I'll cover the guard. Don, you do the cash. Okay?

326
00:19:26,987 --> 00:19:29,321
我們得在中午前搞定
And we gotta do this before noon,

327
00:19:29,322 --> 00:19:32,233
因為今天是周五  中餐后他們會加派人手
because it's Friday and they add extra people in after lunch.

328
00:19:34,535 --> 00:19:36,529
你能應付保安嗎
Can you handle the guard?

329
00:19:40,333 --> 00:19:42,160
這個傻逼
This fucking guy.

330
00:19:43,795 --> 00:19:46,539
我能應付貝賽德銀行的那個保安嗎
Could I handle the guard in Bayside?

331
00:19:47,465 --> 00:19:50,126
第一國家銀行的那兩個
The two in First National?

332
00:19:51,011 --> 00:19:54,422
在康美銀行嚇尿的可不是我  對吧  唐
Wasn't me who freaked out at Commerce Bank, was it, Don?

333
00:19:55,766 --> 00:19:57,217
好了
Okay.

334
00:19:58,101 --> 00:19:59,226
準備好出發了嗎
We ready to roll?

335
00:19:59,227 --> 00:20:00,895
走了
I'm off.

336
00:20:00,896 --> 00:20:03,057
等下  還有一件事
Hold up. One more thing.

337
00:20:03,774 --> 00:20:07,203
事前一吻  事后一吻


338
00:20:09,378 --> 00:20:11,695
你們每次都要這樣嗎
Oh, you gotta do this every time?

339
00:20:14,075 --> 00:20:15,200
這是好運
It's good luck.

340
00:20:15,201 --> 00:20:18,822
靠邊停  在這里停  就是那輛車  
Pull over. Pull over here. There's the car.

341
00:20:25,461 --> 00:20:27,963
安迪  你干什么  我們得換車  快啊
Andy, what are you doing? We gotta do the switch! Let's go.

342
00:20:27,964 --> 00:20:29,048
等一下
I need a minute.

343
00:20:29,049 --> 00:20:31,801
沒時間等了  快點  沒時間休息
Papi, we don't got minutes. Come on, there's no time to rest.

344
00:20:31,802 --> 00:20:33,003
羅莎
Rosa!

345
00:20:37,390 --> 00:20:38,974
他好像心臟病發了
I think he's having a heart attack.

346
00:20:38,975 --> 00:20:40,184
快走
Let's go.

347
00:20:40,185 --> 00:20:41,770
心臟病發


348
00:20:41,771 --> 00:20:44,188
求你  別這樣  親愛的
Please, don't do this, Papi. Please, okay?

349
00:20:44,189 --> 00:20:45,678
我們還要去看尼亞加拉大瀑布呢
We gotta see Niagara Falls, okay?

350
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:48,852
我們還要看山貓隊的比賽呢  求你了  親愛的
We got tickets to Cats. Please, Papi. Please.

351
00:20:54,449 --> 00:20:58,945
天哪  別再發生了  別又來一次
Oh, my God! This can't be happening again. Not again.

352
00:21:02,222 --> 00:21:04,409
找鑰匙  我來開車


353
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:16,963
我是卡蘿爾·查普曼
Hello, you've reached Carol Chapman.

354
00:21:17,764 --> 00:21:19,803
請留下姓名  電話號
Please leave your name, number,

355
00:21:19,804 --> 00:21:22,517
以及簡短的留言  我會...
and an ever so brief message and I'll...

356
00:21:22,518 --> 00:21:25,104
天哪  人都上哪去了
Oh, my God, where are they?

357
00:21:25,105 --> 00:21:27,606
一個囚犯只能打一通電話  有人排隊的
One call per inmate. There's a line.

358
00:21:27,607 --> 00:21:28,858
這都算不上是電話
That wasn't even a call.

359
00:21:28,859 --> 00:21:30,484
掛上電話  重新排隊
You hung up. Get back in line.

360
00:21:30,485 --> 00:21:32,938
我得給休假做些安排
I need to make arrangements for my furlough.

361
00:21:37,033 --> 00:21:38,367
行吧
Fine.

362
00:21:38,368 --> 00:21:42,621
維特利納太干了  綠維特利納是甜葡萄酒
Sure, it's dry for a Veltliner. Grune Veltliner is a sweet wine.

363
00:21:42,622 --> 00:21:45,240
我說了他不喜歡甜白酒
I told you he doesn't like sweet whites.

364
00:21:45,241 --> 00:21:47,877
所以你才沒拿到合同
That's why you didn't get the contract.

365
00:21:47,878 --> 00:21:50,413
而她簡直是在講小說
Meanwhile, she's dictating a novel.

366
00:21:51,715 --> 00:21:53,499
你  查普曼
You, Chapman...

367
00:21:55,551 --> 00:21:56,719
那是口紅嗎
that lip gloss?

368
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:00,055
不不  我天生的唇色
No, no, no, no. These are just my lips.

369
00:22:00,056 --> 00:22:01,556
那睫毛呢
What about the eyelashes?

370
00:22:01,557 --> 00:22:04,094
-也是天生的  -好吧
- I was born with them. - Fine.

371
00:22:05,896 --> 00:22:08,139
他不會讓我失望的
He wouldn't have let me down.

372
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:12,902
我操  這應該能點火啊
Shit. It's supposed to light on fire.

373
00:22:12,903 --> 00:22:15,237
簡直是我見過的最蠢的事
It's the dumbest fucking thing I've ever seen.

374
00:22:15,238 --> 00:22:17,072
你和費歇爾
Hey, am I wrong to assume

375
00:22:17,073 --> 00:22:20,034
是不是湊成一對兒了
that you and Fischer have been riding the hobby horse?

376
00:22:20,035 --> 00:22:21,819
我可不是八卦王  不過
I don't kiss and tell, but, uh...

377
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:24,163
我上了她
I fucked her.

378
00:22:24,164 --> 00:22:25,705
才沒呢
No, you didn't.

379
00:22:25,706 --> 00:22:28,417
-我抓了她的奶  -才沒呢
- I grabbed her boobs. - No, you didn't.

380
00:22:28,418 --> 00:22:30,620
-真的  -真的
- No, I did! - Really?

381
00:22:32,213 --> 00:22:34,589
比我厲害
It's farther than I got.

382
00:22:34,590 --> 00:22:37,634
-吃醋了  -完全沒有
- Jealous? - Nah. Not at all.

383
00:22:37,635 --> 00:22:39,712
現在我知道她品位很爛了
Now I know she has horrible taste.

384
00:22:42,182 --> 00:22:43,432
看到沒
See?

385
00:22:43,433 --> 00:22:46,219
我就說吧
Told you.

386
00:22:47,145 --> 00:22:48,728
這是什么原理
How does that even work?

387
00:22:48,729 --> 00:22:51,106
拜托  你才是電工的頭兒
Come on, you're head of electrical.

388
00:22:51,107 --> 00:22:53,150
我知道  不過原理到底是什么
Yeah, I know, but how's that work?

389
00:22:53,151 --> 00:22:54,609
盧斯奇
Luschek!

390
00:22:54,610 --> 00:22:55,811
囚犯
Inmate!

391
00:22:56,529 --> 00:22:59,406
這里最好有12節電池  再數一遍
There better be a dozen batteries there. Count 'em again.

392
00:22:59,407 --> 00:23:02,576
一  二  三...
One, two, three...

393
00:23:02,577 --> 00:23:06,621
我操  三后面是幾來著  我忘了
Fuck, man, what comes after three? I forgot.

394
00:23:06,622 --> 00:23:08,790
你沒在這里抽煙吧
You haven't been smoking out here, have you?

395
00:23:08,791 --> 00:23:10,876
為什么說我抽煙
Why do you assume I'm a smoker?

396
00:23:10,877 --> 00:23:12,377
因為你在奧斯維戈長大
'Cause you grew up in Oswego.

397
00:23:12,378 --> 00:23:16,124
我戒了  把錢都花在威士忌上了
Well, I quit. More money for whiskey.

398
00:23:17,843 --> 00:23:19,294
我聞到了煙味
I smell smoke.

399
00:23:24,807 --> 00:23:27,267
那是睫毛膏嗎  你怎么會有
Is that mascara? Why do you have mascara?

400
00:23:27,268 --> 00:23:29,345
因為小賣部有賣
'Cause they sell it at commissary.

401
00:23:32,983 --> 00:23:35,685
-好好管管你的人  -是
- Keep your people in line. - All right.

402
00:23:37,737 --> 00:23:39,355
她的奶子怎么樣
Now, what are those tits like?

403
00:23:39,530 --> 00:23:40,934
{\an8}獄警  他們也是人  這是蘇珊·費歇爾

404
00:23:41,491 --> 00:23:43,367
這些文章總是把的漫畫腰斬
That article keeps on cutting off my comic.

405
00:23:43,368 --> 00:23:45,244
他們都沒腳了
Now they got no feet!

406
00:23:45,245 --> 00:23:48,788
她穿了高跟鞋呢  現在我知道豬是指誰了
Oh, she's wearing heels! Now I get who the pig is.

407
00:23:48,789 --> 00:23:51,625
你應該再讓她背個錢袋
You should have her holding money bags, too.

408
00:23:51,626 --> 00:23:53,502
親愛的弗娜卡
"Dear Flaca,

409
00:23:53,503 --> 00:23:56,922
我的室友一直在偷我貨  我該怎么處理
"My bunkie's lifting my shit. How should I handle the situation?"

410
00:23:56,923 --> 00:23:58,257
不能說"貨"
You can't say, "Shit."

411
00:23:58,258 --> 00:24:01,176
不然怎么說  "賤人"嗎  因為弗娜卡說
Well, can I say, "Bitch"? 'Cause here's what Flaca say,

412
00:24:01,177 --> 00:24:03,971
盡量說服賤人別再偷東西
"Try to reason with the bitch to lay off the sticky fingers,

413
00:24:03,972 --> 00:24:05,253
但如果她不聽
"But if she doesn't listen,

414
00:24:05,254 --> 00:24:07,016
就拖她去個沒人的地方
"You know, drag her to a place where no one can see,

415
00:24:07,017 --> 00:24:09,385
給她一頓胖揍
"And bash her head real good."

416
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:11,307
耶穌看到了
Jesus saw that.

417
00:24:11,308 --> 00:24:12,823
這些都不能寫
You can't write any of that.

418
00:24:12,824 --> 00:24:15,774
你知道管理員需要審核簡報
You know the administration needs to approve all of this.

419
00:24:15,775 --> 00:24:18,735
你讓她去小賣部買把牢固的鎖吧
Why don't you tell her to go buy a sturdy lock at the commissary?

420
00:24:18,736 --> 00:24:20,237
我就這意思
That's what I'm saying.

421
00:24:20,238 --> 00:24:23,740
買把鎖  藏在襪子里  然后放倒那賤人
Buy a lock, stick it in a sock and slock the bitch down.

422
00:24:23,741 --> 00:24:27,286
不  我們得完成這個  最晚明天必須完成
No. We have to finish this up. This has to be done by tomorrow.

423
00:24:27,287 --> 00:24:29,079
不是周二才截止嗎
I thought we had till Tuesday?

424
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:30,915
我周二不在
I won't be here Tuesday.

425
00:24:30,916 --> 00:24:32,791
怎么  你要請事假
Oh, what, you takin' a personal day?

426
00:24:32,792 --> 00:24:34,209
不  我拿到休假了
No, I got furlough.

427
00:24:34,210 --> 00:24:35,335
-真的嗎  -不
- For real? - No...

428
00:24:35,336 --> 00:24:36,836
慢著  絕對不可能
Wait, no fucking way.

429
00:24:36,837 --> 00:24:40,507
真的  我奶奶病了  我申請然后通過了
Yeah. My grandmother's sick. I applied and it went through.

430
00:24:40,508 --> 00:24:41,841
我也申請了
I applied, too!

431
00:24:41,842 --> 00:24:44,761
我還讓人給典獄長打了電話  根本屁都沒用
I even had people call the warden. That shit never works!

432
00:24:44,762 --> 00:24:46,513
是啊  我幾乎都放棄了
I know. I had almost completely given up.

433
00:24:46,514 --> 00:24:48,685
現在  我可以去跟她道別
Now... Now I get to go, say goodbye.

434
00:24:48,686 --> 00:24:50,517
告訴她我有多愛她
Tell her how much I love her.

435
00:24:50,518 --> 00:24:53,020
五分鐘內就道完別
Yo, get that shit out of the way in, like, in five minutes.

436
00:24:53,021 --> 00:24:55,314
超快說完你要說的話
You know, say what you gotta say, like, super quick.

437
00:24:55,315 --> 00:24:57,066
就說  "安息吧  奶奶
Then be like, "Peace, abuelita!

438
00:24:57,067 --> 00:24:58,645
我會在夜店
"I'll be in the club with

439
00:24:58,646 --> 00:25:01,570
點杯長島冰茶  使勁扭屁股"
my Long Island and my fatty, making it clap!"

440
00:25:01,571 --> 00:25:03,523
她的白屁股可扭不起來
No way that white ass is gonna clap.

441
00:25:05,450 --> 00:25:06,796
姑娘們會嫉妒你的
Girls are gonna be pissed at you.

442
00:25:06,797 --> 00:25:08,953
-我現在就有點想揍你  -我也是
- I kinda wanna punch you right now. - Me, too.

443
00:25:08,954 --> 00:25:10,266
你最好小心點
You better watch your back.

444
00:25:10,511 --> 00:25:13,373
-你拿到休假了  查普曼  -是的
- You got furlough, Chapman? - I did.

445
00:25:13,374 --> 00:25:16,668
我在天主教堂待了好多年
I've been in the Catholic Church a lot of years

446
00:25:16,669 --> 00:25:19,372
老實說這是我第一次見到上帝的奇跡
and this is my first honest-to-goodness miracle.

447
00:25:20,381 --> 00:25:21,465
好好利用這一次
Use it well.

448
00:25:21,466 --> 00:25:23,258
我會的
I will.

449
00:25:23,259 --> 00:25:27,221
我會去找我奶奶
I'm gonna go and be with my grandmother

450
00:25:27,222 --> 00:25:30,591
問她所有我沒來得及問的問題
and ask her all the questions I never got to ask.

451
00:25:35,063 --> 00:25:36,306
這是什么
What is that?

452
00:25:37,107 --> 00:25:41,686
冰沙  甘藍菜  棗子和杏仁乳
Smoothie. Kale and dates and, uh, almond milk.

453
00:25:43,238 --> 00:25:48,242
-你抽煙嗎  -不抽  但我有時會嚼煙草
- You smoke? - No, but I chew tobacco sometimes.

454
00:25:48,243 --> 00:25:51,286
嚼煙草就白喝甘藍菜了  不是嗎
Chewing tobacco defeats the purpose of drinking kale, doesn't it?

455
00:25:51,287 --> 00:25:55,408
我會想也許它們互相抵消
Well, I like to think that they cancel each other out, maybe.

456
00:25:55,958 --> 00:25:58,502
你有什么事嗎  還是...
Um, can I help you with something? Or...

457
00:25:58,503 --> 00:25:59,961
禁運品
Contraband.

458
00:25:59,962 --> 00:26:01,713
我覺得自己簡直在玩"打鼴鼠"的游戲
I feel like I'm playing whack-a-mole here.

459
00:26:01,714 --> 00:26:05,467
我在一處砸中了它  它又在另一處跑出來了
I beat it down in one place and it pops up in another.

460
00:26:05,468 --> 00:26:07,636
你看到什么的話記得告訴我
You need to tell me if you see anything.

461
00:26:07,637 --> 00:26:10,590
好的
Yeah, of course. Yeah.

462
00:26:11,474 --> 00:26:14,809
想都別想保護誰
Don't you dare try to protect anyone.

463
00:26:14,810 --> 00:26:17,896
我知道這很難  你在這里交到了朋友
I know it's hard. I know you make friends in this place.

464
00:26:17,897 --> 00:26:21,108
-不  我沒有...  -你有  時有發生
- No, I, I don't... I don't... - You do. It happens.

465
00:26:21,109 --> 00:26:25,029
有時你都沒意識到
Sometimes you don't even realize it's happening, and,

466
00:26:25,030 --> 00:26:27,531
突然之間  就發現自己相信別人了
all of a sudden, you find yourself trusting somebody.

467
00:26:27,532 --> 00:26:29,283
你問別人意見
You're asking somebody advice...

468
00:26:29,284 --> 00:26:33,112
那個人可不是你的朋友  那個人...
That person is not your friend. That person...

469
00:26:35,456 --> 00:26:37,166
怎么了
What?

470
00:26:37,167 --> 00:26:38,993
我操
Fuck.

471
00:26:40,836 --> 00:26:46,501
我了個大草
The fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

472
00:26:52,515 --> 00:26:55,885
看看我  我還在這兒呢
Oh, hey, look at me, I'm still here.

473
00:26:57,019 --> 00:26:59,188
我只是盡本分  莫里洛
I'm just doing my job, Morello.

474
00:26:59,189 --> 00:27:02,023
費歇爾帶羅莎來時從來不來查崗
Fischer never came to visit when she had Rosa.

475
00:27:02,024 --> 00:27:03,317
你知道她會做什么嗎
You know what she'd do?

476
00:27:03,318 --> 00:27:05,540
一天結束  她會給我帶希斯酒吧
She'd bring me a Heath bar and a cold Dr.

477
00:27:05,541 --> 00:27:07,196
和冷的胡椒博士
Pepper at the end of the day.

478
00:27:07,197 --> 00:27:09,281
是不是超體貼
Isn't that thoughtful?

479
00:27:09,282 --> 00:27:12,652
也許你來查崗時也可以這么做
Maybe you could do that when you come to check on me.

480
00:27:14,537 --> 00:27:17,081
-下一小時再見  莫里洛  -好吧
- I'll see you in an hour, Morello. - Okay, fine, fine.

481
00:27:17,082 --> 00:27:18,149
也許你可以就給我
Maybe you could just bring

482
00:27:18,150 --> 00:27:19,916
帶個空瓶子來好讓我撒尿
me an empty bottle that I could pee into.

483
00:27:19,917 --> 00:27:21,396
我不能離開這車  對吧
I can't leave the van, right?

484
00:27:21,397 --> 00:27:23,378
你可以下車到后面蹲坑
Oh, you can get out and take a squat in the back

485
00:27:23,379 --> 00:27:24,664
然后再上車
and then get back in.

486
00:27:26,048 --> 00:27:30,336
太好了  謝謝  太感謝你了
Okay, great. Thank you. Thank you so much.

487
00:27:39,354 --> 00:27:42,097
我要去廁所了
Uh, well, I'm going off to the bathroom.

488
00:27:43,483 --> 00:27:45,560
真是個蠢貨


489
00:27:46,277 --> 00:27:50,572
護士小姐  能來一下嗎
Nurse? Nurse? Can you come over here, please?

490
00:27:50,573 --> 00:27:51,740
沒什么事吧
Is everything okay?

491
00:27:51,741 --> 00:27:54,444
我的閥門好像漏了
I think my port is leaking.

492
00:27:56,871 --> 00:27:58,705
沒有啊  沒什么問題
No, looks fine to me.

493
00:27:58,706 --> 00:28:02,167
這戒指真漂亮
Oh, what a beautiful ring!

494
00:28:02,168 --> 00:28:05,044
有多大  兩克拉嗎
What is that? Two carats?

495
00:28:05,045 --> 00:28:06,130
是的
It is.

496
00:28:06,131 --> 00:28:08,173
怎么  你還是珠寶賊
What, were you a jewel thief?

497
00:28:08,174 --> 00:28:11,676
不  我對珠寶沒什么興趣  不過我喜歡閃閃的
Nah, that was never my main gig, but I like the bling.

498
00:28:11,677 --> 00:28:14,596
-六千塊  -少了
- Six grand? - Warm.

499
00:28:14,597 --> 00:28:18,767
-七千  八千  -八千五
- Seven? Eight? - Eight and a half.

500
00:28:18,768 --> 00:28:20,935
我未婚夫是大型連鎖超市的地區經理
My fiance is a regional manager for Foodtown.

501
00:28:20,936 --> 00:28:23,313
-他省了...  -他真厲害
- He had to save up for... - Good for him.

502
00:28:23,314 --> 00:28:27,017
我有點渴了  能給我倒杯水嗎
I'm a little thirsty. Can I have some water, please?

503
00:28:28,110 --> 00:28:29,486
行
Yeah, sure.

504
00:28:29,487 --> 00:28:30,855
假警報
It was a false alarm.

505
00:28:35,117 --> 00:28:37,277
我操啊  小屁孩
The fuck, kid?

506
00:28:51,509 --> 00:28:56,881
沒想到我會為63塊錢這么激動
I never thought I'd get so excited over $63.

507
00:28:59,975 --> 00:29:02,060
-才20塊  -這是你的分成
- $20? - That's your cut.

508
00:29:02,061 --> 00:29:05,314
-所有事都是我干的  -整個行動是我策劃的
- I did all the work! - I was the brains of the operation.

509
00:29:05,315 --> 00:29:06,773
尤瑟夫·米瑞馬迪
Yusef Miremadi.

510
00:29:06,774 --> 00:29:08,058
都是她策劃的
She was the brains.

511
00:29:09,777 --> 00:29:11,020
你媽媽來了
Your mom is here.

512
00:29:13,614 --> 00:29:15,114
醫生要跟你們談談
The doctor needs to speak with you.

513
00:29:15,115 --> 00:29:16,734
媽媽的乖寶寶
Mama's boy.

514
00:29:20,621 --> 00:29:23,366
我會回來的  這可沒完
I will be back. Okay, but this is not enough.

515
00:29:26,336 --> 00:29:27,787
永遠沒完
It's never enough.

516
00:29:31,006 --> 00:29:33,175
五萬塊
Fifty grand!

517
00:29:33,176 --> 00:29:34,801
還沒到家呢  先別激動
We're not home yet. Cool it.

518
00:29:34,802 --> 00:29:37,804
這么認真
Oh, so serious.

519
00:29:37,805 --> 00:29:41,183
來吧  事前一吻  現在該事后吻了
Come on, we kissed before. It's time for the after kiss.

520
00:29:41,184 --> 00:29:42,760
你知道我不會這么做的
You know I won't do that.

521
00:29:43,206 --> 00:29:44,998
別  這會帶來霉運
No. It's bad luck.

522
00:29:46,138 --> 00:29:48,709
別鬧了  我們還要再開一段路
Cut it out. We gotta drive more!

523
00:29:50,110 --> 00:29:51,724
就在這里停車
Pull over right here.

524
00:29:54,337 --> 00:29:57,525
你因為搶劫而性致高昂  行
You're all hot from the job? Fine.

525
00:30:03,705 --> 00:30:05,029
你干什么
What are you doing?

526
00:30:05,208 --> 00:30:08,252
我不想操  我想搶銀行
I don't wanna fuck now. I wanna rob that bank.

527
00:30:08,253 --> 00:30:10,995
-我們才剛搶過  -再搶一家
- We just did one. - Let's do one more!

528
00:30:10,996 --> 00:30:12,881
我們對這家銀行一無所知  好嗎
We don't know nothing about that bank. Okay?

529
00:30:12,882 --> 00:30:15,827
我們不知道誰在工作  警報器在哪
We don't know who's working, where the alarms are. All right?

530
00:30:15,828 --> 00:30:18,478
簡直瘋了  我不干
This is crazy. I'm not doing it.

531
00:30:18,554 --> 00:30:20,555
我不需要你
Well, I don't need you.

532
00:30:20,556 --> 00:30:22,341
你需要我的  羅莎
Yes, you do need me, Rosa.

533
00:30:23,518 --> 00:30:24,719
你干什么
What are you doing?

534
00:30:26,562 --> 00:30:29,606
看看你  因為拿到休假覺得自己碉堡了
Look at you thinking you're all hot shit 'cause you got furlough.

535
00:30:29,607 --> 00:30:31,065
我真該給你剃個短短頭
I ought to give you a skullet.

536
00:30:31,066 --> 00:30:32,150
什么是短短頭
What's a skullet?

537
00:30:32,151 --> 00:30:34,228
就是光頭只留小辮兒
A mullet with the top shaved.

538
00:30:35,821 --> 00:30:39,408
就這樣吧  我家人以為我出去會是彪悍的重罪犯
Well, you might as well. My family is expecting a hardened felon.

539
00:30:39,409 --> 00:30:41,910
讓他們滿意一次也好
It would be nice to meet their expectations for once.

540
00:30:41,911 --> 00:30:45,865
你在自由世界有48小時  有宏偉計劃了嗎
You got 48 hours in the free world, kid. You got big plans?

541
00:30:47,833 --> 00:30:49,535
跟我的家人在一起
Be with my family...

542
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:52,712
看著我奶奶過世
watch my grandmother fade away.

543
00:30:52,713 --> 00:30:55,089
別這樣  太浪費了
Oh, come on. That can't be it.

544
00:30:55,090 --> 00:30:57,634
你會跟你丈夫一起嗎
You gonna stay with your husband?

545
00:30:57,635 --> 00:30:59,469
不  他不是我丈夫
No... Well, he's not my husband.

546
00:30:59,470 --> 00:31:02,806
我都不知道我們還是不是朋友
And I don't even know if we're friends anymore.

547
00:31:02,807 --> 00:31:04,241
我想到我的家
I mean, when I think of my home,

548
00:31:04,242 --> 00:31:05,892
我想到我們一起住的地方
I think of where we lived together,

549
00:31:05,893 --> 00:31:09,604
但我不住在那里了
but I don't live there anymore.

550
00:31:09,605 --> 00:31:13,149
我都不知道我的東西還在不在那里
I don't even know if my stuff is still there.

551
00:31:13,150 --> 00:31:16,361
我的乳液還在不在洗手臺上
I don't even know if my lotions are on the sink,

552
00:31:16,362 --> 00:31:18,572
還是他全把我的東西收進袋子里
or if he took them all and he put them in a bag

553
00:31:18,573 --> 00:31:20,782
漏得整個都是了
and they're all just leaking all over each other.

554
00:31:20,783 --> 00:31:23,785
還是就把我的東西留在原處
Or if he just left them there.

555
00:31:23,786 --> 00:31:29,283
他可千萬別改變  或者做出  或者注意任何事
God forbid he should change, or do, or notice anything.

556
00:31:34,297 --> 00:31:37,249
我倆現在的關系有點棘手
Things are a little complicated between us right now.

557
00:31:38,551 --> 00:31:40,175
你怎么做到的  查普曼
So, how'd you do it, Chapman?

558
00:31:40,176 --> 00:31:42,554
你給海利什么"好處"了嗎
Did you give Healy a little reach-around?

559
00:31:42,555 --> 00:31:44,431
天哪  才沒有
God, no, no. No!

560
00:31:44,432 --> 00:31:47,976
沒有  他們可能真是終于同情我了
No, I think that they might've finally taken pity on me.

561
00:31:47,977 --> 00:31:50,680
我將要失去我愛的人
I mean, I'm about to lose somebody that I love.

562
00:31:51,647 --> 00:31:55,650
也許  這所監獄還是有點良心的
Maybe, maybe, this prison has a heart after all.

563
00:31:55,651 --> 00:31:57,276
放屁吧
Bullshit!

564
00:31:57,277 --> 00:31:58,737
我申請了兩次
I applied twice.

565
00:31:58,738 --> 00:32:00,701
我丈夫進行開胸手術
When my husband had open heart

566
00:32:00,702 --> 00:32:03,992
以及我第一個孫子出生時
surgery and for the birth of my first grandchild.

567
00:32:03,993 --> 00:32:06,278
他們讓我滾蛋
They told me to go fuck myself.

568
00:32:07,372 --> 00:32:11,867
從沒抱過那孩子  但我真的很想抱
Never held the baby. And I love me some baby holding.

569
00:32:12,752 --> 00:32:14,704
我也申請過
I applied, too.

570
00:32:16,130 --> 00:32:17,296
沒同意
Nothing.

571
00:32:17,297 --> 00:32:18,757
申請干什么
What for?

572
00:32:18,758 --> 00:32:21,418
我父親進行了移植肺臟  但排斥了
My father had a lung transplant that didn't take.

573
00:32:22,345 --> 00:32:26,681
我變性后咱倆就沒說過話  他真的很拗
We hadn't spoken since I transitioned. He was a real hard-ass.

574
00:32:26,682 --> 00:32:29,218
但最后  他開始找我
But in the end, he started asking for me.

575
00:32:30,978 --> 00:32:34,724
他甚至叫我的新名字  索菲婭
He even used my new name, Sophia.

576
00:32:35,650 --> 00:32:39,528
人之將死其言也善
People get soft, you know, when they dying.

577
00:32:39,529 --> 00:32:42,106
如果我當時見到他了  或許...
If I could've seen him, I don't know...

578
00:32:43,198 --> 00:32:45,025
會有種了卻心結的感覺
may have felt like closure.

579
00:32:45,868 --> 00:32:49,446
但我們這輩子是沒多少機會了  不是嗎
But we don't get a lot of that in this life now, do we?

580
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:53,325
這是我后悔清單里的一項
Add it to my list of regrets.

581
00:32:56,837 --> 00:33:00,165
但是奶奶  也很重要
But grandmothers, they important, too.

582
00:33:04,053 --> 00:33:05,887
你干什么
What are you doing?

583
00:33:05,888 --> 00:33:07,639
找什么呢
What are you looking for?

584
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:09,474
說話啊
Use your words.

585
00:33:09,475 --> 00:33:10,850
在哪
Where is it?

586
00:33:10,851 --> 00:33:13,721
什么  香菜  西葫蘆嗎
What? The cilantro, the squash?

587
00:33:15,731 --> 00:33:17,899
你是要砸碎每個花盆嗎
Are you gonna smash every pot?

588
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:19,233
必須的
You bet your ass.

589
00:33:19,234 --> 00:33:22,897
這次你最后一次騙我了  紅媽
This is the last time, Red, you pull one over on me.

590
00:33:23,823 --> 00:33:27,442
行吧  讓我幫你
All right. Let me help you.

591
00:33:28,243 --> 00:33:30,279
怎么  咱們現在干的不就是這個嗎
What? Isn't this what we're doing now?

592
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:33,289
不是嗎
Isn't this what we're doing?

593
00:33:33,290 --> 00:33:36,952
這兒  最后一盆  你要親手砸碎嗎
Here, this is the last one. You wanna do the honors?

594
00:33:38,128 --> 00:33:39,622
不要
No?

595
00:33:41,090 --> 00:33:43,292
行了  就這樣
Okay, then. That's that.

596
00:33:44,677 --> 00:33:47,178
但愿你覺得有益身心
I hope it was therapeutic for you.

597
00:33:47,179 --> 00:33:49,409
我不介意被批評  不是這回事
I don't mind being criticized, it's not that,

598
00:33:49,410 --> 00:33:51,862
我只是覺得她要是這么堅持執行規定
I just think that if she's so set on enforcing the rules,

599
00:33:51,863 --> 00:33:53,573
也許就不該在囚犯面前
then maybe she shouldn't undermine my authority

600
00:33:53,574 --> 00:33:54,649
讓我難堪
in front of the inmates.

601
00:33:54,650 --> 00:33:57,481
有些人用暴力管制  有些人則用魅力
Some of us control with muscle, some of us control with charm.

602
00:33:57,482 --> 00:33:59,608
咱倆就是靠魅力的
You know, you and me, we're charm.

603
00:33:59,609 --> 00:34:01,610
有什么好笑的
Something funny?

604
00:34:01,611 --> 00:34:03,267
記過配額指標爛透了
This whole shot quota's a bad idea.

605
00:34:03,268 --> 00:34:05,196
對大家都不好受
It's making things harder for everyone.

606
00:34:05,197 --> 00:34:06,615
還有一大堆文書工作
And all the friggin' paperwork.

607
00:34:06,616 --> 00:34:10,619
我倒是不介意  給了我坐下來的時間
I don't mind the paperwork. Gives me a chance to get off my feet.

608
00:34:10,620 --> 00:34:13,329
如果你忙著做文書工作  牢里打起架
But what if you're tied up doing paperwork and a fight breaks out

609
00:34:13,330 --> 00:34:15,034
發生暴亂了怎么辦
and it turns into a prison riot?

610
00:34:15,035 --> 00:34:16,526
你本可以阻止的  卻沒阻止成
And you could've stopped it, but you didn't,

611
00:34:16,527 --> 00:34:19,002
因為你在辦公室做文書工作
because you were in your office doing paperwork?

612
00:34:19,003 --> 00:34:21,295
你有沒有做過拯救全人類的英雄夢
You ever have those dreams where you save everybody?

613
00:34:21,296 --> 00:34:22,922
有時吧
Sometimes.

614
00:34:22,923 --> 00:34:26,134
有一次  我榮獲了國會榮譽勛章
One time, I received the Congressional Medal of Honor.

615
00:34:26,135 --> 00:34:27,419
真厲害
Nice.

616
00:34:39,607 --> 00:34:40,808
干什么
What?

617
00:34:41,651 --> 00:34:43,602
有話快說  有屁快放
You got something to say, out with it.

618
00:34:44,405 --> 00:34:46,402
我們認為記過配額指標不合理
We don't think the shot quota's reasonable.

619
00:34:46,408 --> 00:34:47,830
對情況沒什么益處
It doesn't improve conditions.

620
00:34:47,831 --> 00:34:50,700
會讓囚犯和獄警之間產生懷疑
It creates mistrust between the inmates and the staff.

621
00:34:50,701 --> 00:34:52,385
你想讓她們相信你
You'd like them to trust you more?

622
00:34:52,386 --> 00:34:53,484
我想讓她們認為
Well, I'd like them to think

623
00:34:53,485 --> 00:34:55,288
她們受管束是公正的
that when they're disciplined, it's justified.

624
00:34:55,289 --> 00:34:57,184
不然的話  誰還會照章辦事
I mean, otherwise, why follow the rules at all?

625
00:34:57,185 --> 00:34:57,842
對我們也是如此
And the same goes for us.

626
00:34:57,843 --> 00:34:59,387
我認為我被人吼是不公平的
I don't think it's fair that I was yelled at.

627
00:34:59,388 --> 00:35:02,420
我要管理這座監獄
In order for me to run this facility,

628
00:35:02,421 --> 00:35:05,840
你們所有人就得聽我指示行事
I need all of you to comply with my directives

629
00:35:05,841 --> 00:35:08,176
不管你們認為合不合理
whether you find them "Reasonable" or not.

630
00:35:08,177 --> 00:35:10,128
規矩是上面定下來的
The rules come from the top down.

631
00:35:10,129 --> 00:35:11,093
但這些規矩
Yeah, but there are rules

632
00:35:11,094 --> 00:35:12,635
我們根本就不嚴格執行
that we don't even enforce consistently.

633
00:35:12,636 --> 00:35:13,765
卻被責怪...
And then we get blamed...

634
00:35:13,766 --> 00:35:15,462
費歇爾  現在不是
Fischer! This is not the

635
00:35:15,463 --> 00:35:18,937
適當的時機或地點來向我抱怨
appropriate time or place to air your complaint.

636
00:35:18,938 --> 00:35:22,064
卡普托先生  抱歉  我是有話直說
Well, Mr. Caputo, I'm sorry, but I have to speak my mind.

637
00:35:22,065 --> 00:35:23,119
你不能專橫地懲罰別人
You can't just punish someone

638
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:24,693
就為了殺雞儆猴...
arbitrarily to make an example of them...

639
00:35:24,694 --> 00:35:26,478
你被解雇了
You're fired.

640
00:35:27,617 --> 00:35:29,106
什么
What?

641
00:35:36,539 --> 00:35:37,782
我警告過你了
I tried to warn you.

642
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:44,246
這個月的薪水會發給你
You'll be paid through the end of the month.

643
00:35:57,685 --> 00:36:01,055
還有人強烈渴望直抒胸臆嗎
Does anyone else have the burning desire to speak their mind?

644
00:36:03,899 --> 00:36:05,434
很好
Good.

645
00:36:07,152 --> 00:36:10,739
白人妞  給我吧  我來就行
Oh, Blanca, Blanca, I got that. I got that. Damelo.

646
00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:11,937
去洗攪拌器
Go clean the mixer.

647
00:36:11,938 --> 00:36:14,111
那不是瑪麗薩干的嗎


648
00:36:14,112 --> 00:36:16,149
拜托  那姑娘被關禁閉回來以后
Please. That girl's as useless as balls on a dildo

649
00:36:16,150 --> 00:36:17,211
整個人跟假雞巴一樣廢
since she came back from seg.

650
00:36:17,212 --> 00:36:20,032
她才待了多久  三分鐘
And she was there, what? Three minutes?

651
00:36:21,667 --> 00:36:23,243
有事嗎
Can I help you?

652
00:36:23,878 --> 00:36:25,204
給你帶了禮物
Brought you a gift.

653
00:36:27,715 --> 00:36:30,258
我不需要陳年舊煙
I don't need no more stale-ass tobacco.

654
00:36:30,259 --> 00:36:34,095
這算是補償  新貨  我保證
This is to make up for that. This is fresh, I promise.

655
00:36:34,096 --> 00:36:37,265
在里面加了點薄荷  變成薄荷醇了
Put some peppermint in it, turned it into a menthol.

656
00:36:37,266 --> 00:36:39,759
被獄警抓到了  你就要被記過了
CO catches you back here, you gonna get a shot.

657
00:36:40,853 --> 00:36:45,231
你跟紅媽現在關系不錯啊
So, uh, you and, uh... you and Red on friendly terms now?

658
00:36:45,232 --> 00:36:46,885
跟你無關
Doesn't concern you.

659
00:36:46,999 --> 00:36:50,575
那女人還真知道怎么俘獲人心
Damn, that woman knows how to run a game on people.

660
00:36:50,576 --> 00:36:51,821
我可以給你講幾個故事
I could tell you some stories.

661
00:36:51,822 --> 00:36:53,035
你聽過
Hey, have you ever heard

662
00:36:53,036 --> 00:36:55,241
蝎子和青蛙的寓言嗎
of the fable of the scorpion and the frog?

663
00:36:55,242 --> 00:36:57,118
怎么  我他媽是青蛙嗎
What, I'm the fucking frog?

664
00:36:57,119 --> 00:37:00,288
你倆狼狽為奸  我知道她在做些勾當
You two in cahoots. I know she's doing business.

665
00:37:00,289 --> 00:37:01,455
我猜猜
Let me guess.

666
00:37:01,456 --> 00:37:04,059
你有賣家關系  她幫你散貨
You've got a vendor connection and she's handling your sales.

667
00:37:04,060 --> 00:37:05,174
我只是來做飯的
I'm just here to cook.

668
00:37:05,175 --> 00:37:07,217
紅媽干的事跟我毫無關系
Whatever Red's got going, got nothing to do with me.

669
00:37:08,380 --> 00:37:10,173
要合伙人嗎
You want a partner?

670
00:37:10,174 --> 00:37:12,175
我保證我比她更好
I promise I'm a much better bet,

671
00:37:12,176 --> 00:37:15,553
因為紅媽只想要回她的廚房
because all Red wants is to get her kitchen back.

672
00:37:15,554 --> 00:37:17,889
你給我好好聽著
You listen to me.

673
00:37:17,890 --> 00:37:20,550
你自以為知道些什么  其實并沒有
Whatever you think you know, you don't.

674
00:37:21,644 --> 00:37:24,520
我手不臟  沒破事
I'm keeping my hands clean, my shit polished.

675
00:37:24,521 --> 00:37:28,650
我跟供應商或者非法贓物流入都沒關系
I got no connections with vendors or illegal swag coming through.

676
00:37:28,651 --> 00:37:32,153
你們這些瘋婆娘我一個都不信
And I don't trust any of you crazy bitches.

677
00:37:32,154 --> 00:37:34,773
你倆都他媽是蝎子
You're both fucking scorpions.

678
00:38:06,355 --> 00:38:10,642
操  我操我操  媽逼
Shit. Shit, shit, shit. Fuck.

679
00:38:11,651 --> 00:38:13,995
整體來看
Hey, listen, in the grand scheme of things,

680
00:38:13,996 --> 00:38:15,462
香煙是什么
I mean, what's a cigarette, really?

681
00:38:15,463 --> 00:38:16,698
就是卷在紙里的植物
You know, it's a plant and some paper.

682
00:38:16,699 --> 00:38:19,242
你想想我可能會干的各種恐怖事件
When you think about all the horrible things I could be doing.

683
00:38:19,243 --> 00:38:22,154
隨你抽吧  我無所謂了
Smoke all you want. I don't care anymore.

684
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:24,907
我被炒了
I got fired.

685
00:38:26,333 --> 00:38:27,500
真好
Hey, good for you.

686
00:38:27,501 --> 00:38:29,085
你不明白
You don't get it.

687
00:38:29,086 --> 00:38:31,504
我現在該怎么辦  我沒有一技之長
What am I gonna do now? I'm not good at stuff.

688
00:38:31,505 --> 00:38:33,415
你肯定不擅長這行
Well, for sure, you weren't great at this.

689
00:38:34,258 --> 00:38:36,718
這可是褒獎你  相信我
But that reflects highly on you, trust me.

690
00:38:36,719 --> 00:38:40,263
我有醫保和牙保  還在還我的起亞車貸
I had medical and dental. I was paying off my Kia.

691
00:38:40,264 --> 00:38:43,266
你是個好人
You're a decent human being, you know.

692
00:38:43,267 --> 00:38:45,559
脫離這個吸食靈魂的破地方
Getting canned from this soul-sucking pit

693
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:47,896
是你身上發生的最好的事
is the best thing that ever happened to you.

694
00:38:47,897 --> 00:38:49,702
回家去  洗個熱水澡
Go home, take a hot bath,

695
00:38:49,703 --> 00:38:52,817
開始找找專科學校
and start looking into technical colleges.

696
00:38:52,818 --> 00:38:56,112
或者美容  學習腋窩和敏感區脫毛
Or cosmetology. Learn to wax armpits and vag lips.

697
00:38:56,113 --> 00:38:58,565
外面大千世界等著你呢
There's a million things out there for you.

698
00:39:02,745 --> 00:39:05,079
-我能問你一個問題嗎  -問吧
- Can I ask you a question? - Yeah, shoot.

699
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:08,117
前不久  你是在跟我調情嗎
Like, a while back, were you hitting on me?

700
00:39:08,959 --> 00:39:11,036
不做夢就要死  對吧
We don't dream, we die, right?

701
00:39:13,213 --> 00:39:15,790
我做得怎么樣
So, how'd I do?

702
00:39:16,759 --> 00:39:18,426
我想了一下
I thought about it.

703
00:39:18,427 --> 00:39:19,510
真的假的
Seriously?

704
00:39:19,511 --> 00:39:21,630
騙你的
Not in a thousand years.

705
00:39:23,808 --> 00:39:25,134
不過謝了
But thank you.

706
00:39:26,894 --> 00:39:32,641
蘇珊  收拾東西離開這里
Susan, pack your shit and get the fuck out of here.

707
00:39:38,155 --> 00:39:39,906
你會沒事嗎
Are you gonna be okay?

708
00:39:39,907 --> 00:39:41,441
就這樣了
It is what it is.

709
00:39:46,956 --> 00:39:48,823
寶貝  你被炒了
Babe, you got fired?

710
00:39:51,043 --> 00:39:52,661
真糟
Lame.

711
00:40:05,474 --> 00:40:06,883
讓我去看看他
Let me go see him.

712
00:40:07,810 --> 00:40:09,060
我們得回去
We need to get back.

713
00:40:09,061 --> 00:40:11,585
這是我越獄計劃的一部分
It's all part of my escape plan.

714
00:40:11,586 --> 00:40:15,100
他會用眼淚轉移你的注意
He's going to distract you with his tears.

715
00:40:24,076 --> 00:40:25,694
等我一下
Just give me a second.

716
00:40:29,456 --> 00:40:30,865
簡直是詛咒
It's the fucking curse.

717
00:40:31,959 --> 00:40:35,954
我拉你入伙  我沒吻你  但咱倆還是干了一票
I pull you in. I don't kiss you, but still, we did a job.

718
00:40:36,396 --> 00:40:37,922
你在說什么呢
What are you talking about?

719
00:40:37,923 --> 00:40:40,842
我說過  我生命中的男人全死了
I told you, all the men in my life die.

720
00:40:40,843 --> 00:40:43,136
我不是你生命中的男人  好嗎
I'm not a man in your life. Okay?

721
00:40:43,137 --> 00:40:44,971
你自己說的  我就是個小屁孩
You said so yourself, I'm a little shitpot.

722
00:40:44,972 --> 00:40:47,424
你這么年輕怎么能死
You're too fucking young to die.

723
00:40:50,733 --> 00:40:52,020
所以我不會死的
So I'm not gonna die.

724
00:40:52,021 --> 00:40:54,473
我不用做化療了  我進入緩解期了
I'm done with chemo. I'm in remission.

725
00:41:01,530 --> 00:41:04,365
羅莎  跟你一起很有意思
Listen, Rosa, it's been a lot of fun hanging out.

726
00:41:04,366 --> 00:41:05,984
我受益良多
It's been a trip.

727
00:41:06,826 --> 00:41:08,403
恭喜
Congratulations.

728
00:41:11,373 --> 00:41:12,456
享受監獄
Enjoy prison.

729
00:41:12,457 --> 00:41:15,619
享受生活  小屁孩
Enjoy your life, shitpot.

730
00:41:21,466 --> 00:41:24,718
我該說什么
So, what should I say?

731
00:41:24,719 --> 00:41:27,339
你說對了  我錯了
You was right, I was wrong?

732
00:41:30,225 --> 00:41:34,429
應該跟你合伙的  我顯然沒法一個人干
Should've stuck with the band. I'm clearly not a solo artist.

733
00:41:35,564 --> 00:41:38,942
但至少你還活著  詛咒沒克死你
But at least you're still alive. The curse never got you.

734
00:41:38,943 --> 00:41:42,729
我從沒跟你事后吻過  也許就是這樣救了我
Well, I never did the after kiss. Maybe that's what saved me.

735
00:41:44,031 --> 00:41:45,607
我為什么要那么做
Why did I do that?

736
00:41:46,700 --> 00:41:48,152
你不想上我
You didn't wanna fuck me.

737
00:41:48,994 --> 00:41:52,496
我想啊
Oh, but I did.

738
00:41:52,497 --> 00:41:55,242
只是想在更大的錢床上
Just on a bigger bed of money.

739
00:41:56,919 --> 00:41:58,287
我真貪婪
Greedy me.

740
00:41:59,171 --> 00:42:01,456
我好想那氣味  唐尼
I miss the smell, Donny.

741
00:42:02,341 --> 00:42:05,794
我愛現金的氣味
I love the smell of cash, man.

742
00:42:07,262 --> 00:42:12,467
那種激情  表演  刺激
The excitement, the performance, the rush.

743
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:19,183
我在這里怎么找刺激啊
What am I gonna do in here for kicks?

744
00:42:20,150 --> 00:42:22,610
查普曼一來就受到了
You know, Chapman been getting special treatment

745
00:42:22,611 --> 00:42:24,362
特殊照顧
since the minute she got here.

746
00:42:24,363 --> 00:42:27,115
她好像是第一個拿到休假的人
Figures she'd be the first to get furlough.

747
00:42:27,116 --> 00:42:29,117
我真他媽浪費了
Man, I fucking blew it.

748
00:42:29,118 --> 00:42:31,619
我離開了這破地方兩周
I had a solid two weeks out of this joint,

749
00:42:31,620 --> 00:42:35,289
但一半時間都在找你這個逼
and I wasted half that time looking for your sorry ass.

750
00:42:35,290 --> 00:42:37,584
去死  是你自己破壞了假釋條例
Fuck that. You done found time to violate your probation,

751
00:42:37,585 --> 00:42:39,585
又滾回了這里
land your wide butt back up in here.

752
00:42:39,586 --> 00:42:42,880
賤人  至少你還見過這圍欄之外的日光
Bitch, at least you seen daylight outside this fence.

753
00:42:42,881 --> 00:42:45,841
我申請休假整整六個月
Man, I tried for six months to get furlough.

754
00:42:45,842 --> 00:42:47,218
顯然一個死去的黑人老媽
Clearly a dead black mom

755
00:42:47,219 --> 00:42:49,677
比不上一個病了的白人老太
ain't no competition for a sick, old white granny.

756
00:42:49,678 --> 00:42:52,181
你和你家男人都不在一起了
You and your man aren't even together no more.

757
00:42:52,182 --> 00:42:54,225
太浪費
What a waste.

758
00:42:54,226 --> 00:42:57,728
要是我出去了  肯定和凱撒操一整天
If I got out, me and Cesar would be fucking all damn day.

759
00:42:57,729 --> 00:43:00,106
我和迪艾保會沒日沒夜地操
Diablo and I would go all day and all night.

760
00:43:00,107 --> 00:43:01,983
生病的奶奶
Sick abuela.

761
00:43:01,984 --> 00:43:04,311
你他媽是怎么想到這個橋段的
The fuck you came up with that one?

762
00:43:08,907 --> 00:43:12,326
天哪  查普曼  大家都恨透你了
Christ, Chapman, everybody hates your fucking guts.

763
00:43:12,327 --> 00:43:14,488
是嗎  還有什么新消息
Yeah, what else is new?

764
00:43:15,664 --> 00:43:19,625
嫉妒與死亡一樣強烈  所羅門之歌
"Jealousy is as fierce as the grave," Song of Solomon.

765
00:43:19,626 --> 00:43:20,709
托妮·莫里森的嗎
Toni Morrison?

766
00:43:20,710 --> 00:43:22,078
是《圣經》  親愛的
The Bible, sweetie.

767
00:43:25,590 --> 00:43:28,259
這里人的爸媽過世了
Man, people's parents fucking go.

768
00:43:28,260 --> 00:43:31,012
這里的病人得不到應有的照料
Got sick people in here who can't get proper treatment.

769
00:43:31,013 --> 00:43:33,097
查普曼一生順風順水
Chapman ain't got no strife in her life,

770
00:43:33,098 --> 00:43:35,425
但那賤人就是有一條康莊大道
but bitch gets the red carpet laid out for her.

771
00:43:37,811 --> 00:43:38,936
歧視黑人啊
The new Jim Crow.

772
00:43:38,937 --> 00:43:41,348
那賤人可能跪下了
Bitch probably got down on her knees.

773
00:43:42,149 --> 00:43:44,692
含好了海利那粉粉的雞巴
Took a mouthful of that pink Healy dick.

774
00:43:44,693 --> 00:43:47,195
是啊  我是白人
Yes, I am white!

775
00:43:47,196 --> 00:43:48,779
大家都知道
We have established that.

776
00:43:48,780 --> 00:43:50,323
我也拿到了休假
And I got furlough, too.

777
00:43:50,324 --> 00:43:52,075
看來白人特權又贏了
I guess white privilege wins again.

778
00:43:52,076 --> 00:43:55,869
作為整個白種人的發言人
And as a speaker for the entire white race,

779
00:43:55,870 --> 00:44:00,833
我想說很遺憾你們受到了不公平待遇
I would like to say I am sorry that you guys got the raw deal,

780
00:44:00,834 --> 00:44:04,579
但我他媽愛我奶奶
but I love my fucking grandmother.

781
00:44:05,380 --> 00:44:09,125
是啊  她也有些白
And, yeah... yeah, she may be a whitey, too...

782
00:44:10,009 --> 00:44:12,303
但她是個人
but she's a fucking person...

783
00:44:12,304 --> 00:44:13,922
她病了
and she's sick...

784
00:44:14,931 --> 00:44:17,342
她需要我
and she needs me!

785
00:44:21,188 --> 00:44:23,390
都他媽給老娘閉上嘴
So shut the fuck up!

786
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:38,204
跟我沒關系
It's not my problem.

787
00:44:38,205 --> 00:44:40,998
你和小維有矛盾  別扯上我
You and Vee got beef, don't drag me into your shit.

788
00:44:40,999 --> 00:44:43,751
我以為波多黎各人討厭黑人呢
I thought Puerto Ricans hated black people.

789
00:44:43,752 --> 00:44:45,086
我們也不喜歡俄羅斯人
We don't like Russians neither.

790
00:44:45,087 --> 00:44:47,130
-她是個惡霸  -你倆都是
- She's a bully. - You're both fucking bullies

791
00:44:47,131 --> 00:44:49,090
而我不信你們任何人
and I don't trust neither one of you.

792
00:44:49,091 --> 00:44:51,592
我說了會幫你  我也幫了
Now I said that I will help you and I did.

793
00:44:51,593 --> 00:44:53,469
但我不會卷入什么
But I am not gonna get caught up

794
00:44:53,470 --> 00:44:56,555
黑白種人大混戰之中的
in the middle of some whitey versus blackie war.

795
00:44:56,556 --> 00:44:59,392
你們都有黑歷史  我可不想跟你們有關系
Y'all got history, I want nothing to do with that.

796
00:44:59,393 --> 00:45:01,394
我會盡快弄出去的
I'll get it out as soon as I can.

797
00:45:01,395 --> 00:45:03,604
給你三天
You've got tres dias.

798
00:45:03,605 --> 00:45:06,315
英文說就是"三天"
That's "Three days" In English.

799
00:45:06,316 --> 00:45:08,692
是  夫人
Se, senora.

800
00:45:08,693 --> 00:45:12,238
不過你就只能做到這份上嗎
In the meantime, is that really the best that you can do?

801
00:45:12,239 --> 00:45:13,947
什么
What?

802
00:45:13,948 --> 00:45:15,567
我救了你一命  賤人
I saved your ass, bitch.

803
00:45:18,662 --> 00:45:21,146
你的東西  安全得很
Here's your shit, all safe and sound.

804
00:45:22,291 --> 00:45:24,799
你想讓卡普托去你的溫室大鬧一場嗎
You want Caputo playing hot and cold in your greenhouse?

805
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:25,612
咱們現在就能去
'Cause we can go right

806
00:45:25,613 --> 00:45:27,336
你那小小的種植系統
back to your little planter system right now.

807
00:45:27,337 --> 00:45:30,881
行吧  算我謝你了
Okay, okay. I appreciate the gesture.

808
00:45:30,882 --> 00:45:33,084
給我點時間等風頭過去
Give me a little time for things to cool down.

809
00:45:34,719 --> 00:45:36,337
你要的東西來了
I've got your order coming.

810
00:45:37,138 --> 00:45:38,847
交易還繼續
Deal's still on.

811
00:45:38,848 --> 00:45:42,051
咱倆沒事吧  沒事
We're good, you and me, huh? We're good.

812
00:45:57,826 --> 00:46:01,494
海利先生  我不能休假  我想退掉
Mr. Healy, I can't take my furlough. I wanna give it back.

813
00:46:02,035 --> 00:46:04,081
這兒有人比我更需要
There are people here who are way more needy.

814
00:46:04,082 --> 00:46:06,250
這兒有人的父母生病了
There are people here whose parents are sick.

815
00:46:06,251 --> 00:46:08,752
-孩子們...  -天哪  你什么毛病
- Children... - For Christ's sake, what is with you?

816
00:46:08,753 --> 00:46:12,541
我都不明白你這次為什么要幫我
Look, I don't even understand why you did this for me.

817
00:46:13,675 --> 00:46:16,878
你討厭我  大家都不明白
You hate me! Nobody gets this!

818
00:46:18,680 --> 00:46:22,683
查普曼  我早上
Chapman, I spent my morning

819
00:46:22,684 --> 00:46:26,854
跟一位老太說她有末期癌癥
telling an old lady that she has terminal cancer

820
00:46:26,855 --> 00:46:30,858
還有懲教署不會報銷她手術費用的
and that the DOC won't cover her surgery.

821
00:46:30,859 --> 00:46:33,193
她說我沒用
And she said I was useless.

822
00:46:33,194 --> 00:46:36,447
你知道嗎  她說得對
And you know what? She was right.

823
00:46:36,448 --> 00:46:39,199
我開始這份工作時  充滿了理想
When I started this job, I was very idealistic.

824
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:41,034
我想做出些改變
I was gonna make a difference.

825
00:46:41,035 --> 00:46:44,538
但我就是個弄文書的  我填表
But I'm a paper pusher. I fill out forms.

826
00:46:44,539 --> 00:46:49,627
我做的大部分事就是保持你們安全整潔
Most of what I do is, I keep you safe and clean.

827
00:46:49,628 --> 00:46:52,880
偶爾  就那么偶爾一次
And occasionally, once in a blue moon,

828
00:46:52,881 --> 00:46:57,586
我會有個機會把表格申請上去
I get an opportunity to give one of those forms an extra nudge.

829
00:47:00,972 --> 00:47:04,224
-多數人會感激  -我很感激
- Most people would be grateful. - I was.

830
00:47:04,225 --> 00:47:05,426
真的
I am!

831
00:47:06,353 --> 00:47:08,763
但現在我變成了眾矢之的
Until it turned me into a target!

832
00:47:13,151 --> 00:47:15,569
不能退回休假
There's no taking back furlough.

833
00:47:15,570 --> 00:47:16,904
你的車準備好以后
When your ride is ready,

834
00:47:16,905 --> 00:47:20,900
你就能上車去看你生病的奶奶了
you be in that car on your way to see your sick grandmother.

835
00:47:23,662 --> 00:47:27,706
姑娘們會竊竊私語  羨慕嫉妒
And girls will talk and they'll get jealous,

836
00:47:27,707 --> 00:47:28,793
是的  她們甚至
and, yes, it's possible

837
00:47:28,794 --> 00:47:31,001
可能會在你睡著時弄死你
they may even try to slock you in your sleep,

838
00:47:31,002 --> 00:47:32,961
不過別理她們
but ignore them.

839
00:47:32,962 --> 00:47:36,299
查普曼  人都有一死  錯過了就來不及了
Chapman, people die, and you don't get that moment back.

840
00:47:36,300 --> 00:47:39,134
你得去見她  告訴她你有多愛她
So you go and see her and you tell her how much you love her

841
00:47:39,135 --> 00:47:42,638
以及你多懊悔讓她失望了
and you tell her how sorry you are for letting her down.

842
00:47:42,639 --> 00:47:44,390
得做到問心無愧
You clear your conscience.

843
00:47:44,391 --> 00:47:46,434
重點是向她告別
This is about saying goodbye.

844
00:47:46,435 --> 00:47:49,554
我給你這個機會  好好把握
I'm giving you that. Take it.

845
00:47:53,274 --> 00:47:54,809
好吧  我會的
Okay, I will.

846
00:47:56,945 --> 00:47:59,606
你這輔導員還不算太糟嘛
That wasn't bad. Your counseling.

847
00:48:05,036 --> 00:48:07,113
你做得很好
You did a good job.

848
00:48:21,260 --> 00:48:22,629
早安
Morning.

849
00:48:23,847 --> 00:48:25,931
我給你帶了些盆栽
I brought you some plants.

850
00:48:25,932 --> 00:48:27,558
看到它們現在在小盆里了嗎
They're in smaller pots, you see?

851
00:48:27,559 --> 00:48:29,352
你要把它們種在這里面
You're gonna grow 'em in here?

852
00:48:29,353 --> 00:48:31,304
不  是你來種
No, these are for you.

853
00:48:33,648 --> 00:48:38,019
我才不把它們種這里面  我沒時間
Uh, I'm not gonna grow in here. I don't have the time.

854
00:48:38,862 --> 00:48:41,856
我會找新的休閑方式
I'll find some other way to relax.

855
00:48:45,785 --> 00:48:47,946
一定要讓紅媽收到  行嗎
Make sure Red gets those, okay?

856
00:48:57,589 --> 00:49:00,758
如果你能有出獄一天的機會  你會想怎么使用
If you had one day on the outside, how would you spend it?

857
00:49:00,759 --> 00:49:05,012
去我以前的市場  吃俄羅斯小餡餅
Oh... go to my market, taste the pirozhkis,

858
00:49:05,013 --> 00:49:08,348
確保達米特里有繼續在好好做
make sure Dimitri hasn't let it all go to shit.

859
00:49:08,349 --> 00:49:11,769
吃什么  俄羅斯小什么
The what? The piroso... Pirosis?

860
00:49:11,770 --> 00:49:13,521
小餡餅
Pirozhkis.

861
00:49:13,522 --> 00:49:16,524
含餡的餅  跟肉餅很像
Stuffed buns, like a meat pie.

862
00:49:16,525 --> 00:49:18,526
我以前做這個很出名
I was famous for them.

863
00:49:18,527 --> 00:49:20,944
周日的時候店門外會大排長龍呢
On Sunday there'd be a line out the door.

864
00:49:20,945 --> 00:49:23,363
是我一周中最喜歡的日子
It was my favorite day.

865
00:49:23,364 --> 00:49:28,368
我能想象到顧客們跟家人嬉笑怒罵
I'd imagine the families laughing, talking, fighting,

866
00:49:28,369 --> 00:49:31,489
一邊吃著我的小餡餅
all while enjoying my pirozhkis.

867
00:49:37,546 --> 00:49:41,332
店在皇后區  坐地鐵N號線很快能到
It's in Queens, a quick ride on the N train.

868
00:49:42,383 --> 00:49:43,627
你會去嗎
Will you go?

869
00:49:45,136 --> 00:49:46,219
去你的店嗎
To your place?

870
00:49:46,220 --> 00:49:49,139
我要不是擔心  我也不會問
I wouldn't ask if I wasn't worried.

871
00:49:49,140 --> 00:49:50,891
我希望有人能去幫我看看
I need someone to check it out,

872
00:49:50,892 --> 00:49:53,302
點個三明治  看看店里
order a sandwich, take a look...

873
00:49:54,771 --> 00:49:56,104
告訴我現在店里情況怎么樣
let me know how it's running.

874
00:49:56,105 --> 00:49:58,231
你不能叫你兒子們看嗎
Can't you ask your sons?

875
00:49:58,232 --> 00:50:00,943
我覺得他們沒跟我說實話
I don't think they're being honest with me.

876
00:50:00,944 --> 00:50:02,926
我知道你家里有事
I know you have family business.

877
00:50:02,927 --> 00:50:05,363
如果不是很重要  我也不會麻煩你
I wouldn't ask if it wasn't important.

878
00:50:05,364 --> 00:50:08,033
我不確定...
I'm not sure if...

879
00:50:08,034 --> 00:50:10,243
我得去醫院
I need to be at the hospital.

880
00:50:10,244 --> 00:50:11,612
知道
Of course.

881
00:50:12,581 --> 00:50:14,490
我不知道我有沒有空
I don't know if I'll have time.

882
00:50:15,500 --> 00:50:17,167
但我有空會去看看的
I'll go if I can.

883
00:50:17,168 --> 00:50:18,418
你有空再去就行了
Only if you have time.

884
00:50:18,419 --> 00:50:21,004
怎么說來著  小仙冰
How do you say that? Pirosees?

885
00:50:21,005 --> 00:50:24,208
-小餡餅  -小餡餅
- Pirozhkis. - Pirozhkis.

886
00:50:26,845 --> 00:50:28,672
美味一絕
The best.

887
00:50:30,431 --> 00:50:31,932
這里是怎么回事
Hell, what's with the back up?

888
00:50:31,933 --> 00:50:33,760
拉丁妞們頭發太多了
Latin girls have a lot of hair.

889
00:50:34,603 --> 00:50:36,269
你們這樣是不對的
This is not right.

890
00:50:36,270 --> 00:50:39,773
你們不能逼我洗澡  我又沒有傷害到別人
You cannot force me to shower. I'm not hurting anybody.

891
00:50:39,774 --> 00:50:42,234
我的鼻子不同意  而且收到四次投訴了
My nose would disagree, and four complaints have been filed.

892
00:50:42,235 --> 00:50:44,152
規定里寫著得定期洗澡
It's in the rules. You shower regularly.

893
00:50:44,153 --> 00:50:45,696
這定期是誰定的
Who determines what's regular?

894
00:50:45,697 --> 00:50:47,280
天哪  去C區吧
Christ. Let's go to C Block.

895
00:50:47,281 --> 00:50:49,567
不要  我拒絕
No, I refuse.

896
00:50:51,327 --> 00:50:53,487
我現在是被動反抗
I am demonstrating passive resistance.

897
00:50:56,082 --> 00:50:58,792
我們是主動出擊
We are demonstrating aggressive aggression.

898
00:50:58,793 --> 00:51:00,411
寶佳康蒂[《風中奇緣》女主]  走吧
Let's go, Pocahontas.

899
00:51:02,631 --> 00:51:05,583
-脫衣服  蘇蘇  -不要
- Off with it, Soso. - No!

900
00:51:30,965 --> 00:51:32,993
賤人  你最好趕緊洗完
You better wash fast, bitch.

901
00:51:32,994 --> 00:51:36,990
因為馬上就會涌出屎了
Because a shit storm coming up out of there any second now.

902
00:51:38,499 --> 00:51:41,418
科杰克
Hey, hey, hey, Kojak.

903
00:51:41,419 --> 00:51:44,922
昨天怎么樣了  有看到你的朋友嗎
How'd it go yesterday? Did you see your little friend?

904
00:51:44,923 --> 00:51:46,457
他在緩解期
He's in remission.

905
00:51:48,176 --> 00:51:50,385
這是好事  對吧
That's wonderful, right?

906
00:51:50,386 --> 00:51:52,095
對他來說是好事
Wonderful for him.

907
00:51:52,096 --> 00:51:55,842
別這樣  很快你也會沒事的
Come on. Soon you'll be gettin' your clean bill of health.

908
00:51:57,686 --> 00:52:00,638
不  我很快就要死了
No, soon I'm gonna be dead.

909
00:52:03,692 --> 00:52:09,563
我一直以為自己會是在一片火光
I always pictured myself going out in a blaze of glory.

910
00:52:10,657 --> 00:52:15,444
槍聲四起  汽車爆沖的情景下離開
Hail of gunfire, screech of tires.

911
00:52:20,875 --> 00:52:23,161
但這種死法
But this kind of death...

912
00:52:25,338 --> 00:52:30,593
緩慢又看不見地
this slow, invisible...

913
00:52:30,594 --> 00:52:33,587
讓我的生命慢慢流逝
disappearing into nothing...

914
00:52:36,099 --> 00:52:38,176
太可怕了
It's terrifying.

915
00:52:44,983 --> 00:52:47,852
我要繼續睡覺了
I'm gonna go back to sleep now.

916
00:52:48,778 --> 00:52:51,739
這化療讓我精疲力盡
The chemo, it wipes me out.

917
00:52:51,740 --> 00:52:55,484
你睡吧
Yeah. You do that.

918
00:53:22,436 --> 00:53:23,603
喂
Hello?

919
00:53:23,604 --> 00:53:25,605
媽  天哪  昨天我一直
Mom! God, I've been trying

920
00:53:25,606 --> 00:53:28,233
想聯系你們呢
to get in touch with you guys for the past day.

921
00:53:28,234 --> 00:53:29,902
我被準假了
My furlough went through!

922
00:53:29,903 --> 00:53:30,986
帕波
Piper?

923
00:53:30,987 --> 00:53:34,239
我需要爸爸的車牌號  或者卡爾的
So, I need Daddy's license plate number or Cal's.

924
00:53:34,240 --> 00:53:36,742
誰會來  還要一套換洗衣物
Who's coming? And, uh, a change of clothes.

925
00:53:36,743 --> 00:53:38,911
-帕波  -換洗衣物
- Piper? - A change of clothes.

926
00:53:38,912 --> 00:53:42,073
叫萊瑞把藍色毛衣拿來  好像在波麗家
Um, tell Larry the blue sweater. I think it's at Polly's.

927
00:53:42,540 --> 00:53:44,075
奶奶走了
Grandmother's gone.

928
00:53:44,918 --> 00:53:46,827
她昨晚去世了
She passed last night.

929
00:53:57,555 --> 00:53:59,340
但我要出去了
But I'm getting out.

930
00:54:04,979 --> 00:54:06,180
親愛的
Honey?

931
00:54:07,023 --> 00:54:08,682
我錯過了
I missed it.

932
00:54:14,280 --> 00:54:15,689
我錯過了
I missed it.

933
00:54:19,786 --> 00:54:21,905
你的精神與她同在
You were there in spirit.

934
00:54:28,294 --> 00:54:29,703
帕波
Piper?

935
00:54:40,938 --> 00:54:42,429
什么事  喬
Yes, Joe?

936
00:54:43,768 --> 00:54:46,119
我昨天炒了費歇爾
I terminated Fischer yesterday.

937
00:54:46,591 --> 00:54:49,064
她要拿到這個月的薪水
She needs to get paid through the end of the month.

938
00:54:49,065 --> 00:54:51,149
你一定覺得很難受
That must've been hard for you.

939
00:54:51,150 --> 00:54:56,071
別說了  我們本來就人手不足  她有可取之處
Please don't start. We're already understaffed. She had value.

940
00:54:56,072 --> 00:54:58,691
你一定是這么認為的
I suppose you must've thought so.

941
00:54:59,951 --> 00:55:03,321
我們不會被告性騷擾吧
We're not gonna get stuck with a sexual harassment suit, are we?

942
00:55:04,998 --> 00:55:07,750
很好  至于人手問題
Good. As for the staffing issue,

943
00:55:07,751 --> 00:55:10,460
我明白找到高質量人員不容易
I understand it's hard to find quality people.

944
00:55:10,461 --> 00:55:11,918
在這個環境當中
