我的家人和朋友全都死了
Well, all my friends and family are dead,

560
00:28:30,230 --> 00:28:33,330
只有W利弗・奎恩活著  可他只是|ち

I think if Sara wants to stay and help that then we should.

你只愿意榱俗约旱募胰四rg冒U
Are you only willing to risk the timeline if it's your own family?

I think my life's complicated enough

750
00:39:19,550 --> 00:39:23,720
我承受不了其他事了
without throwing whatever this is into the mix.

如今我不得不承J
Of late I've discovered

775

我想是吧
I guess so.

782
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:13,920
吉迪恩  我看看
All right, Gideon, let's see if these repairs

783
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:16,040
R丁  雷和杰克斯是不是完全修好了
that Martin, Ray, and Jax made are up to scratch.

784
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:17,790
在我看  桑德斯小姐
As far as I can tell, Ms. Saunders

785

我已不知道我是哪人了
I don't know who my people are anymore.

791
00:41:36,810 --> 00:41:39,210
下一站去哪里  船L
So where to next, Captain?

792
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:40,330
@任彰涝谖的下一站
Well, the beauty of this mission is that

793
00:41:40,330 --> 00:41:43,740
不是哪里  而是哪一年
the real question is not where, but when.

794
00:41:43,950 --> 00:41:45,620
因此  我就在_S奇防不俜r
