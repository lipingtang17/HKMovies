13
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:06,210
In 2166, an immortal tyrant named Vandal Savage

14
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:08,840
conquered the world and murdered my wife and child.

15
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:11,590
I have assembled an elite team to hunt him throughout time

16
00:00:11,590 --> 00:00:13,240
and stop his rise to power.

17
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:15,170
Unfortunately, my plan is opposed

18
00:00:15,170 --> 00:00:17,400
by the body I'd sworn my allegiance to:

19
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:18,800
the Time Masters.

20
00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:20,990
In the future, my friends may not be heroes,

21
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:23,010
but if we succeed,

22
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:26,180
they will be remembered as legends.

23
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:30,100
Previously on "Legends of Tomorrow"...

24
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:32,500
We're in the Temporal Zone. I don't understand.

25
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:33,960
No one should be able to--

26
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:35,340
A scan of the vessel suggests

27
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:37,590
that it is the bounty hunter, Kronos.

28
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:42,510
A crash landing--

29
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:45,630
in both place and time.

30
00:00:57,810 --> 00:00:59,570
Gideon, camouflage the ship.

31
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:01,170
This doesn't look like the type of place

32
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:02,900
we want to linger out in the open.

33
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:08,960
That looks a lot like a Palmer Tech building,

34
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:11,340
but why does it have a Smoak logo on it?

35
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,980
Wait, this is Star City.

36
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:17,110
I thought you said the timeline was safe.

37
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:20,470
Yes, Star City was intact in 2016.

38
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:24,530
This--this is 2046.

39
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:29,630
Don't move!

40
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:31,290
Thank God.

41
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:33,060
I said don't move.

42
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:35,690
It's me.

43
00:01:36,490 --> 00:01:37,580
It's Sara.

44
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:39,320
Hey, Oliver, look.

45
00:01:39,370 --> 00:01:41,040
I know it's been a long time.

46
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,960
But don't you remember that Rip Hunter

47
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,700
recruited us to become legends?

48
00:01:47,290 --> 00:01:49,220
I never heard of any Legends.

49
00:01:56,110 --> 00:01:57,130
Get back!

50
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,490
This guy a friend of yours? I don't like him.

51
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:11,400
What are you doing?

52
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,000
It's called shooting back.

53
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,550
Can't be the Green Arrow.

54
00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:20,060
That's not Oliver Queen.

55
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:24,310
Sure dresses like him.

56
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,360
Shoots arrows like him.

57
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:30,110
Well, whoever he is, I don't plan on sticking around

58
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:32,030
to shish kebabbed by this dude.

59
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,420
Kid's right.

60
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:36,070
Let's stay behind and kill him.

61
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,310
We need you in charge of the ship.

65
00:02:55,530 --> 00:02:57,570
All right, Rip. Tell us the truth.

66
00:02:57,570 --> 00:02:59,920
You've all seen how the timeline is malleable--

67
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,600
in flux until it is set.

68
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:05,000
Well, this future is not set.

69
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,330
Remember when I told you it was dangerous

70
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:09,710
for any of you to know too much about your own futures?

71
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:12,730
Well, the events that you dread could very well come to be

72
00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:14,500
due to your actions to prevent them.

73
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:16,880
You know what I think? I think you think too much.

74
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:18,590
Believe me when I tell you that the best thing

75
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:20,250
for yourselves and for this mission

76
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:23,240
is to make the repairs to the Waverider here in 2046

77
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:25,060
then head back to your own time

78
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:27,990
and make sure that none of this ever comes to be.

79
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:33,730
Looks like the whole propulsion system's jacked.

80
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,470
How do you even know what we're looking at here?

81
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:37,870
Doesn't matter if it takes you down the road or through time.

82
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:39,420
An engine's still an engine.

83
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,980
How long will it take you to make repairs?

84
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:43,910
I'm not too sure, but it would go a lot faster

85
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:45,060
if I had some help.

86
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:46,740
Maybe Kendra could lend me a hand?

87
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:48,050
Enlist whoever is free to help,

88
00:03:48,050 --> 00:03:49,760
I have this to contend with.

89
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,520
This is the Neuromorphic Interface

90
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:53,220
for Gideon's logic and navigation matrix.

91
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:55,780
Without it, Gideon cannot function.

92
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:57,730
Well, that explains how we got stranded here in the future.

93
00:03:57,730 --> 00:03:58,590
Palmer Tech was working on

94
00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:00,480
a self-learning, Neuromorphic Cortex.

95
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,430
They surely would have gone to prototype by 2046.

96
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:03,940
We are going to need that prototype.

97
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:05,790
Ah, Palmer Tech is now Smoak Technologies,

98
00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:07,320
but, uh, I'm sure I can still get us in.

99
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:09,530
As I said, we must keep you and Ms. Lance

100
00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:10,770
separate from your future homes.

101
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:12,240
In any case, there's a reason

102
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,940
why I recruited individuals

103
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:16,690
adept at misappropriating others' property.

104
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:19,520
It's not money. It's not jewels.

105
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:21,550
It's not a valuable artifact.

106
00:04:21,550 --> 00:04:23,770
You're just lucky I'll steal anything right about now.

107
00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:26,210
- As I suspected. - We'll get your gizmo.

108
00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:28,710
You just get this bucket flying again.

109
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:31,060
- I'm coming with. - No, no you are not.

110
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:33,170
You're too emotionally connected to the city.

111
00:04:33,450 --> 00:04:35,560
- We've been over this. - I'm over you.

112
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:36,990
You got us on a mission

113
00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:38,880
to change the timeline for yourself.

114
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,200
And you won't even let us look at our futures?

115
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:43,980
Now, I know this city better than anyone else,

116
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:45,890
and you're gonna need me out there.

117
00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:49,070
So, either I'm coming with,

118
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:50,920
or we can find out if the Time Masters

119
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,600
are as good at teaching people to fight

120
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,250
as the League of Assassins.

121
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:03,160
So the rest of the team's on a field trip to Palmer Tech,

122
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,930
now Smoak Technologies.

123
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:07,190
Palmer Tech sounds better, right?

124
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:07,880
Be honest.

125
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:10,110
Honestly, they sound about the same.

126
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:11,860
Even assuming our compatriots return

127
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:13,420
with a Neuromorphic prototype,

128
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:16,110
we'll still need to prepare Gideon for the new device.

129
00:05:16,130 --> 00:05:18,980
And the engines could definitely use some loving.

130
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:20,960
Actually, I could use an extra pair of hands.

131
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,810
Well, Raymond, why don't you and Ms. Saunders

132
00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:23,950
continue repairing Gideon,

133
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:26,470
and I'll assist Jefferson with the engines?

134
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,790
This is just a potential future.

135
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:37,060
It doesn't matter if we kill anyone here, right?

136
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:39,740
Well, to avoid the risk of a paradox,

137
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:43,760
it's probably best to refrain from killing anyone.

138
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:46,190
I'm not gonna promise anything.

139
00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:50,260
My sister's apartment used to be over here.

140
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:51,360
I seem to remember something

141
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:54,130
about your father being a police captain.

142
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:57,990
- Your point? - Did one hell of a job.

143
00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:00,840
My father and everyone else

144
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:02,620
would never have let this happen...

145
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:05,500
unless they were all dead.

146
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:11,910
You really are pretty good at this.

147
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:15,230
Yeah, I was a shipyard welder in 1944.

148
00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:18,120
No way. A real life Rosie the Riveter?

150
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:22,000
Is there anything you can't manage

151
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,560
to put a positive spin on?

152
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:26,690
No, I got it: the DMV.

153
00:06:28,730 --> 00:06:30,900
So you do have a dark side.

154
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:32,250
You making fun of me?

155
00:06:32,450 --> 00:06:33,440
Little bit.

156
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:37,610
Doesn't mean I don't find your unwavering optimism...

157
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,390
enjoyable.

158
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:42,150
I find watching you weld enjoyable.

159
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:46,090
Dr. Palmer, in case you weren't aware,

160
00:06:46,090 --> 00:06:47,810
you are on an open channel,

161
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:49,480
and we can hear everything you're saying.

162
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,800
Is it too much to ask

163
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:53,180
for some professionalism around here, and--

164
00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:55,560
why am I getting so upset?

165
00:06:56,910 --> 00:06:58,160
One moment, please.

166
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:02,680
I'm not upset. You're upset.

167
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:03,630
No, I'm not.

168
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:06,060
My elevated blood pressure confirms that you are.

169
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:07,240
I'm just--

170
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:09,760
I'm just getting annoyed that those two

171
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:10,970
are talking instead of working.

172
00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:12,160
I mean...

173
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:16,100
- You like her. - Dude, you're being crazy.

174
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:17,970
You do remember that we share

175
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:19,400
a psychic connection.

176
00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:21,020
I can sense what you're feeling.

177
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:22,290
If that were true, then you would shut up.

178
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:24,760
Hey, it's no day at the beach for me, either.

179
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:25,950
Believe me.

180
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:27,580
Well, it doesn't matter,

181
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:29,360
'cause I don't stand a chance with her anyway.

182
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:31,130
Now, why would you say that?

183
00:07:31,130 --> 00:07:32,890
Because right now, my competition

184
00:07:32,890 --> 00:07:35,510
is a billionaire genius who built his own super-suit

185
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:37,730
and some other dude she's known for 4,000 years

186
00:07:37,730 --> 00:07:39,510
who she is destined to be with.

187
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:41,160
If I may offer one word of advice--

188
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,080
I really wish you wouldn't.

189
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:45,030
That word would be "Confidence."

190
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:49,080
You met my younger self.

191
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:51,900
I was quite the ladies' man.

192
00:07:52,970 --> 00:07:54,450
Put yourself out there.

193
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:57,070
Good things will happen.

194
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:03,770
Palmer Tech's just two blocks up this way.

195
00:08:04,170 --> 00:08:05,730
Or at least it used to be.

196
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:08,870
Take cover in there!

197
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:16,960
It's like World War III out there.

198
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,240
It's beautiful.

199
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:29,330
We need to find another route.

200
00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:49,060
Ms. Lance, don't. Sara!

201
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:50,130
Damn it!

202
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:52,540
You two--don't move. We'll be right back.

203
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:53,530
Right.

204
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:55,500
We're not gonna sit here, right?

205
00:08:55,650 --> 00:08:57,900
Imagine all the looting we can do in this chaos.

206
00:08:57,900 --> 00:09:00,260
Why don't we stretch our legs at that bank we passed

207
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:01,770
three blocks back?

208
00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:16,060
Drop your weapons, and hand over your wallets.

209
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:18,560
Wait, are you actually trying to mug us?

210
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,670
What is this, amateur hour?

211
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:22,580
If you don't do what my man says,

212
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:26,020
we're gonna crush you into the pavement like a couple of ants.

213
00:09:26,310 --> 00:09:27,300
Really?

214
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:30,200
What do you say we teach these fellas a lesson?

215
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,290
Yeah.

216
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:42,520
That's what you get when you don't follow directions.

217
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:45,210
Interesting. Hold this.

218
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:50,650
Second thoughts...

219
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:54,960
Where did you get that?

220
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:56,800
eBay.

221
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:04,100
Now, your boss will not be needing this.

222
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:09,590
Well, this has been fun,

223
00:10:09,590 --> 00:10:11,800
but I think it's time to leave.

224
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:13,060
Leave?

225
00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:15,680
Why would we leave?

226
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:24,880
Come on, sweetheart.

227
00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:38,580
Don't move.

228
00:10:40,970 --> 00:10:41,980
You--

229
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:44,140
you are persistent.

230
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:45,950
I saw you get shot point-blank.

231
00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:49,260
It's high-density Kevlar, now...who the hell are you?

232
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:51,280
- Who are you? - I'm the Green Arrow.

233
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:53,830
Oliver Queen is the Green Arrow.

234
00:10:55,330 --> 00:10:56,480
No, he's not.

235
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:58,490
Oliver Queen is dead.

236
00:11:03,410 --> 00:11:04,850
How did Oliver die?

237
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:07,420
I don't know. No one does.

238
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:08,840
No one's seen him since--

239
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:12,550
- well, since the Uprising. - Uprising?

240
00:11:12,650 --> 00:11:15,140
Is just what people called it when--

241
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:16,830
well, when all this happened.

242
00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:19,550
15 years ago, he brought an army with him.

243
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:22,370
- Who brought an army? - I did.

244
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,360
No, it's not possible.

245
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:39,250
How did you get off Lian Yu?

246
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:42,130
Say something, damn it!

247
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:45,940
Ms. Lance? Who is this?

248
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:47,700
Somebody very dangerous.

249
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:49,420
Then now is not the right time for me to say it--

250
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:52,010
but please, remind me later to tell you that I told you so.

251
00:11:52,010 --> 00:11:54,070
How are you still alive, Slade?

252
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:55,510
Slade.

253
00:11:57,830 --> 00:12:00,720
That's a name I haven't heard in a long time.

254
00:12:07,930 --> 00:12:09,350
How do you know my father?

255
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:12,040
He called you Ms. Lance.

256
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:16,360
Any relation to the late Captain Lance?

257
00:12:16,730 --> 00:12:19,300
If so, you must have heard stories about my father.

258
00:12:19,590 --> 00:12:21,050
I knew your father.

259
00:12:22,050 --> 00:12:23,470
He was insane.

260
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:26,000
Seems to run in the family.

261
00:12:27,430 --> 00:12:29,150
I'm going to enjoy killing you--

262
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:32,170
or we will.

263
00:12:37,930 --> 00:12:39,340
Okay, bad idea.

264
00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:41,420
Come on.

265
00:12:45,830 --> 00:12:46,990
All right.

266
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:49,230
Grey and I have got the mains back online.

267
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:50,320
Great.

268
00:12:50,430 --> 00:12:54,080
Ray's working on something called the quantum manifold.

269
00:12:55,590 --> 00:12:57,830
But I can't seem to get this to cooperate.

270
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,920
Let me give it a try.

271
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:06,050
Hey, you actually seem to know what you're doing here.

272
00:13:06,050 --> 00:13:08,310
Uh, yeah, machines are kind of my thing.

273
00:13:08,410 --> 00:13:10,240
Plus, I've been looking at the instruction manual

274
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:11,750
in my downtime, so...

275
00:13:11,930 --> 00:13:12,950
Most people can't follow

276
00:13:12,950 --> 00:13:14,520
the instructions to build their new bookcase,

277
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:16,700
and here you are working on a spaceship.

278
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:20,060
A time-traveling spaceship from the future, no less.

279
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:21,490
Well, when you put it like that,

280
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:23,060
I am kind of amazing.

281
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:24,670
And humble.

282
00:13:25,690 --> 00:13:28,970
Hey, if you ever have any bookcases need putting together--

283
00:13:28,970 --> 00:13:30,300
I'll know who to call.

284
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,070
So, Raymond,

285
00:13:37,070 --> 00:13:39,870
you were working with Kendra earlier.

286
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:41,600
I couldn't help but notice

287
00:13:41,610 --> 00:13:43,190
there might've been a little...

288
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:44,820
spark.

289
00:13:45,190 --> 00:13:47,220
- Really? - Oh, yes.

290
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:49,580
It was quite apparent and if I'm not mistaken,

291
00:13:49,590 --> 00:13:53,200
I've noticed her throwing one or two glances your way.

292
00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:56,860
Wow, that's-- that's surprising.

293
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:59,040
- Is it? - Well, yeah.

294
00:13:59,350 --> 00:14:02,300
I don't know, I hadn't really considered her in that way.

295
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:05,950
Why are you bringing this up?

296
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:08,760
Jeez, I feel like I'm back in high school.

297
00:14:09,130 --> 00:14:11,340
I honestly wouldn't know. I skipped 10th grade.

298
00:14:11,690 --> 00:14:12,860
And 11th.

299
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:14,700
I haven't really spent that much time with Kendra.

300
00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:17,580
You know, other than time that we shared with her

301
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:19,200
and her reincarnated soulmate,

302
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:21,370
or people trying to kill us.

303
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:26,050
All the more reason to avoid personal attachments.

304
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:29,860
This ship may be large, but our group is small.

305
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:32,760
Yeah.

306
00:14:32,890 --> 00:14:34,490
Preaching to the choir, Professor.

307
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:36,530
We're onboard the Waverider to save the world...

308
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,250
not hook up.

309
00:14:39,490 --> 00:14:41,690
Yes, quite right.

310
00:14:53,170 --> 00:14:55,850
Hey, you, I'm terrible with names.

311
00:14:55,850 --> 00:14:57,800
- I'm gonna call you Fonzie. - Yeah!

312
00:14:57,810 --> 00:14:59,930
- I'm gonna call you Kenickie. - Yeah!

313
00:14:59,930 --> 00:15:01,660
Anyone else here need a name?

314
00:15:01,690 --> 00:15:05,650
Your highness, can I get a moment of your time, please?

315
00:15:05,650 --> 00:15:06,780
Sure.

316
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:10,750
Isn't the future great?

317
00:15:10,930 --> 00:15:14,130
We really should be getting back to Rip and Sara.

318
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:14,930
Why?

319
00:15:14,930 --> 00:15:18,240
Cause I'm not looking to put down roots here.

320
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:21,020
Why not? It's everything we've ever wanted.

321
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:23,750
I got a gang that does everything I tell them to.

322
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:25,230
I got a fur coat.

323
00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:27,540
I got a chalice.

324
00:15:27,570 --> 00:15:28,860
Speaking of.

325
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:32,910
- What about stopping Savage? - What about it?

326
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,170
You're the one who said we're in

327
00:15:34,170 --> 00:15:36,040
this for the score, remember?

328
00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:38,310
We could live like kings here.

329
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:40,320
No cops, no heroes--

330
00:15:40,330 --> 00:15:42,430
just some fool in a green hoodie.

331
00:15:42,430 --> 00:15:44,140
It's Christmas every day.

332
00:15:45,690 --> 00:15:46,880
My sweet.

333
00:15:55,370 --> 00:15:56,880
Slade had a son?

334
00:15:58,650 --> 00:16:00,070
Look, Oliver tried.

335
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:03,010
He tried to raise an army to fight Deathstroke, but...

336
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:06,420
everyone just wanted to evacuate.

337
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:08,940
How can you save a city that doesn't want to be saved?

338
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:11,980
A moment.

339
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:13,300
Sara, I know what you must be thinking,

340
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:15,520
but none of what has transpired here is your fault,

341
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:17,530
nor do you have the means to change it,

342
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:20,660
but Vandal Savage's future is preventable.

343
00:16:21,270 --> 00:16:22,630
I implore you,

344
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:26,170
please stay focused on our mission.

345
00:16:29,310 --> 00:16:30,710
We're very grateful for your assistance,

346
00:16:30,710 --> 00:16:32,000
but we really must be moving along to Smoak Technologies.

347
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,050
What for?

348
00:16:34,310 --> 00:16:36,150
That place has been cleared out for years,

349
00:16:36,150 --> 00:16:39,130
but a lot of Felicity Smoak's projects got relocated.

350
00:16:39,310 --> 00:16:40,250
Where?

351
00:16:41,790 --> 00:16:42,700
Come on.

352
00:16:48,290 --> 00:16:51,420
You didn't say that Felicity's equipment would be here.

353
00:16:52,850 --> 00:16:54,960
Well, where else would you think it'd be?

354
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:13,840
Mr. Queen's base of operations

355
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:16,140
appears to have seen better days.

356
00:17:16,790 --> 00:17:18,130
Yeah, well...

357
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:20,720
the place got attacked after Grant Wilson

358
00:17:20,730 --> 00:17:22,500
outed Queen as the Green Arrow.

359
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:29,930
Let's just find what we're looking for and get out of here.

360
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:35,500
Whoever's there, get out.

361
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:37,790
I said get out!

362
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:41,480
Whoever you are, get out.

363
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:45,560
Oliver?

364
00:17:51,630 --> 00:17:52,830
Hello, Sara.

365
00:17:54,510 --> 00:17:56,050
Long time no see.

366
00:18:02,670 --> 00:18:04,820
- Is that-- - Oliver Queen.

367
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:08,920
Everyone thinks that you're dead.

368
00:18:08,930 --> 00:18:10,110
They're not wrong.

369
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:12,570
Put the arrow down, John.

370
00:18:12,570 --> 00:18:14,430
You're embarrassing yourself.

371
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:16,920
- John? - John Diggle Junior.

372
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:22,180
My dad is dead

373
00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:24,660
because I couldn't save him.

374
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:29,450
I don't deserve his name. I'm Connor Hawke.

375
00:18:29,450 --> 00:18:31,190
So you won't take his name,

376
00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:34,600
but it's all right to parade around in someone else's outfit?

377
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:36,010
Well, someone has to,

378
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:39,990
because last time that I checked, you were dead.

379
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:42,310
Everyone thought you were dead.

380
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:46,790
I've been trying to hold this city by myself

381
00:18:47,130 --> 00:18:48,900
because I thought you were gone.

382
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:56,590
What happened to you?

383
00:18:57,980 --> 00:18:59,980
To Laurel, to my dad...

384
00:19:00,690 --> 00:19:02,230
- Felicity-- - They're gone.

385
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:05,290
- All of them. - What do you mean?

386
00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:09,080
- Ollie-- - Gone.

387
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:11,880
What do you want me to say, Sara?

388
00:19:11,890 --> 00:19:15,310
30 years ago, you and Ray hopped on a spaceship,

389
00:19:16,770 --> 00:19:18,680
- and you never came back. - We will.

390
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:20,200
I don't want to say that...

391
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:22,850
things would have ended differently

392
00:19:22,850 --> 00:19:24,360
if you and Ray had been here, but--

393
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:26,730
But if we were, it could've made the difference.

394
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:31,420
You thought I was dead. What are you doing here?

395
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:33,980
We were looking for a Neuromorphic Prototype

396
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:35,860
that Felicity Smoak was working on.

397
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:38,930
Felicity left after everything that happened.

398
00:19:39,490 --> 00:19:41,100
Everything her company was working on

399
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:44,280
is being kept in a warehouse at Adams and O'Neil.

400
00:19:44,990 --> 00:19:48,000
- Entry code is 4-5-8-7. - Thank you, Mr.--

401
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,410
You found your way in...

402
00:19:50,510 --> 00:19:51,720
find your way out.

403
00:19:58,650 --> 00:20:01,280
I got to admit, that wasn't bad advice, Grey.

404
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:03,220
So things went well with Ms. Saunders?

405
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:04,220
Oh, yeah.

406
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:05,050
Well, I have more good news.

407
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:08,590
I was able to very subtly confirm

408
00:20:08,590 --> 00:20:11,050
that Raymond has no romantic inclinations

409
00:20:11,050 --> 00:20:13,650
towards your crush object.

410
00:20:13,650 --> 00:20:16,220
Okay, well, once we've sorted out my love life,

411
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:18,350
we need to update your vocabulary.

412
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:19,480
Can't wait.

413
00:20:19,850 --> 00:20:20,920
I'm gonna go check on Kendra.

414
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,880
- Hey-- confidence. - Yeah.

415
00:20:25,790 --> 00:20:27,690
I got the initial dampeners back online.

416
00:20:27,690 --> 00:20:28,710
On the rest of the team returns

417
00:20:28,710 --> 00:20:30,110
with the Neuromorphic Prototype,

418
00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:31,120
Gideon will be good to go.

419
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:32,230
Excellent.

420
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:33,800
Sooner we get out of here, the better.

421
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:36,350
- And thank you, by the way. - Whatever for?

422
00:20:36,350 --> 00:20:37,720
Well, till you mentioned it,

423
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:39,830
I hadn't really thought about Kendra in that way,

424
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:41,560
because, you know, she and Carter

425
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:43,960
were destined to be together in this lifetime,

426
00:20:44,030 --> 00:20:46,080
but it's all changed

427
00:20:46,330 --> 00:20:48,540
and, uh, you know, she's quirky

428
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:50,350
and funny and beautiful

429
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:52,420
and a pretty good welder.

430
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:53,700
So-- you know,

431
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:57,360
what about all those things we were talking about?

432
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:58,870
The mission and so forth?

433
00:20:58,870 --> 00:21:03,260
Oh, well, we're all adults here, right?

434
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:05,090
Getting to know each other a little bit better,

435
00:21:05,410 --> 00:21:07,290
it's not gonna stop us from saving the world.

436
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:10,100
Oh, boy.

437
00:21:22,970 --> 00:21:24,250
Who invited them?

438
00:21:24,810 --> 00:21:27,440
Word on the street is Deathstroke is pissed about something.

439
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:30,040
Deathstroke-- what kind of name's that?

440
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:36,470
Party's over. Everyone hit the streets.

441
00:21:36,470 --> 00:21:37,690
Hit everybody on them.

442
00:21:37,690 --> 00:21:39,810
I want Green Arrow dead by morning.

443
00:21:40,230 --> 00:21:42,940
Listen, pal, this is my gang.

444
00:21:42,950 --> 00:21:45,220
The only orders they take are from me.

445
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:48,800
Hmm, might be your gang, but it's my city.

446
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:54,530
Green Arrow is running with a female assassin in white

447
00:21:54,530 --> 00:21:56,590
and a Brit in a brown coat.

448
00:21:56,590 --> 00:21:57,630
Kill them all.

449
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:09,240
Heard the man. Let's go.

450
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:12,010
Looks like your new minions

451
00:22:12,010 --> 00:22:14,040
are about to go on a citywide manhunt

452
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:16,380
- for Rip and Sara. - So what?

453
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:18,460
They're gonna kill our friends.

454
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:20,630
Since when did they become our friends?

455
00:22:20,730 --> 00:22:21,610
You tell me.

456
00:22:21,610 --> 00:22:24,420
You and Raymond seemed to get pretty tight back in Russia.

457
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:25,870
I've never been tight with anyone.

458
00:22:25,870 --> 00:22:28,530
Mick, it's time to go.

459
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:32,510
- You're not the boss of me. - Actually, I am.

460
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:40,210
Okay, let's both take a deep breath.

461
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:43,390
And we'll make ourselves a deal.

462
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:45,330
You help me get to Rip and Sara.

463
00:22:45,330 --> 00:22:48,760
Once they're safe, we can have this conversation.

464
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:49,950
Fair?

466
00:23:00,350 --> 00:23:03,290
Thank you for agreeing to accompany us, Mr. Diggle.

467
00:23:03,970 --> 00:23:05,190
It's Connor.

468
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:08,680
It's not like I needed to stick around Oliver Queen for anything.

469
00:23:17,150 --> 00:23:19,270
- Did you know? - Know what?

470
00:23:19,790 --> 00:23:21,880
That this is what would happen in my city?

471
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:24,870
Oliver said that the only reason

472
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:25,990
that things got so bad

473
00:23:25,990 --> 00:23:27,760
is because Ray and I weren't there to help.

474
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:29,220
I suspected that might be the case,

475
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:31,860
but that's actually a good thing.

476
00:23:32,130 --> 00:23:34,330
Now, once our mission is complete

477
00:23:34,330 --> 00:23:37,460
and you and Dr. Palmer are returned to Star City in 2016,

478
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:40,760
you will both be present to stop Grant Wilson's Uprising.

479
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,920
This future is only a potential timeline.

480
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:46,380
So this-this version of Star City--

481
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:47,860
this doesn't have to happen?

482
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:49,960
Correct. The future is always in flux.

483
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:52,250
Hopefully, this will never come to pass.

484
00:23:54,450 --> 00:23:56,250
This world isn't real.

485
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,360
Let's split up. We'll cover more ground.

487
00:24:52,450 --> 00:24:54,130
Hello, beautiful.

488
00:25:14,410 --> 00:25:15,750
There's too many of them!

489
00:25:25,930 --> 00:25:28,080
Gentlemen, your timing is exemplary.

490
00:25:31,290 --> 00:25:32,660
Where's Connor?

491
00:25:42,190 --> 00:25:43,660
He's been taken.

492
00:25:48,110 --> 00:25:49,820
These are Grant Wilson's men.

493
00:25:51,790 --> 00:25:53,810
The guy with the half face and the body armor

494
00:25:53,810 --> 00:25:56,210
has a real mad-on for the kid in the hoodie.

495
00:25:57,890 --> 00:26:00,760
- Can I have a word? - Rip--

496
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:01,690
I know what you're going to say.

497
00:26:01,690 --> 00:26:03,620
- We have to get him back. - Yes, that.

498
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:04,850
You're forgetting this future

499
00:26:04,850 --> 00:26:06,230
is only a potential timeline.

500
00:26:06,230 --> 00:26:08,110
Yeah, where Grant Wilson kills Connor.

501
00:26:08,110 --> 00:26:09,320
Wilson's not going to murder Connor,

502
00:26:09,330 --> 00:26:11,160
because once you're returned to 2016,

503
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:13,890
there won't be a Wilson or a Connor,

504
00:26:14,070 --> 00:26:16,040
at least not as we know them both right now.

505
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:20,440
Now that we rescued them, let's have that chat.

506
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:23,120
You want to stay here.

507
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:24,510
Thought I made that pretty clear.

508
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:28,070
What I'm less clear on is why you don't.

509
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,290
A city of thieves and criminals--

510
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,180
Sounds like a lot of competition.

511
00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:33,430
Then we wipe them out.

512
00:26:33,620 --> 00:26:35,100
What I did to that other guy,

513
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:37,350
we do the same thing to this Grant Wilson

514
00:26:37,350 --> 00:26:39,810
and anyone else stupid enough to get in our way.

515
00:26:41,050 --> 00:26:42,740
Take a look around, Snart.

516
00:26:43,150 --> 00:26:44,600
We're living the dream.

517
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:47,520
Yeah. Speaking of which...

518
00:26:49,590 --> 00:26:51,240
Sleep tight, buddy.

519
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,230
What happened to him?

520
00:26:54,230 --> 00:26:55,860
Difference of opinion.

521
00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:56,910
Right.

522
00:26:57,190 --> 00:27:00,970
We need to get this and Mr. Rory back to the Waverider.

523
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:10,530
Oh, Jefferson, perfect timing.

524
00:27:10,530 --> 00:27:13,100
I'm in need of your mechanical acumen.

525
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:14,410
Okay, let's do it.

526
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:21,270
What? What did you do?

527
00:27:21,270 --> 00:27:22,580
I don't know what you're talking about.

528
00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:24,860
You did something. What did you do?

529
00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:26,160
Nothing, nothing.

530
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:28,670
You know, this psychic connection thing,

531
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:30,230
it goes both ways

532
00:27:30,230 --> 00:27:31,540
and the moment that I walked in here,

533
00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:34,040
I started feeling really anxious and guilty.

534
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:35,570
You feel guilty, so what did you do?

535
00:27:35,570 --> 00:27:37,430
In my defense, I was only acting in your best interests.

536
00:27:37,430 --> 00:27:38,320
What did you do?

537
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:40,410
It's possible in my attempt to discern

538
00:27:40,410 --> 00:27:43,100
whether Dr. Palmer had competing feelings for Ms. Saunders--

539
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:43,760
Oh, you didn't--

540
00:27:43,770 --> 00:27:45,790
I may have inadvertently prompted him

541
00:27:45,790 --> 00:27:47,970
to think of her in ways in which...

542
00:27:48,140 --> 00:27:49,230
he hadn't.

543
00:27:49,230 --> 00:27:50,720
- Ugh, Grey! - I'm sorry.

544
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:52,500
My intentions were honorable.

545
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:56,780
Ah, it's cool.

546
00:27:57,830 --> 00:27:59,820
- Is it? - Yeah.

547
00:28:00,050 --> 00:28:02,060
I mean, nothing's really changed apart from the fact

548
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:05,790
that now I got competition I didn't have before,

549
00:28:05,950 --> 00:28:09,130
but I should still have confidence in myself.

550
00:28:09,130 --> 00:28:10,190
Right?

551
00:28:11,470 --> 00:28:12,530
Right.

552
00:28:14,130 --> 00:28:15,070
Oh, they're back.

553
00:28:15,070 --> 00:28:16,230
Where's Mr. Rory?

554
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:18,640
Sleeping it off.

555
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,250
We have the Neuromorphic Prototype.

556
00:28:20,250 --> 00:28:21,850
Any luck with the ship's engines?

557
00:28:21,990 --> 00:28:23,120
Yeah, it's all good.

558
00:28:24,390 --> 00:28:26,290
Is there something wrong, Ms. Lance?

559
00:28:26,950 --> 00:28:30,190
Well, all my friends and family are dead,

560
00:28:30,230 --> 00:28:33,330
except for Oliver Queen, who happens to be dead inside

561
00:28:33,330 --> 00:28:34,600
and missing his left arm.

562
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:35,730
Sara, I have told you--

563
00:28:35,730 --> 00:28:38,120
That this is just a potential future

564
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:39,660
and that it's all gonna go back

565
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:41,830
when we return to 2016--

566
00:28:41,870 --> 00:28:43,930
if we return.

567
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:45,530
But what if we don't?

568
00:28:45,530 --> 00:28:47,670
We all know Carter's not coming back.

569
00:28:47,670 --> 00:28:49,900
It's not like we have the safest line of work.

570
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:54,110
I think if Sara wants to stay and help that then we should.

571
00:28:54,110 --> 00:28:56,840
I mean, that's what we signed up for: to be heroes.

572
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:58,000
I agree with Jefferson.

573
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,050
Yes, of course you both do,

574
00:28:59,050 --> 00:29:02,230
because neither of you understand the pitfalls of changing the timeline.

575
00:29:02,230 --> 00:29:04,940
Meddling with the future is arguably more dangerous

576
00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:07,580
than changing the past, because it is still in flux.

577
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:10,210
Your wife and son's death are in the future.

578
00:29:11,090 --> 00:29:15,040
- You want us to change that. - Don't play that card with me.

579
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:16,040
So what?

580
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:18,970
Are you only willing to risk the timeline if it's your own family?

581
00:29:18,970 --> 00:29:21,570
I am not just trying to save my family

582
00:29:21,570 --> 00:29:24,050
and I'm not just trying to save one city,

583
00:29:24,050 --> 00:29:25,580
but the entire world!

584
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:28,150
I'm not the one being selfish, Sara.

585
00:29:28,150 --> 00:29:29,340
Go to hell.

586
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:31,830
Most likely.

587
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:34,720
If you want to go and save Mr. Hawke,

588
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:35,910
then be my guest.

589
00:29:36,250 --> 00:29:37,780
I'll keep the ship here for one hour,

590
00:29:37,780 --> 00:29:38,900
then we're leaving.

591
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:40,480
With you on board or without.

592
00:29:47,260 --> 00:29:49,030
Hello, Mick.

593
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:50,310
You son of a bitch.

594
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:51,980
Just calm down.

595
00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:53,150
You lied to me!

596
00:29:54,650 --> 00:29:56,550
Wouldn't be the first time.

597
00:29:56,550 --> 00:29:58,870
Remember the Delray Currency Exchange?

598
00:29:58,870 --> 00:30:01,330
The Black Hawk Armored Car job?

599
00:30:01,450 --> 00:30:03,130
If I hadn't lied to you on those scores,

600
00:30:03,130 --> 00:30:05,590
we'd both be in prison or dead.

601
00:30:06,170 --> 00:30:08,330
I'm the brains. You're the muscle.

602
00:30:08,330 --> 00:30:10,350
That's how it's always been.

603
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:13,580
And on occasion, I've had to call some audibles.

604
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:17,120
You have a habit of getting in your own way, Mick.

605
00:30:17,750 --> 00:30:19,030
You're right.

606
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:20,930
You've lied to me about jobs before,

607
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:23,990
but then again, you lied to me about this being a job.

608
00:30:23,990 --> 00:30:26,030
It's not about the score anymore for you.

609
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:30,560
You'd rather save the world than be my partner.

610
00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:32,440
A real team player.

611
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:34,940
'Cause that's what it's gonna take to defeat Savage.

612
00:30:34,950 --> 00:30:38,220
Then what? More money? More power?

613
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:40,770
A life of leisure and sin?

614
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:42,190
Don't you get it, Mick?

615
00:30:42,190 --> 00:30:44,230
If we take out Savage, this immortal monster,

616
00:30:44,230 --> 00:30:45,570
can't you see what that gets us?

617
00:30:45,570 --> 00:30:47,260
No, tell me.

618
00:30:47,270 --> 00:30:50,910
We'd be the two baddest sons of bitches of all time.

619
00:30:50,910 --> 00:30:53,250
I don't want a ticker tape parade.

620
00:30:54,770 --> 00:30:57,040
You know what I want from this world.

621
00:30:58,280 --> 00:30:59,550
Yes...

622
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:02,170
to see it burn.

623
00:31:03,020 --> 00:31:04,850
You lay a hand on me again,

624
00:31:05,710 --> 00:31:07,390
you'll burn too.

625
00:31:12,550 --> 00:31:13,960
Oliver.

626
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:17,180
Oliver!

627
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:20,360
Thought I told you to go.

628
00:31:20,990 --> 00:31:22,710
Grant Wilson has Connor.

629
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:24,980
They're gonna kill him.

630
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:27,420
He knew what he was signing up for

631
00:31:27,670 --> 00:31:30,170
and you know there's nothing I can do to help him.

632
00:31:30,170 --> 00:31:32,370
That's not the Oliver Queen that I know.

633
00:31:32,370 --> 00:31:34,820
Maybe I'm not that person anymore.

634
00:31:35,540 --> 00:31:36,840
Look at me, Sara.

635
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:40,160
I'm literally half the man I used to be.

636
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:42,620
Then that's the half this city needs.

637
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:44,840
He's got too many men, Ollie.

638
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:47,430
I can't do this by myself.

639
00:31:47,630 --> 00:31:49,080
What about your friends?

640
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:50,320
I'm on my own--

641
00:31:51,210 --> 00:31:52,770
unless I'm not.

642
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:58,180
Come on, Sara.

643
00:31:58,180 --> 00:31:59,720
I never got the chance to ask Connor

644
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:02,550
why he wears the hood, but I know why.

645
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:06,400
It's because this city

646
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:08,820
will always need a Green Arrow.

647
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:21,630
Is the ship ready for departure?

648
00:32:21,630 --> 00:32:23,460
No, Ms. Lance is not yet onboard.

649
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:24,820
I gave her an hour.

650
00:32:25,050 --> 00:32:26,070
Hardly enough time for--

651
00:32:26,070 --> 00:32:27,240
And she's been 90 minutes.

652
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:28,990
How much longer are we supposed to wait?

653
00:32:30,020 --> 00:32:33,670
It doesn't matter that this is a potential future.

654
00:32:33,670 --> 00:32:35,330
It doesn't matter that this

655
00:32:35,330 --> 00:32:36,600
may never come to pass--

656
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:38,030
may never be real.

657
00:32:38,030 --> 00:32:40,630
For Sara, this is very real.

658
00:32:40,630 --> 00:32:43,110
I know, which is why I gave her an extra 30 minutes.

659
00:32:43,110 --> 00:32:44,350
Gideon, what's our status?

660
00:32:44,350 --> 00:32:46,170
The Waverider is operational, Captain,

661
00:32:46,170 --> 00:32:47,570
but I can't guarantee for how long.

662
00:32:47,570 --> 00:32:49,150
- Explain. - We are cloaked,

663
00:32:49,150 --> 00:32:52,090
but positioned dangerously close to where the city's criminal element

664
00:32:52,090 --> 00:32:54,610
is gathering to witness the execution of Connor Hawke.

665
00:32:54,610 --> 00:32:56,200
The longer we wait, the greater the risk

666
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:58,620
of detection and further damage to the ship.

667
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,240
Do you really want to risk

668
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:02,750
being marooned in this version of 2046 forever?

669
00:33:02,750 --> 00:33:05,710
Certainly more than I want to maroon Sara here.

670
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:08,740
She's our friend. Our teammate.

671
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:12,370
What's the point of stopping Savage

672
00:33:12,370 --> 00:33:16,070
if we only become as immoral as he is in the process?

673
00:33:35,490 --> 00:33:36,730
You should be honored.

674
00:33:37,110 --> 00:33:38,910
This is hallowed ground.

675
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:40,880
I took Oliver Queen's arm

676
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:43,350
in this very spot.

677
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:46,940
Well, then let me go,

678
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:49,020
and we'll see which one of us is tougher,

679
00:33:49,430 --> 00:33:50,450
me or Queen.

680
00:33:50,450 --> 00:33:52,650
I already know the answer to that.

681
00:33:52,930 --> 00:33:54,240
Ready the prisoner.

682
00:34:01,180 --> 00:34:02,030
Sir.

683
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:10,240
We saw her trying to sneak past the perimeter.

684
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:11,580
Sloppy.

685
00:34:12,290 --> 00:34:15,020
The League of Assassins would be embarrassed.

686
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:16,650
What was your strategy here?

687
00:34:16,890 --> 00:34:19,180
You really think you could just turn up tonight...

688
00:34:20,790 --> 00:34:21,820
kill me?

689
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:24,540
No.

690
00:34:25,390 --> 00:34:27,880
It was just my job to distract you.

691
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:02,230
You're not Green Arrow.

692
00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:04,500
You're just a punk in a Halloween costume.

693
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:07,360
Funny, I was gonna say the same thing about you.

694
00:35:34,250 --> 00:35:36,070
You want to fight the Green Arrow?

695
00:35:36,670 --> 00:35:37,940
I'm right here.

696
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:58,070
How did you convince Rip to stay?

697
00:35:58,070 --> 00:36:00,320
Actually, sending in the cavalry was his idea.

698
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:11,160
Where's Mr. Queen?

699
00:36:16,290 --> 00:36:17,350
Connor!

700
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:41,770
Cowards, all!

701
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:47,530
Oliver?

702
00:36:47,530 --> 00:36:50,570
It's good to see you again, Ray. Kendra.

703
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:53,040
Thanks for the assist.

704
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:55,010
So who's that?

705
00:36:55,010 --> 00:36:56,960
His name is Grant Wilson.

706
00:36:57,600 --> 00:37:00,030
Once upon a time, his father, Slade,

707
00:37:00,030 --> 00:37:01,760
tried to ruin my life.

708
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:03,360
That's not a nice family.

709
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:07,030
That's good shooting, John.

710
00:37:12,650 --> 00:37:14,090
It's Connor.

711
00:37:15,530 --> 00:37:16,870
Either way,

712
00:37:17,740 --> 00:37:19,380
it's Green Arrow.

713
00:37:29,230 --> 00:37:30,720
We have a lot of work to do.

714
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:33,060
Grant Wilson did a good job

715
00:37:33,060 --> 00:37:35,880
of keeping the criminal element in the city together.

716
00:37:36,070 --> 00:37:39,190
Now, there will be plenty of people to fill the vacuum.

717
00:37:39,410 --> 00:37:41,170
I feel like I should stay.

718
00:37:41,170 --> 00:37:42,260
Before Ray left,

719
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:44,540
he told me why Rip brought all of you together.

720
00:37:44,830 --> 00:37:46,590
It's important, Sara.

721
00:37:46,590 --> 00:37:47,750
I just hate the idea

722
00:37:47,750 --> 00:37:49,900
of leaving you here to fix it alone.

723
00:37:50,110 --> 00:37:51,440
I'm not alone.

724
00:37:57,340 --> 00:37:59,690
Just--just be careful, all right?

725
00:37:59,770 --> 00:38:01,970
Well, you should know better than most

726
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:03,740
I rarely ever am.

727
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:15,190
You watch his back.

728
00:38:16,810 --> 00:38:18,340
Copy that.

729
00:38:20,110 --> 00:38:21,450
Let's get to work.

730
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:33,220
All right, confidence.

731
00:38:33,590 --> 00:38:35,270
Confidence. Okay.

732
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:38,570
So, uh, I think Rip might have

733
00:38:38,570 --> 00:38:40,740
some of that vodka left in his cabinet.

734
00:38:41,070 --> 00:38:42,090
And?

735
00:38:43,030 --> 00:38:44,150
And...

736
00:38:46,060 --> 00:38:47,460
maybe we could get a drink?

737
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:49,310
Are you asking me out?

738
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:52,840
Yes? No. I think so.

739
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:54,780
Is that okay?

740
00:38:54,780 --> 00:38:58,120
Yeah, that-- that's totally okay,

741
00:38:58,590 --> 00:39:00,860
except that three months ago,

742
00:39:00,860 --> 00:39:02,400
I was a completely normal person

743
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:05,550
and now I'm a hawk goddess

744
00:39:05,550 --> 00:39:06,980
traveling through time,

745
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:09,530
trying to avoid being killed by an immortal psychopath

746
00:39:09,530 --> 00:39:13,360
who murdered the man I was destined to be with.

747
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:14,420
So...

748
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:16,760
I'm sorry, Ray. I--

749
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:19,550
I think my life's complicated enough

750
00:39:19,550 --> 00:39:23,720
without throwing whatever this is into the mix.

751
00:39:25,990 --> 00:39:28,510
Yeah, totally understand.

752
00:39:29,270 --> 00:39:32,140
If I was a reincarnated Egyptian priestess,

753
00:39:32,140 --> 00:39:33,630
I'd probably feel the same way.

754
00:39:36,910 --> 00:39:38,620
I'm gonna go check on Professor Stein.

755
00:39:44,550 --> 00:39:46,050
All good here.

756
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:49,390
- Absolutely no problems. - Everything okay here?

757
00:39:49,390 --> 00:39:52,410
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, fine. You?

758
00:39:52,410 --> 00:39:54,710
Oh, yeah, good. Good. It's good.

759
00:39:57,720 --> 00:39:59,150
How much of that did you hear?

760
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:02,470
Uh, enough. I'm sorry.

761
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:04,040
Sorry too.

762
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:07,020
Wait, you knew that I--

763
00:40:08,370 --> 00:40:09,440
You're not that subtle.

764
00:40:11,610 --> 00:40:13,280
She would've picked me, by the way.

765
00:40:13,430 --> 00:40:14,820
Keep telling yourself that.

766
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:17,650
She would've.

767
00:40:23,370 --> 00:40:25,740
I'm just working on determining our next destination.

768
00:40:25,740 --> 00:40:27,380
I've considered your suggesting of hell,

769
00:40:27,380 --> 00:40:29,470
but I think I'll give it a miss for the time being.

770
00:40:31,020 --> 00:40:33,070
I ju st wanted to say thank you

771
00:40:34,410 --> 00:40:36,390
for sending the team to back me up.

772
00:40:37,930 --> 00:40:39,850
As it turns out, you were right.

773
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:42,350
That must've been hard to say.

774
00:40:43,570 --> 00:40:44,910
Of late I've discovered

775
00:40:44,910 --> 00:40:47,370
that I still have a lot to learn, I admit.

776
00:40:49,890 --> 00:40:52,720
Including the fact that every future is worth fighting for.

777
00:40:56,070 --> 00:40:57,440
That said...

778
00:40:58,070 --> 00:40:59,700
this mission is going to continue

779
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:01,630
to present us with difficult choices,

780
00:41:01,630 --> 00:41:04,720
and I need to know that you are a member of this team.

781
00:41:05,790 --> 00:41:07,020
I guess so.

782
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:13,920
All right, Gideon, let's see if these repairs

783
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:16,040
that Martin, Ray, and Jax made are up to scratch.

784
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:17,790
As far as I can tell, Ms. Saunders

785
00:41:17,790 --> 00:41:19,510
did most of the work, while the two gentlemen

786
00:41:19,510 --> 00:41:20,850
- competed for-- - Just get us out of here.

787
00:41:20,860 --> 00:41:22,220
Please, Gideon.

788
00:41:27,270 --> 00:41:29,400
I'm gonna miss this place.

789
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:32,670
Yeah, they really seemed like your kind of people.

790
00:41:33,420 --> 00:41:35,590
I don't know who my people are anymore.

791
00:41:36,810 --> 00:41:39,210
So where to next, Captain?

792
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:40,330
Well, the beauty of this mission is that

793
00:41:40,330 --> 00:41:43,740
the real question is not where, but when.

794
00:41:43,950 --> 00:41:45,620
In which case, I suggest that we next hit

795
00:41:45,630 --> 00:41:47,930
Savage when he least expects it.

800
00:09:36,510 --> 00:10:16,630
