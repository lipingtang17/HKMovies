00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:06,210
2166年  永生的暴君汪达尔・萨维奇
In 2166, an immortal tyrant named Vandal Savage

14
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:08,840
征服了世界  杀害了我的妻儿
conquered the world and murdered my wife and child.

15
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:11,590
我招募了一个精英团队  穿越时间去寻找他
I have assembled an elite team to hunt him throughout time

16
00:00:11,590 --> 00:00:13,240
并阻止他取得霸权
and stop his rise to power.

17
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:15,170
不幸的是  我的计划遭到
Unfortunately, my plan is opposed

18
00:00:15,170 --> 00:00:17,400
我曾发誓效忠的组织
by the body I'd sworn my allegiance to:

19
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:18,800
时间之主的反对
the Time Masters.

20
00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:20,990
未来  我的朋友们或许不是英雄
In the future, my friends may not be heroes,

21
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:23,010
但倘若此举成功
but if we succeed,

22
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:26,180
他们将会成为传奇  被世人铭记
they will be remembered as legends.

23
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:30,100
《明日传奇》前情提要
Previously on "Legends of Tomorrow"...

24
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:32,500
我们停在时光穿梭区  我不明白
We're in the Temporal Zone. I don't understand.

25
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:33,960
应该没人能...
No one should be able to--

26
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:35,340
船体的扫描结果显示
A scan of the vessel suggests

27
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:37,590
是赏金猎手克罗诺斯在袭击我们
that it is the bounty hunter, Kronos.

28
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:42,510
无法决定
A crash landing--

29
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:45,630
迫降的地点和时间
in both place and time.

30
00:00:57,810 --> 00:00:59,570
吉迪恩  把船伪装起来
Gideon, camouflage the ship.

31
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:01,170
这里不会是我们
This doesn't look like the type of place

32
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:02,900
想在外逗留很久的地方
we want to linger out in the open.

33
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:08,960
那栋挺像帕尔默科技大楼
That looks a lot like a Palmer Tech building,

34
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:11,340
但为什么是斯莫克的标志
but why does it have a Smoak logo on it?

35
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,980
等下  这里是星城
Wait, this is Star City.

36
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:17,110
你不是说时间线安全了吗
I thought you said the timeline was safe.

37
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:20,470
星城在2016年没有毁坏
Yes, Star City was intact in 2016.

38
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:24,530
但这是...这是2046年
This--this is 2046.

39
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:29,630
不许动
Don't move!

40
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:31,290
谢天谢地
Thank God.

41
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:33,060
我说了不许动
I said don't move.

42
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:35,690
是我
It's me.

43
00:01:36,490 --> 00:01:37,580
我是莎拉
It's Sara.

44
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:39,320
奥利弗
Hey, Oliver, look.

45
00:01:39,370 --> 00:01:41,040
我知道有段时间了
I know it's been a long time.

46
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,960
你是不是忘记
But don't you remember that Rip Hunter

47
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,700
我们被里普・亨特招募去当传奇了
recruited us to become legends?

48
00:01:47,290 --> 00:01:49,220
我从来没听过任何传奇
I never heard of any Legends.

49
00:01:56,110 --> 00:01:57,130
退后
Get back!

50
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,490
这是你朋友吗  我不喜欢他
This guy a friend of yours? I don't like him.

51
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:11,400
你在干什么
What are you doing?

52
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,000
这叫还击
It's called shooting back.

53
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,550
不可能是绿箭侠
Can't be the Green Arrow.

54
00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:20,060
他不是奥利弗・奎恩
That's not Oliver Queen.

55
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:24,310
可穿得很像他
Sure dresses like him.

56
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,360
射箭也像他
Shoots arrows like him.

57
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:30,110
不管他是谁  我可不想留在这里
Well, whoever he is, I don't plan on sticking around

58
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:32,030
被这哥们儿串成肉串
to shish kebabbed by this dude.

59
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,420
小兄弟说得对
Kid's right.

60
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:36,070
那咱们就在这干掉他
Let's stay behind and kill him.

61
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,310
你去控制飞船
We need you in charge of the ship.

好了  里普  说实话吧
All right, Rip. Tell us the truth.

66
00:02:57,570 --> 00:02:59,920
你们都看到时间线固定前
You've all seen how the timeline is malleable--

67
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,600
是如何延展变化的
in flux until it is set.

68
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:05,000
这个未来还没固定
Well, this future is not set.

69
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,330
还记得我说过你们对自己的未来
Remember when I told you it was dangerous

70
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:09,710
知道太多是非常危险的
for any of you to know too much about your own futures?

71
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:12,730
你害怕发生的事极有可能
Well, the events that you dread could very well come to be

72
00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:14,500
因为你去阻止而成为现实
due to your actions to prevent them.

73
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:16,880
知道我怎么想吗  我认为你想太多了
You know what I think? I think you think too much.

74
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:18,590
我得说  为了你们自己和这项任务
Believe me when I tell you that the best thing

75
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:20,250
现在当务之急
for yourselves and for this mission

76
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:23,240
你们要在2046年把乘波号修好
is to make the repairs to the Waverider here in 2046

77
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:25,060
然后回到你们的年代
then head back to your own time

78
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:27,990
确保这些永远不会发生
and make sure that none of this ever comes to be.

79
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:33,730
看来整个推进系统都坏掉了
Looks like the whole propulsion system's jacked.

80
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,470
你怎么知道我们要在这里检查什么
How do you even know what we're looking at here?

81
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:37,870
只要肯费时间  其他就不重要了
Doesn't matter if it takes you down the road or through time.

82
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:39,420
引擎总归是引擎
An engine's still an engine.

83
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,980
要花多久才能修好
How long will it take you to make repairs?

84
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:43,910
不确定  要是有人帮忙
I'm not too sure, but it would go a lot faster

85
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:45,060
我会快一点
if I had some help.

86
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:46,740
肯德拉或许能帮我的忙
Maybe Kendra could lend me a hand?

87
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:48,050
谁有空就找谁帮忙吧
Enlist whoever is free to help,

88
00:03:48,050 --> 00:03:49,760
我得处理这个
I have this to contend with.

89
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,520
这是吉迪恩逻辑和导航模型的
This is the Neuromorphic Interface

90
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:53,220
神经形态接口
for Gideon's logic and navigation matrix.

91
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:55,780
吉迪恩没了这个就无法工作
Without it, Gideon cannot function.

92
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:57,730
难怪我们会被困在未来
Well, that explains how we got stranded here in the future.

93
00:03:57,730 --> 00:03:58,590
帕尔默科技当时在研究
Palmer Tech was working on

94
00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:00,480
有自主学习功能的神经形态皮质
a self-learning, Neuromorphic Cortex.

95
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,430
到2046年他们肯定已经造出原型了
They surely would have gone to prototype by 2046.

96
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:03,940
我们需要那个原型
We are going to need that prototype.

97
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:05,790
帕尔默科技现在成了斯莫克科技
Ah, Palmer Tech is now Smoak Technologies,

98
00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:07,320
不过我还是能带大家进去
but, uh, I'm sure I can still get us in.

99
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:09,530
我说过  你和兰斯小姐
As I said, we must keep you and Ms. Lance

100
00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:10,770
不能接触你们未来的家园
separate from your future homes.

101
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:12,240
总之  我招募这些
In any case, there's a reason

102
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,940
擅长偷盗他人财产的人
why I recruited individuals

103
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:16,690
是有原因的
adept at misappropriating others' property.

104
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:19,520
不是钱财  不是珠宝
It's not money. It's not jewels.

105
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:21,550
也不是什么珍贵文物
It's not a valuable artifact.

106
00:04:21,550 --> 00:04:23,770
你就庆幸我现在什么都肯偷吧
You're just lucky I'll steal anything right about now.

107
00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:26,210
-如我所料  -我们会拿到你要的玩意
- As I suspected. - We'll get your gizmo.

108
00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:28,710
你只管让这铁桶飞起来就行
You just get this bucket flying again.

109
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:31,060
-我也去  -不  你不能去
- I'm coming with. - No, no you are not.

110
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:33,170
你和这座城市有太多的羁绊
You're too emotionally connected to the city.

111
00:04:33,450 --> 00:04:35,560
-我们谈过这个了 -我受够你了
- We've been over this. - I'm over you.

112
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:36,990
你让我们为了你
You got us on a mission

113
00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:38,880
执行改变时间线的任务
to change the timeline for yourself.

114
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,200
却不让我们看看自己的未来
And you won't even let us look at our futures?

115
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:43,980
我比任何人都了解这座城市
Now, I know this city better than anyone else,

116
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:45,890
你们需要我的帮忙
and you're gonna need me out there.

117
00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:49,070
所以  要么我也一起去
So, either I'm coming with,

118
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:50,920
要么就看看在教人打架方面
or we can find out if the Time Masters

119
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,600
是时间之主厉害
are as good at teaching people to fight

120
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,250
还是刺客联盟厉害
as the League of Assassins.

121
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:03,160
其他队友去以前的帕尔默科技
So the rest of the team's on a field trip to Palmer Tech,

122
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,930
现在的斯莫克科技出勤了
now Smoak Technologies.

123
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:07,190
帕尔默科技比较好听  对吧
Palmer Tech sounds better, right?

124
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:07,880
跟我说实话
Be honest.

125
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:10,110
实际上  听起来都一样
Honestly, they sound about the same.

126
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:11,860
就算我们的队友能拿回来
Even assuming our compatriots return

127
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:13,420
那个神经形态原型
with a Neuromorphic prototype,

128
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:16,110
我们也需要让吉迪恩适应新装备
we'll still need to prepare Gideon for the new device.

129
00:05:16,130 --> 00:05:18,980
而且引擎也急需修理
And the engines could definitely use some loving.

130
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:20,960
实际上  我需要一个帮手
Actually, I could use an extra pair of hands.

131
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,810
雷蒙德  要不然你和桑德斯小姐
Well, Raymond, why don't you and Ms. Saunders

132
00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:23,950
继续修理吉迪恩
continue repairing Gideon,

133
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:26,470
然后我去帮杰佛逊修引擎
and I'll assist Jefferson with the engines?

134
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,790
这个未来还没固定
This is just a potential future.

135
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:37,060
我们杀几个人没什么关系  对吧
It doesn't matter if we kill anyone here, right?

136
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:39,740
为了避免产生时间悖论的危险
Well, to avoid the risk of a paradox,

137
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:43,760
也许我们还是不杀人比较合适
it's probably best to refrain from killing anyone.

138
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:46,190
我可不能保证什么
I'm not gonna promise anything.

139
00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:50,260
我姐姐的公寓之前在这边
My sister's apartment used to be over here.

140
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:51,360
我好像记得
I seem to remember something

141
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:54,130
你爸爸是警察队长吧
about your father being a police captain.

142
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:57,990
-什么意思  -没把工作做好啊
- Your point? - Did one hell of a job.

143
00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:00,840
我爸爸和其他人
My father and everyone else

144
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:02,620
绝不会让这一切发生的
would never have let this happen...

145
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:05,500
除非他们都死了
unless they were all dead.

146
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:11,910
你还真挺擅长这个
You really are pretty good at this.

147
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:15,230
没错  我在1944年是个船坞焊工
Yeah, I was a shipyard welder in 1944.

148
00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:18,120
不会吧  你是现实版铆钉女工萝西
No way. A real life Rosie the Riveter?

149
00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:18,120
{\an8}{\pos(78.92,7.707)}「二战时期  男性大多参战
美国工厂大量职位空缺
铆钉女工萝西
是激励百万女性投入工作
的著名海报形象」

150
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:22,000
任何事你都能
Is there anything you can't manage

151
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,560
往正面方向想吗
to put a positive spin on?

152
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:26,690
我想到了  车管局
No, I got it: the DMV.

153
00:06:28,730 --> 00:06:30,900
所以你还真有黑暗的一面
So you do have a dark side.

154
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:32,250
你在取笑我吗
You making fun of me?

155
00:06:32,450 --> 00:06:33,440
有点吧
Little bit.

156
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:37,610
我觉得你一直这么乐观
Doesn't mean I don't find your unwavering optimism...

157
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,390
挺可爱的
enjoyable.

158
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:42,150
我觉得看你焊接也挺可爱
I find watching you weld enjoyable.

159
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:46,090
帕尔默博士  提醒你一下
Dr. Palmer, in case you weren't aware,

160
00:06:46,090 --> 00:06:47,810
你们现在正在公放
you are on an open channel,

161
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:49,480
你们说的话我们都能听见
and we can hear everything you're saying.

162
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,800
让大家专业点工作
Is it too much to ask

163
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:53,180
这个要求太过分了吗
for some professionalism around here, and--

164
00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:55,560
我为什么这么生气
why am I getting so upset?

165
00:06:56,910 --> 00:06:58,160
稍等片刻
One moment, please.

166
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:02,680
我并没有生气  是你生气了
I'm not upset. You're upset.

167
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:03,630
我没有
No, I'm not.

168
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:06,060
我的血压飙升  证明你有
My elevated blood pressure confirms that you are.

169
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:07,240
我只是
I'm just--

170
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:09,760
我只是很烦那两个人
I'm just getting annoyed that those two

171
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:10,970
光说话不干活
are talking instead of working.

172
00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:12,160
我是说
I mean...

173
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:16,100
-你喜欢她  -老兄  你疯了
- You like her. - Dude, you're being crazy.

174
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:17,970
你记得我们俩是
You do remember that we share

175
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:19,400
心灵相通的吧
a psychic connection.

176
00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:21,020
我能感觉到你的情感
I can sense what you're feeling.

177
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:22,290
要是这样  你就闭嘴吧
If that were true, then you would shut up.

178
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:24,760
我现在也不轻松
Hey, it's no day at the beach for me, either.

179
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:25,950
相信我
Believe me.

180
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:27,580
没关系
Well, it doesn't matter,

181
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:29,360
反正我和她不可能
'cause I don't stand a chance with her anyway.

182
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:31,130
为什么要那么说
Now, why would you say that?

183
00:07:31,130 --> 00:07:32,890
因为此时此刻  我的情敌是
Because right now, my competition

184
00:07:32,890 --> 00:07:35,510
给自己造了超级战衣的亿万富豪天才
is a billionaire genius who built his own super-suit

185
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:37,730
和一个她相识了四千年
and some other dude she's known for 4,000 years

186
00:07:37,730 --> 00:07:39,510
命中注定会在一起的家伙
who she is destined to be with.

187
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:41,160
我想给你提一点建议
If I may offer one word of advice--

188
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,080
你还是别提了
I really wish you wouldn't.

189
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:45,030
我想你"自信点"
That word would be "Confidence."

190
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:49,080
你见过年轻时候的我
You met my younger self.

191
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:51,900
我当时可是很有女人缘的
I was quite the ladies' man.

192
00:07:52,970 --> 00:07:54,450
好好表现自己
Put yourself out there.

193
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:57,070
会有好结果的
Good things will happen.

194
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:03,770
从这边走两个街区就是帕尔默科技了
Palmer Tech's just two blocks up this way.

195
00:08:04,170 --> 00:08:05,730
或者说至少以前在那里
Or at least it used to be.

196
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:08,870
快去那边找掩护
Take cover in there!

197
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:16,960
外面简直像第三次世界大战
It's like World War III out there.

198
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,240
太美妙了
It's beautiful.

199
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:29,330
很快回来
We need to find another route.

200
00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:49,060
兰斯小姐  别去  莎拉
Ms. Lance, don't. Sara!

201
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:50,130
该死的
Damn it!

202
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:52,540
你们俩呆着别动  我们去去就回
You two--don't move. We'll be right back.

203
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:53,530
好的
Right.

204
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:55,500
我们不会就待在这吧
We're not gonna sit here, right?

205
00:08:55,650 --> 00:08:57,900
想想我们能趁乱劫走的宝贝
Imagine all the looting we can do in this chaos.

206
00:08:57,900 --> 00:09:00,260
我们何不去往回走三个街区的银行
Why don't we stretch our legs at that bank we passed

207
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:01,770
活动下筋骨
three blocks back?

208
00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:16,060
放下武器  把钱包交出来
Drop your weapons, and hand over your wallets.

209
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:18,560
等等  你真的准备抢劫我们吗
Wait, are you actually trying to mug us?

210
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,670
这算什么  外行当道吗
What is this, amateur hour?

211
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:22,580
你们如果不按我手下说的做
If you don't do what my man says,

212
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:26,020
我们只能把你们当蚂蚁一样踩扁了
we're gonna crush you into the pavement like a couple of ants.

213
00:09:26,310 --> 00:09:27,300
搞笑吗
Really?

214
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:30,200
要不我们给这些人好好上一课吧
What do you say we teach these fellas a lesson?

215
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,290
好啊
Yeah.

216
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:42,520
这就是你不听话的下场
That's what you get when you don't follow directions.

217
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:45,210
有意思  帮我拿一下
Interesting. Hold this.

218
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:50,650
不如这样
Second thoughts...

219
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:54,960
你从哪弄来这玩意儿的
Where did you get that?

220
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:56,800
易趣
eBay.

221
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:04,100
你们老大现在用不着这个了
Now, your boss will not be needing this.

222
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:09,590
这确实很好玩
Well, this has been fun,

223
00:10:09,590 --> 00:10:11,800
但我们该走了
but I think it's time to leave.

224
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:13,060
走
Leave?

225
00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:15,680
我们为什么要走
Why would we leave?

226
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:24,880
来吧  甜心
Come on, sweetheart.

227
00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:38,580
站住别动
Don't move.

228
00:10:40,970 --> 00:10:41,980
你
You--

229
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:44,140
你还真是执着
you are persistent.

230
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:45,950
我看到你近距离挨了一枪
I saw you get shot point-blank.

231
00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:49,260
这是高密度凯芙拉纤维  你到底是谁
It's high-density Kevlar, now...who the hell are you?

232
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:51,280
-你是谁  -我是绿箭侠
- Who are you? - I'm the Green Arrow.

233
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:53,830
奥利弗・奎恩才是绿箭侠
Oliver Queen is the Green Arrow.

234
00:10:55,330 --> 00:10:56,480
不  他不是
No, he's not.

235
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:58,490
奥利弗・奎恩死了
Oliver Queen is dead.

236
00:11:03,410 --> 00:11:04,850
奥利弗怎么死的
How did Oliver die?

237
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:07,420
我也不清楚  没人知道
I don't know. No one does.

238
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:08,840
自从大起义之后
No one's seen him since--

239
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:12,550
-就没人见过他了  -大起义
- well, since the Uprising. - Uprising?

240
00:11:12,650 --> 00:11:15,140
大起义是人们给发生的
Is just what people called it when--

241
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:16,830
这一切所取的名字
well, when all this happened.

242
00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:19,550
15年前  他率领着一支大军
15 years ago, he brought an army with him.

243
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:22,370
-谁率领着一支大军  -我
- Who brought an army? - I did.

244
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,360
不  这不可能
No, it's not possible.

245
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:39,250
你怎么从炼狱岛逃出来的
How did you get off Lian Yu?

246
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:42,130
该死的  说话阿
Say something, damn it!

247
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:45,940
兰斯小姐  这是谁
Ms. Lance? Who is this?

248
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:47,700
一个很危险的人
Somebody very dangerous.

249
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:49,420
虽然现在不该这么说
Then now is not the right time for me to say it--

250
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:52,010
但等下请提醒我告诉你我早说过了
but please, remind me later to tell you that I told you so.

251
00:11:52,010 --> 00:11:54,070
斯莱德  你怎么还活着
How are you still alive, Slade?

252
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:55,510
斯莱德
Slade.

253
00:11:57,830 --> 00:12:00,720
很久没听人说这个名字了
That's a name I haven't heard in a long time.

254
00:12:07,930 --> 00:12:09,350
你怎么认识我父亲的
How do you know my father?

255
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:12,040
他叫你兰斯小姐
He called you Ms. Lance.

256
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:16,360
你和已故的兰斯队长什么关系
Any relation to the late Captain Lance?

257
00:12:16,730 --> 00:12:19,300
如果有  你肯定听过我父亲的事
If so, you must have heard stories about my father.

258
00:12:19,590 --> 00:12:21,050
我认识你父亲
I knew your father.

259
00:12:22,050 --> 00:12:23,470
他是个疯子
He was insane.

260
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:26,000
而且好像还遗传给你了
Seems to run in the family.

261
00:12:27,430 --> 00:12:29,150
我会享受杀你
I'm going to enjoy killing you--

262
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:32,170
或者我们都会
or we will.

263
00:12:37,930 --> 00:12:39,340
这是个坏主意
Okay, bad idea.

264
00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:41,420
来吧
Come on.

265
00:12:45,830 --> 00:12:46,990
好啦
All right.

266
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:49,230
我和灰老头将干线重新连上了
Grey and I have got the mains back online.

267
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:50,320
太棒了
Great.

268
00:12:50,430 --> 00:12:54,080
雷在修一个叫量子歧管的东西
Ray's working on something called the quantum manifold.

269
00:12:55,590 --> 00:12:57,830
我好像修不好这玩意儿
But I can't seem to get this to cooperate.

270
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,920
让我来试试
Let me give it a try.

271
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:06,050
你好像很懂行啊
Hey, you actually seem to know what you're doing here.

272
00:13:06,050 --> 00:13:08,310
是的  机械我最懂了
Uh, yeah, machines are kind of my thing.

273
00:13:08,410 --> 00:13:10,240
而且我休息的时候一直在看
Plus, I've been looking at the instruction manual

274
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:11,750
操作手册  所以
in my downtime, so...

275
00:13:11,930 --> 00:13:12,950
大多数人看操作手册
Most people can't follow

276
00:13:12,950 --> 00:13:14,520
都无法拼出一个新书柜来
the instructions to build their new bookcase,

277
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:16,700
而你现在却在修一艘宇宙飞船
and here you are working on a spaceship.

278
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:20,060
而且还是一艘来自未来的时间飞船
A time-traveling spaceship from the future, no less.

279
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:21,490
被你这么一说
Well, when you put it like that,

280
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:23,060
我有点受宠若惊
I am kind of amazing.

281
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:24,670
不要骄傲
And humble.

282
00:13:25,690 --> 00:13:28,970
如果你要组装书柜的话
Hey, if you ever have any bookcases need putting together--

283
00:13:28,970 --> 00:13:30,300
我知道要找谁
I'll know who to call.

284
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,070
雷蒙德
So, Raymond,

285
00:13:37,070 --> 00:13:39,870
你之前和肯德拉一起修理飞船时
you were working with Kendra earlier.

286
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:41,600
我注意到
I couldn't help but notice

287
00:13:41,610 --> 00:13:43,190
你们俩之间似乎有一点...
there might've been a little...

288
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:44,820
火花
spark.

289
00:13:45,190 --> 00:13:47,220
-真的吗  -是的
- Really? - Oh, yes.

290
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:49,580
挺明显的  而且如果我没搞错
It was quite apparent and if I'm not mistaken,

291
00:13:49,590 --> 00:13:53,200
我发现她还朝你多看了几眼
I've noticed her throwing one or two glances your way.

292
00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:56,860
这我可没想到
Wow, that's-- that's surprising.

293
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:59,040
-是吗  -当然
- Is it? - Well, yeah.

294
00:13:59,350 --> 00:14:02,300
我不知道  我对她还真没那种想法
I don't know, I hadn't really considered her in that way.

295
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:05,950
你为什么要提这些
Why are you bringing this up?

296
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:08,760
天呐  感觉像回到了高中
Jeez, I feel like I'm back in high school.

297
00:14:09,130 --> 00:14:11,340
说实话我不了解这些  我高一跳级了
I honestly wouldn't know. I skipped 10th grade.

298
00:14:11,690 --> 00:14:12,860
还有高二
And 11th.

299
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:14,700
我和肯德拉没怎么单独相处过
I haven't really spent that much time with Kendra.

300
00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:17,580
很多时候都是跟她的转世灵魂伴侣和
You know, other than time that we shared with her

301
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:19,200
想杀我们的人
and her reincarnated soulmate,

302
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:21,370
一起相处
or people trying to kill us.

303
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:26,050
所以我们更不该有私情
All the more reason to avoid personal attachments.

304
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:29,860
这艘船或许很大  但我们人不多
This ship may be large, but our group is small.

305
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:32,760
没错
Yeah.

306
00:14:32,890 --> 00:14:34,490
我本来也是这么想的  教授
Preaching to the choir, Professor.

307
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:36,530
我们登上乘波号是为了拯救世界...
We're onboard the Waverider to save the world...

308
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,250
不是乱勾搭
not hook up.

309
00:14:39,490 --> 00:14:41,690
是的  没错
Yes, quite right.

310
00:14:53,170 --> 00:14:55,850
你们听着  我记不住名字
Hey, you, I'm terrible with names.

311
00:14:55,850 --> 00:14:57,800
-我就叫你方兹  -好
- I'm gonna call you Fonzie. - Yeah!

312
00:14:57,810 --> 00:14:59,930
-叫你柯尼基  -好
- I'm gonna call you Kenickie. - Yeah!

313
00:14:59,930 --> 00:15:01,660
还有谁要我赐名字
Anyone else here need a name?

314
00:15:01,690 --> 00:15:05,650
殿下  我能占用您一点时间吗
Your highness, can I get a moment of your time, please?

315
00:15:05,650 --> 00:15:06,780
当然
Sure.

316
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:10,750
未来很棒吧
Isn't the future great?

317
00:15:10,930 --> 00:15:14,130
我们真该回去找里普和莎拉了
We really should be getting back to Rip and Sara.

318
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:14,930
为什么
Why?

319
00:15:14,930 --> 00:15:18,240
因为我可不想在这里扎根驻营
Cause I'm not looking to put down roots here.

320
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:21,020
为什么不呢  这是我们追求的一切
Why not? It's everything we've ever wanted.

321
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:23,750
我有一个帮派  对我言听计从
I got a gang that does everything I tell them to.

322
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:25,230
有裘皮大衣穿
I got a fur coat.

323
00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:27,540
还有美酒喝
I got a chalice.

324
00:15:27,570 --> 00:15:28,860
说到这个
Speaking of.

325
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:32,910
-不管萨维奇了吗  -怎么了
- What about stopping Savage? - What about it?

326
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,170
你说过我们加入
You're the one who said we're in

327
00:15:34,170 --> 00:15:36,040
只是为了干一票  记得吗
this for the score, remember?

328
00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:38,310
我们在这里可以像国王一样生活
We could live like kings here.

329
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:40,320
没有警察  没有英雄
No cops, no heroes--

330
00:15:40,330 --> 00:15:42,430
只有穿着绿色连帽衫的傻瓜
just some fool in a green hoodie.

331
00:15:42,430 --> 00:15:44,140
这里每天都是圣诞节
It's Christmas every day.

332
00:15:45,690 --> 00:15:46,880
我的甜心
My sweet.

333
00:15:55,370 --> 00:15:56,880
斯莱德有儿子吗
Slade had a son?

334
00:15:58,650 --> 00:16:00,070
奥利弗尽力了
Look, Oliver tried.

335
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:03,010
他想招兵对抗丧钟  但是...
He tried to raise an army to fight Deathstroke, but...

336
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:06,420
大家只想离开这里
everyone just wanted to evacuate.

337
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:08,940
要怎么去拯救一座自暴自弃的城市呢
How can you save a city that doesn't want to be saved?

338
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:11,980
稍等片刻
A moment.

339
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:13,300
莎拉  我知道你在想什么
Sara, I know what you must be thinking,

340
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:15,520
但这里发生的一切都不是你的过错
but none of what has transpired here is your fault,

341
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:17,530
你也没有办法改变这一切
nor do you have the means to change it,

342
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:20,660
但可以阻止汪达尔・萨维奇未来的恶行
but Vandal Savage's future is preventable.

343
00:16:21,270 --> 00:16:22,630
求你了
I implore you,

344
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:26,170
求你专注于我们的任务
please stay focused on our mission.

345
00:16:29,310 --> 00:16:30,710
非常谢谢你帮我们
We're very grateful for your assistance,

346
00:16:30,710 --> 00:16:32,000
但我们得出发去斯莫克科技了
but we really must be moving along to Smoak Technologies.

347
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,050
去干什么
What for?

348
00:16:34,310 --> 00:16:36,150
那地方已经关闭好几年了
That place has been cleared out for years,

349
00:16:36,150 --> 00:16:39,130
但费利西蒂・斯莫克的许多项目都转走了
but a lot of Felicity Smoak's projects got relocated.

350
00:16:39,310 --> 00:16:40,250
在哪里
Where?

351
00:16:41,790 --> 00:16:42,700
走吧
Come on.

352
00:16:48,290 --> 00:16:51,420
你先前没说费利西蒂的设备会在这里
You didn't say that Felicity's equipment would be here.

353
00:16:52,850 --> 00:16:54,960
不然你们觉得会在哪里呢
Well, where else would you think it'd be?

354
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:13,840
奎恩先生的行动基地
Mr. Queen's base of operations

355
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:16,140
已经今非昔比了
appears to have seen better days.

356
00:17:16,790 --> 00:17:18,130
是的
Yeah, well...

357
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:20,720
格兰特・威尔逊揭露奎恩是绿箭侠后
the place got attacked after Grant Wilson

358
00:17:20,730 --> 00:17:22,500
这地方就受到了攻击
outed Queen as the Green Arrow.

359
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:29,930
找到我们要的东西后就离开这里吧
Let's just find what we're looking for and get out of here.

360
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:35,500
谁在那里  出去
Whoever's there, get out.

361
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:37,790
我说了  出去
I said get out!

362
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:41,480
不管你是谁  出去
Whoever you are, get out.

363
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:45,560
奥利弗
Oliver?

364
00:17:51,630 --> 00:17:52,830
你好  莎拉
Hello, Sara.

365
00:17:54,510 --> 00:17:56,050
好久不见
Long time no see.

366
00:18:02,670 --> 00:18:04,820
-那是不是  -奥利弗・奎恩
- Is that-- - Oliver Queen.

367
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:08,920
大家都以为你死了
Everyone thinks that you're dead.

368
00:18:08,930 --> 00:18:10,110
没错
They're not wrong.

369
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:12,570
把箭放下  约翰
Put the arrow down, John.

370
00:18:12,570 --> 00:18:14,430
你是在自找麻烦
You're embarrassing yourself.

371
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:16,920
-约翰  -是小约翰・狄格尔
- John? - John Diggle Junior.

372
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:22,180
我爸爸过世了
My dad is dead

373
00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:24,660
因为我救不了他
because I couldn't save him.

374
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:29,450
我不配用他的名字  我叫康纳・霍克
I don't deserve his name. I'm Connor Hawke.

375
00:18:29,450 --> 00:18:31,190
那你不用他的名字
So you won't take his name,

376
00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:34,600
就能穿着别人的战衣到处巡游吗
but it's all right to parade around in someone else's outfit?

377
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:36,010
总得有人穿
Well, someone has to,

378
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:39,990
因为我以为你死了
because last time that I checked, you were dead.

379
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:42,310
大家都以为你死了
Everyone thought you were dead.

380
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:46,790
我以为你不在了
I've been trying to hold this city by myself

381
00:18:47,130 --> 00:18:48,900
所以我独自努力守护这座城市
because I thought you were gone.

382
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:56,590
你怎么了
What happened to you?

383
00:18:57,980 --> 00:18:59,980
还有劳蕾尔  我爸爸
To Laurel, to my dad...

384
00:19:00,690 --> 00:19:02,230
-费利西蒂  -他们都不在了
- Felicity-- - They're gone.

385
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:05,290
-所有的人  -什么意思
- All of them. - What do you mean?

386
00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:09,080
-奥利  -死了
- Ollie-- - Gone.

387
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:11,880
你要我怎么说  莎拉
What do you want me to say, Sara?

388
00:19:11,890 --> 00:19:15,310
三十年前  你和雷跳上了飞船
30 years ago, you and Ray hopped on a spaceship,

389
00:19:16,770 --> 00:19:18,680
-就再也没回来  -会回来的
- and you never came back. - We will.

390
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:20,200
我不想这么说
I don't want to say that...

391
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:22,850
如果当时你和雷没离开
things would have ended differently

392
00:19:22,850 --> 00:19:24,360
事情的结果也许会不一样  但
if you and Ray had been here, but--

393
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:26,730
但如果我们没离开  事情可能会不一样
But if we were, it could've made the difference.

394
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:31,420
你都以为我死了  还来干什么
You thought I was dead. What are you doing here?

395
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:33,980
我们要找费利西蒂・斯莫克当年在研究的
We were looking for a Neuromorphic Prototype

396
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:35,860
神经形态原型
that Felicity Smoak was working on.

397
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:38,930
遭遇这一切后费利西蒂就离开了
Felicity left after everything that happened.

398
00:19:39,490 --> 00:19:41,100
她公司所有的研究
Everything her company was working on

399
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:44,280
都被放在亚当斯和奥尼尔大街的一个仓库里
is being kept in a warehouse at Adams and O'Neil.

400
00:19:44,990 --> 00:19:48,000
-入口密码是4587  -谢谢你
- Entry code is 4-5-8-7. - Thank you, Mr.--

401
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,410
你们从哪进来
You found your way in...

402
00:19:50,510 --> 00:19:51,720
就从哪离开
find your way out.

403
00:19:58,650 --> 00:20:01,280
我得承认你这建议不错  灰老头
I got to admit, that wasn't bad advice, Grey.

404
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:03,220
那你和桑德斯小姐的事还顺利吧
So things went well with Ms. Saunders?

405
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:04,220
当然
Oh, yeah.

406
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:05,050
我还有好消息要告诉你
Well, I have more good news.

407
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:08,590
我非常确定
I was able to very subtly confirm

408
00:20:08,590 --> 00:20:11,050
雷蒙德对你的暗恋对象
that Raymond has no romantic inclinations

409
00:20:11,050 --> 00:20:13,650
完全没有非分之想
towards your crush object.

410
00:20:13,650 --> 00:20:16,220
等理清我的感情生活之后
Okay, well, once we've sorted out my love life,

411
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:18,350
得好好更新一下你的词汇量
we need to update your vocabulary.

412
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:19,480
迫不及待啊
Can't wait.

413
00:20:19,850 --> 00:20:20,920
我去看看肯德拉
I'm gonna go check on Kendra.

414
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,880
-自信点  -明白
- Hey-- confidence. - Yeah.

415
00:20:25,790 --> 00:20:27,690
我已经让原始阻尼器重新连上线了
I got the initial dampeners back online.

416
00:20:27,690 --> 00:20:28,710
等其他队友带回
On the rest of the team returns

417
00:20:28,710 --> 00:20:30,110
神经形态原型
with the Neuromorphic Prototype,

418
00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:31,120
吉迪恩就能重新上岗了
Gideon will be good to go.

419
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:32,230
好极了
Excellent.

420
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:33,800
我们越早离开这里越好
Sooner we get out of here, the better.

421
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:36,350
-顺便谢谢你  -谢什么
- And thank you, by the way. - Whatever for?

422
00:20:36,350 --> 00:20:37,720
在你和我提起之前
Well, till you mentioned it,

423
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:39,830
我没想到我对肯德拉还有这种想法
I hadn't really thought about Kendra in that way,

424
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:41,560
因为她和卡特
because, you know, she and Carter

425
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:43,960
这辈子是注定要在一起的
were destined to be together in this lifetime,

426
00:20:44,030 --> 00:20:46,080
但是一切都变了
but it's all changed

427
00:20:46,330 --> 00:20:48,540
她很特别
and, uh, you know, she's quirky

428
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:50,350
既幽默又漂亮
and funny and beautiful

429
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:52,420
而且焊接技术一流
and a pretty good welder.

430
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:53,700
那么
So-- you know,

431
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:57,360
你要把那些全抛诸脑后了吗
what about all those things we were talking about?

432
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:58,870
我们的任务等等
The mission and so forth?

433
00:20:58,870 --> 00:21:03,260
我们都是成年人嘛
Oh, well, we're all adults here, right?

434
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:05,090
更深入些交往
Getting to know each other a little bit better,

435
00:21:05,410 --> 00:21:07,290
也不会妨碍我们拯救世界
it's not gonna stop us from saving the world.

436
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:10,100
天呐
Oh, boy.

437
00:21:22,970 --> 00:21:24,250
是谁邀请他们来的
Who invited them?

438
00:21:24,810 --> 00:21:27,440
谣言说丧钟对某事很生气
Word on the street is Deathstroke is pissed about something.

439
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:30,040
丧钟是什么破名字
Deathstroke-- what kind of name's that?

440
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:36,470
派对结束了  大家都出去
Party's over. Everyone hit the streets.

441
00:21:36,470 --> 00:21:37,690
告诉所有人
Hit everybody on them.

442
00:21:37,690 --> 00:21:39,810
我要绿箭侠看不见明天的太阳
I want Green Arrow dead by morning.

443
00:21:40,230 --> 00:21:42,940
这些都是我的人
Listen, pal, this is my gang.

444
00:21:42,950 --> 00:21:45,220
他们只听命于我
The only orders they take are from me.

445
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:48,800
也许他们归你管  但这座城市归我管
Hmm, might be your gang, but it's my city.

446
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:54,530
绿箭侠的同伙是一个白衣女刺客和
Green Arrow is running with a female assassin in white

447
00:21:54,530 --> 00:21:56,590
一个穿棕外套的英国佬
and a Brit in a brown coat.

448
00:21:56,590 --> 00:21:57,630
把他们都干掉
Kill them all.

449
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:09,240
都听到指示了  行动吧
Heard the man. Let's go.

450
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:12,010
看来你的新喽
Looks like your new minions

451
00:22:12,010 --> 00:22:14,040
要对里普和莎拉
are about to go on a citywide manhunt

452
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:16,380
-展开全市追捕  -那又怎么样
- for Rip and Sara. - So what?

453
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:18,460
他们要杀我们的朋友
They're gonna kill our friends.

454
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:20,630
他们怎么变成我们的朋友了
Since when did they become our friends?

455
00:22:20,730 --> 00:22:21,610
这得问你
You tell me.

456
00:22:21,610 --> 00:22:24,420
你和雷蒙德在俄国时关系似乎挺好的
You and Raymond seemed to get pretty tight back in Russia.

457
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:25,870
我从没和别人关系好过
I've never been tight with anyone.

458
00:22:25,870 --> 00:22:28,530
米克  该走了
Mick, it's time to go.

459
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:32,510
-你又不是我老大  -我就是
- You're not the boss of me. - Actually, I am.

460
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:40,210
好吧  咱们都深呼吸冷静一下
Okay, let's both take a deep breath.

461
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:43,390
然后咱们来做笔交易
And we'll make ourselves a deal.

462
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:45,330
咱们一起去帮里普和莎拉
You help me get to Rip and Sara.

463
00:22:45,330 --> 00:22:48,760
一旦他们安全了 咱们再谈这事
Once they're safe, we can have this conversation.

464
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:49,950
公平吗
Fair?

465
00:22:58,930 --> 00:23:00,700
{\an8}{\pos(276,164.267)}斯莫克科技

466
00:23:00,350 --> 00:23:03,290
谢谢你愿意陪我们过来  狄格尔先生
Thank you for agreeing to accompany us, Mr. Diggle.

467
00:23:03,970 --> 00:23:05,190
我叫康纳
It's Connor.

468
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:08,680
我不需要待在奥利弗・奎恩的身边
It's not like I needed to stick around Oliver Queen for anything.

469
00:23:17,150 --> 00:23:19,270
-你事先知道吗  -知道什么
- Did you know? - Know what?

470
00:23:19,790 --> 00:23:21,880
我的城市会变成这样
That this is what would happen in my city?

471
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:24,870
奥利弗说事情发展成这样的
Oliver said that the only reason

472
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:25,990
唯一原因就是
that things got so bad

473
00:23:25,990 --> 00:23:27,760
我和雷当时没在这里帮忙
is because Ray and I weren't there to help.

474
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:29,220
应该是吧
I suspected that might be the case,

475
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:31,860
但其实这是件好事
but that's actually a good thing.

476
00:23:32,130 --> 00:23:34,330
现在  一旦我们的任务完成
Now, once our mission is complete

477
00:23:34,330 --> 00:23:37,460
你和帕尔默博士就能返回2016年的星城
and you and Dr. Palmer are returned to Star City in 2016,

478
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:40,760
你俩就可以阻止格兰特・威尔逊的大起义
you will both be present to stop Grant Wilson's Uprising.

479
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,920
这个未来只是一条可能的时间线
This future is only a potential timeline.

480
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:46,380
所以星城不一定会
So this-this version of Star City--

481
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:47,860
变成这个样子吗
this doesn't have to happen?

482
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:49,960
没错  未来一直在变化
Correct. The future is always in flux.

483
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:52,250
希望不会变成这样
Hopefully, this will never come to pass.

484
00:23:54,450 --> 00:23:56,250
这个世界不是真实的
This world isn't real.

485
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,360
我们分开找  可以搜查更多地方
Let's split up. We'll cover more ground.

486
00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:46,440
{\an8}斯莫克科技

487
00:24:52,450 --> 00:24:54,130
你好  宝贝
Hello, beautiful.

488
00:25:14,410 --> 00:25:15,750
敌人为数众多
There's too many of them!

489
00:25:25,930 --> 00:25:28,080
先生们  你们来得正是时候
Gentlemen, your timing is exemplary.

490
00:25:31,290 --> 00:25:32,660
康纳在哪
Where's Connor?

491
00:25:42,190 --> 00:25:43,660
他被抓走了
He's been taken.

492
00:25:48,110 --> 00:25:49,820
他们是格兰特・威尔逊的人
These are Grant Wilson's men.

493
00:25:51,790 --> 00:25:53,810
只有半张脸全身穿着装甲的人
The guy with the half face and the body armor

494
00:25:53,810 --> 00:25:56,210
看来挺喜欢穿连帽衫的孩子的
has a real mad-on for the kid in the hoodie.

495
00:25:57,890 --> 00:26:00,760
-跟我谈一下  -里普
- Can I have a word? - Rip--

496
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:01,690
我知道你想说什么
I know what you're going to say.

497
00:26:01,690 --> 00:26:03,620
-我们要把他救回来  -就是这事
- We have to get him back. - Yes, that.

498
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:04,850
你忘了这个未来
You're forgetting this future

499
00:26:04,850 --> 00:26:06,230
只是一条可能的时间线
is only a potential timeline.

500
00:26:06,230 --> 00:26:08,110
格兰特・威尔逊就在这时杀死康纳
Yeah, where Grant Wilson kills Connor.

501
00:26:08,110 --> 00:26:09,320
威尔逊不会杀死康纳的
Wilson's not going to murder Connor,

502
00:26:09,330 --> 00:26:11,160
因为当你回到2016年
because once you're returned to 2016,

503
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:13,890
威尔逊或康纳都不存在
there won't be a Wilson or a Connor,

504
00:26:14,070 --> 00:26:16,040
至少他们不是现在这个样子
at least not as we know them both right now.

505
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:20,440
既然他们得救了  那咱们接着谈
Now that we rescued them, let's have that chat.

506
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:23,120
你想留在这里
You want to stay here.

507
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:24,510
我以为我已经讲得很清楚了
Thought I made that pretty clear.

508
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:28,070
我不清楚的是  你为什么不想留下
What I'm less clear on is why you don't.

509
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,290
城里全是窃贼和罪犯
A city of thieves and criminals--

510
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,180
感觉会有很多竞争对手
Sounds like a lot of competition.

511
00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:33,430
把他们全部干掉
Then we wipe them out.

512
00:26:33,620 --> 00:26:35,100
我怎么干掉那个人
What I did to that other guy,

513
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:37,350
我们就怎么干掉格兰特・威尔逊
we do the same thing to this Grant Wilson

514
00:26:37,350 --> 00:26:39,810
还有任何挡路的蠢猪
and anyone else stupid enough to get in our way.

515
00:26:41,050 --> 00:26:42,740
看看四周吧  史纳特
Take a look around, Snart.

516
00:26:43,150 --> 00:26:44,600
这就像梦一样
We're living the dream.

517
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:47,520
是啊  说到这里...
Yeah. Speaking of which...

518
00:26:49,590 --> 00:26:51,240
睡个好觉  伙计
Sleep tight, buddy.

519
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,230
他怎么了
What happened to him?

520
00:26:54,230 --> 00:26:55,860
意见不合
Difference of opinion.

521
00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:56,910
好吧
Right.

522
00:26:57,190 --> 00:27:00,970
我们要把这个和罗里先生带回乘波号
We need to get this and Mr. Rory back to the Waverider.

523
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:10,530
杰佛逊  来得正好
Oh, Jefferson, perfect timing.

524
00:27:10,530 --> 00:27:13,100
我需要你的机械知识
I'm in need of your mechanical acumen.

525
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:14,410
好吧  咱们开始吧
Okay, let's do it.

526
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:21,270
怎么了  你干了什么
What? What did you do?

527
00:27:21,270 --> 00:27:22,580
我不知道你在说什么
I don't know what you're talking about.

528
00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:24,860
你干坏事了  你干了什么
You did something. What did you do?

529
00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:26,160
没什么  没什么
Nothing, nothing.

530
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:28,670
你知道  这心灵感应
You know, this psychic connection thing,

531
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:30,230
可是双向的
it goes both ways

532
00:27:30,230 --> 00:27:31,540
从我走进来
and the moment that I walked in here,

533
00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:34,040
我就感到非常焦虑和内疚
I started feeling really anxious and guilty.

534
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:35,570
你感到内疚  你干了什么
You feel guilty, so what did you do?

535
00:27:35,570 --> 00:27:37,430
听我解释  我都是为了你好
In my defense, I was only acting in your best interests.

536
00:27:37,430 --> 00:27:38,320
你干了什么
What did you do?

537
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:40,410
可能在我试图弄清
It's possible in my attempt to discern

538
00:27:40,410 --> 00:27:43,100
帕尔默博士是否想和你抢桑德斯小姐时
whether Dr. Palmer had competing feelings for Ms. Saunders--

539
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:43,760
你不是吧
Oh, you didn't--

540
00:27:43,770 --> 00:27:45,790
我也许不小心激发了
I may have inadvertently prompted him

541
00:27:45,790 --> 00:27:47,970
他对她其他方面的
to think of her in ways in which...

542
00:27:48,140 --> 00:27:49,230
情感
he hadn't.

543
00:27:49,230 --> 00:27:50,720
-灰老头  -对不起
- Ugh, Grey! - I'm sorry.

544
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:52,500
我的本意是很好的
My intentions were honorable.

545
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:56,780
算了  没关系
Ah, it's cool.

546
00:27:57,830 --> 00:27:59,820
-没关系吗  -对
- Is it? - Yeah.

547
00:28:00,050 --> 00:28:02,060
也没什么影响
I mean, nothing's really changed apart from the fact

548
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:05,790
只是现在我得和人竞争
that now I got competition I didn't have before,

549
00:28:05,950 --> 00:28:09,130
但我还是要对自己有信心
but I should still have confidence in myself.

550
00:28:09,130 --> 00:28:10,190
对吗
Right?

551
00:28:11,470 --> 00:28:12,530
对
Right.

552
00:28:14,130 --> 00:28:15,070
他们回来了
Oh, they're back.

553
00:28:15,070 --> 00:28:16,230
罗里先生呢
Where's Mr. Rory?

554
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:18,640
睡着了
Sleeping it off.

555
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,250
我们拿到了神经形态原型
We have the Neuromorphic Prototype.

556
00:28:20,250 --> 00:28:21,850
飞船引擎有进展吗
Any luck with the ship's engines?

557
00:28:21,990 --> 00:28:23,120
有  已经修好了
Yeah, it's all good.

558
00:28:24,390 --> 00:28:26,290
发生什么事了  兰斯小姐
Is there something wrong, Ms. Lance?

559
00:28:26,950 --> 00:28:30,190
我的家人和朋友全都死了
Well, all my friends and family are dead,

560
00:28:30,230 --> 00:28:33,330
只有奥利弗・奎恩活着  可他只是个躯壳了
except for Oliver Queen, who happens to be dead inside

561
00:28:33,330 --> 00:28:34,600
还失去了左臂
and missing his left arm.

562
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:35,730
莎拉  我告诉过你
Sara, I have told you--

563
00:28:35,730 --> 00:28:38,120
这个未来还没固定
That this is just a potential future

564
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:39,660
等我们回到2016年
and that it's all gonna go back

565
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:41,830
如果我们回得去的话
when we return to 2016--

566
00:28:41,870 --> 00:28:43,930
一切都会变回原样
if we return.

567
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:45,530
但如果我们回不去了呢
But what if we don't?

568
00:28:45,530 --> 00:28:47,670
我们都知道卡特回不去了
We all know Carter's not coming back.

569
00:28:47,670 --> 00:28:49,900
我们从事的也不是最安全的工作
It's not like we have the safest line of work.

570
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:54,110
如果莎拉想留下帮忙  我们就应该留下
I think if Sara wants to stay and help that then we should.

571
00:28:54,110 --> 00:28:56,840
当初我们加入这个团队就是为了当英雄
I mean, that's what we signed up for: to be heroes.

572
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:58,000
我赞成杰佛逊的想法
I agree with Jefferson.

573
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,050
是  你们当然都这么想
Yes, of course you both do,

574
00:28:59,050 --> 00:29:02,230
因为你们都不知道改变时间线造成的隐患
because neither of you understand the pitfalls of changing the timeline.

575
00:29:02,230 --> 00:29:04,940
干预未来无疑比改变过去更危险
Meddling with the future is arguably more dangerous

576
00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:07,580
因为未来还没固定
than changing the past, because it is still in flux.

577
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:10,210
你的妻儿会在未来死去
Your wife and son's death are in the future.

578
00:29:11,090 --> 00:29:15,040
-你就想让我们改变它  -别跟我来这套
- You want us to change that. - Don't play that card with me.

579
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:16,040
那又怎么样
So what?

580
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:18,970
你只愿意为了自己的家人拿时间线冒险吗
Are you only willing to risk the timeline if it's your own family?

581
00:29:18,970 --> 00:29:21,570
我不只是为了救我的家人
I am not just trying to save my family

582
00:29:21,570 --> 00:29:24,050
也不只是为了救一座城市
and I'm not just trying to save one city,

583
00:29:24,050 --> 00:29:25,580
而是拯救整个世界
but the entire world!

584
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:28,150
自私的人不是我  莎拉
I'm not the one being selfish, Sara.

585
00:29:28,150 --> 00:29:29,340
下地狱吧你
Go to hell.

586
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:31,830
也许会吧
Most likely.

587
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:34,720
如果你想去救霍克先生
If you want to go and save Mr. Hawke,

588
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:35,910
随你的便
then be my guest.

589
00:29:36,250 --> 00:29:37,780
我会让飞船在这里停一小时
I'll keep the ship here for one hour,

590
00:29:37,780 --> 00:29:38,900
然后就起飞
then we're leaving.

591
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:40,480
不管你有没有上船
With you on board or without.

592
00:29:47,260 --> 00:29:49,030
你好啊  米克
Hello, Mick.

593
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:50,310
你这个混蛋
You son of a bitch.

594
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:51,980
冷静点
Just calm down.

595
00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:53,150
你欺骗了我
You lied to me!

596
00:29:54,650 --> 00:29:56,550
又不是第一次了
Wouldn't be the first time.

597
00:29:56,550 --> 00:29:58,870
记得德雷货币兑换处吗
Remember the Delray Currency Exchange?

598
00:29:58,870 --> 00:30:01,330
还有黑鹰装甲车那次
The Black Hawk Armored Car job?

599
00:30:01,450 --> 00:30:03,130
如果我当时没欺骗你
If I hadn't lied to you on those scores,

600
00:30:03,130 --> 00:30:05,590
我们都会进监狱  或者已经死了
we'd both be in prison or dead.

601
00:30:06,170 --> 00:30:08,330
我是出主意的  你是出力气的
I'm the brains. You're the muscle.

602
00:30:08,330 --> 00:30:10,350
一直都是这样
That's how it's always been.

603
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:13,580
而在某些时候  我必须临危制变
And on occasion, I've had to call some audibles.

604
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:17,120
你总喜欢自讨苦吃  米克
You have a habit of getting in your own way, Mick.

605
00:30:17,750 --> 00:30:19,030
你说得对
You're right.

606
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:20,930
之前干一票的时候你欺骗我
You've lied to me about jobs before,

607
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:23,990
然后你又欺骗我我们这是在干一票
but then again, you lied to me about this being a job.

608
00:30:23,990 --> 00:30:26,030
你现在在意的不是那些金银财宝了
It's not about the score anymore for you.

609
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:30,560
你宁愿拯救世界也不愿做我的搭档
You'd rather save the world than be my partner.

610
00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:32,440
团队意识真强啊
A real team player.

611
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:34,940
因为要打败萨维奇就必须团结一致
'Cause that's what it's gonna take to defeat Savage.

612
00:30:34,950 --> 00:30:38,220
然后呢  更有钱  更有权
Then what? More money? More power?

613
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:40,770
过舒适而罪恶的一生
A life of leisure and sin?

614
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:42,190
你不明白吗  米克
Don't you get it, Mick?

615
00:30:42,190 --> 00:30:44,230
如果我们干掉萨维奇这个永生的恶魔
If we take out Savage, this immortal monster,

616
00:30:44,230 --> 00:30:45,570
你没发现我们会有什么好处吗
can't you see what that gets us?

617
00:30:45,570 --> 00:30:47,260
没有  你说说看
No, tell me.

618
00:30:47,270 --> 00:30:50,910
我们就会成为史上最坏的大坏蛋
We'd be the two baddest sons of bitches of all time.

619
00:30:50,910 --> 00:30:53,250
我不想被人列队欢迎
I don't want a ticker tape parade.

620
00:30:54,770 --> 00:30:57,040
你知道我对这个世界的期许
You know what I want from this world.

621
00:30:58,280 --> 00:30:59,550
知道
Yes...

622
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:02,170
你想看它烧起来
to see it burn.

623
00:31:03,020 --> 00:31:04,850
你再对我动手
You lay a hand on me again,

624
00:31:05,710 --> 00:31:07,390
我也会让你烧起来
you'll burn too.

625
00:31:12,550 --> 00:31:13,960
奥利弗
Oliver.

626
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:17,180
奥利弗
Oliver!

627
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:20,360
不是叫你走了吗
Thought I told you to go.

628
00:31:20,990 --> 00:31:22,710
康纳被格兰特・威尔逊抓走了
Grant Wilson has Connor.

629
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:24,980
他们会把他杀了
They're gonna kill him.

630
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:27,420
他知道自己在干什么
He knew what he was signing up for

631
00:31:27,670 --> 00:31:30,170
你也知道我帮不了他
and you know there's nothing I can do to help him.

632
00:31:30,170 --> 00:31:32,370
这不是我认识的奥利弗・奎恩
That's not the Oliver Queen that I know.

633
00:31:32,370 --> 00:31:34,820
也许我已经不是从前的我了
Maybe I'm not that person anymore.

634
00:31:35,540 --> 00:31:36,840
看看我  莎拉
Look at me, Sara.

635
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:40,160
我其实只是半个从前的我
I'm literally half the man I used to be.

636
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:42,620
这座城市需要那半个你
Then that's the half this city needs.

637
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:44,840
他手下有很多人  奥利
He's got too many men, Ollie.

638
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:47,430
我一个人应付不来
I can't do this by myself.

639
00:31:47,630 --> 00:31:49,080
那你的朋友呢
What about your friends?

640
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:50,320
只有我一个人
I'm on my own--

641
00:31:51,210 --> 00:31:52,770
除非有人帮我
unless I'm not.

642
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:58,180
别逼我  莎拉
Come on, Sara.

643
00:31:58,180 --> 00:31:59,720
我没有机会问康纳
I never got the chance to ask Connor

644
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:02,550
他为什么要穿连帽衫  但我知道原因
why he wears the hood, but I know why.

645
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:06,400
因为这座城市
It's because this city

646
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:08,820
永远需要绿箭侠
will always need a Green Arrow.

647
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:21,630
飞船准备好启程了吗
Is the ship ready for departure?

648
00:32:21,630 --> 00:32:23,460
没有  兰斯女士还没登船
No, Ms. Lance is not yet onboard.

649
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:24,820
我给了她一小时的时间
I gave her an hour.

650
00:32:25,050 --> 00:32:26,070
时间太紧了
Hardly enough time for--

651
00:32:26,070 --> 00:32:27,240
现在已经过去一小时半了
And she's been 90 minutes.

652
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:28,990
我们还要等多久
How much longer are we supposed to wait?

653
00:32:30,020 --> 00:32:33,670
哪怕这个未来还没固定
It doesn't matter that this is a potential future.

654
00:32:33,670 --> 00:32:35,330
哪怕这可能
It doesn't matter that this

655
00:32:35,330 --> 00:32:36,600
根本不会发生
may never come to pass--

656
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:38,030
根本不会成真
may never be real.

657
00:32:38,030 --> 00:32:40,630
但对莎拉来说  眼前的就是真的
For Sara, this is very real.

658
00:32:40,630 --> 00:32:43,110
我知道  所以我多给了她半小时
I know, which is why I gave her an extra 30 minutes.

659
00:32:43,110 --> 00:32:44,350
吉迪恩  飞船情况如何
Gideon, what's our status?

660
00:32:44,350 --> 00:32:46,170
乘波号运作正常  船长
The Waverider is operational, Captain,

661
00:32:46,170 --> 00:32:47,570
但我不能保证能维持多久
but I can't guarantee for how long.

662
00:32:47,570 --> 00:32:49,150
-解释一下  -我们虽然隐身了
- Explain. - We are cloaked,

663
00:32:49,150 --> 00:32:52,090
但和城里的犯罪分子聚集来见证
but positioned dangerously close to where the city's criminal element

664
00:32:52,090 --> 00:32:54,610
康纳・霍克被处决的地点十分靠近
is gathering to witness the execution of Connor Hawke.

665
00:32:54,610 --> 00:32:56,200
等得越久  暴露船体以及
The longer we wait, the greater the risk

666
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:58,620
飞船再次受创的风险就越大
of detection and further damage to the ship.

667
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,240
你真的愿意冒险
Do you really want to risk

668
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:02,750
永远被困在这样的2046年吗
being marooned in this version of 2046 forever?

669
00:33:02,750 --> 00:33:05,710
我更不愿把莎拉留在这里
Certainly more than I want to maroon Sara here.

670
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:08,740
她是我们的朋友  我们的队友
She's our friend. Our teammate.

671
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:12,370
如果我们在阻止萨维奇的过程中
What's the point of stopping Savage

672
00:33:12,370 --> 00:33:16,070
跟他一样冷血  又有什么意义呢
if we only become as immoral as he is in the process?

673
00:33:35,490 --> 00:33:36,730
你应该感到光荣
You should be honored.

674
00:33:37,110 --> 00:33:38,910
这里可是神圣之地
This is hallowed ground.

675
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:40,880
我正是在这里废了
I took Oliver Queen's arm

676
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:43,350
奥利弗・奎恩的手臂
in this very spot.

677
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:46,940
那就放开我
Well, then let me go,

678
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:49,020
看看我跟奎恩
and we'll see which one of us is tougher,

679
00:33:49,430 --> 00:33:50,450
谁更厉害
me or Queen.

680
00:33:50,450 --> 00:33:52,650
我已经知道答案了
I already know the answer to that.

681
00:33:52,930 --> 00:33:54,240
把囚犯压好
Ready the prisoner.

682
00:34:01,180 --> 00:34:02,030
老大
Sir.

683
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:10,240
我们发现她想从边上溜进来
We saw her trying to sneak past the perimeter.

684
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:11,580
太不小心了
Sloppy.

685
00:34:12,290 --> 00:34:15,020
刺客联盟应该会感到羞愧
The League of Assassins would be embarrassed.

686
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:16,650
你有什么计划
What was your strategy here?

687
00:34:16,890 --> 00:34:19,180
你真的以为你今晚可以溜进来
You really think you could just turn up tonight...

688
00:34:20,790 --> 00:34:21,820
把我杀了吗
kill me?

689
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:24,540
不是
No.

690
00:34:25,390 --> 00:34:27,880
我只是来分散你的注意力
It was just my job to distract you.

691
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:02,230
你不是绿箭侠
You're not Green Arrow.

692
00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:04,500
你只是穿着万圣节化装服的废物
You're just a punk in a Halloween costume.

693
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:07,360
挺逗的  我正想对你说同样的话
Funny, I was gonna say the same thing about you.

694
00:35:34,250 --> 00:35:36,070
你想和真的绿箭侠打吗
You want to fight the Green Arrow?

695
00:35:36,670 --> 00:35:37,940
我就在这里
I'm right here.

696
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:58,070
你们是怎么说服里普留下的
How did you convince Rip to stay?

697
00:35:58,070 --> 00:36:00,320
实际上  派援兵过来是他的主意
Actually, sending in the cavalry was his idea.

698
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:11,160
奎恩先生在哪
Where's Mr. Queen?

699
00:36:16,290 --> 00:36:17,350
康纳
Connor!

700
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:41,770
全部都是胆小鬼
Cowards, all!

701
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:47,530
奥利弗
Oliver?

702
00:36:47,530 --> 00:36:50,570
再见到你们真好  雷  肯德拉
It's good to see you again, Ray. Kendra.

703
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:53,040
多谢相助
Thanks for the assist.

704
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:55,010
那么他是谁
So who's that?

705
00:36:55,010 --> 00:36:56,960
他叫格兰特・威尔逊
His name is Grant Wilson.

706
00:36:57,600 --> 00:37:00,030
曾经  他的父亲  斯莱德
Once upon a time, his father, Slade,

707
00:37:00,030 --> 00:37:01,760
想要毁掉我的生活
tried to ruin my life.

708
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:03,360
那可不是个和谐的家庭
That's not a nice family.

709
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:07,030
那一发射得真准  约翰
That's good shooting, John.

710
00:37:12,650 --> 00:37:14,090
是康纳
It's Connor.

711
00:37:15,530 --> 00:37:16,870
总之
Either way,

712
00:37:17,740 --> 00:37:19,380
你是绿箭侠
it's Green Arrow.

713
00:37:29,230 --> 00:37:30,720
我们有很多活干
We have a lot of work to do.

714
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:33,060
格兰特・威尔逊成功地
Grant Wilson did a good job

715
00:37:33,060 --> 00:37:35,880
把城中的犯罪分子都聚集到一起
of keeping the criminal element in the city together.

716
00:37:36,070 --> 00:37:39,190
他们很快又会组织起来
Now, there will be plenty of people to fill the vacuum.

717
00:37:39,410 --> 00:37:41,170
我想留下来
I feel like I should stay.

718
00:37:41,170 --> 00:37:42,260
雷离开前
Before Ray left,

719
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:44,540
告诉过我里普为什么要招募你们
he told me why Rip brought all of you together.

720
00:37:44,830 --> 00:37:46,590
你的使命很重要  莎拉
It's important, Sara.

721
00:37:46,590 --> 00:37:47,750
我不想让你一个人
I just hate the idea

722
00:37:47,750 --> 00:37:49,900
收拾残局
of leaving you here to fix it alone.

723
00:37:50,110 --> 00:37:51,440
我不是一个人
I'm not alone.

724
00:37:57,340 --> 00:37:59,690
你要小心  知道吗
Just--just be careful, all right?

725
00:37:59,770 --> 00:38:01,970
你应该最清楚
Well, you should know better than most

726
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:03,740
我很少会这么做
I rarely ever am.

727
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:15,190
照顾好他
You watch his back.

728
00:38:16,810 --> 00:38:18,340
遵命
Copy that.

729
00:38:20,110 --> 00:38:21,450
我们开工吧
Let's get to work.

730
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:33,220
我要自信点
All right, confidence.

731
00:38:33,590 --> 00:38:35,270
我要自信点
Confidence. Okay.

732
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:38,570
我猜里普可能
So, uh, I think Rip might have

733
00:38:38,570 --> 00:38:40,740
在他的柜子里藏了些伏特加
some of that vodka left in his cabinet.

734
00:38:41,070 --> 00:38:42,090
然后呢
And?

735
00:38:43,030 --> 00:38:44,150
然后
And...

736
00:38:46,060 --> 00:38:47,460
我们喝一杯吧
maybe we could get a drink?

737
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:49,310
你是要约我吗
Are you asking me out?

738
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:52,840
是的  我想是吧
Yes? No. I think so.

739
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:54,780
可以吗
Is that okay?

740
00:38:54,780 --> 00:38:58,120
当然没问题
Yeah, that-- that's totally okay,

741
00:38:58,590 --> 00:39:00,860
只是三个月前
except that three months ago,

742
00:39:00,860 --> 00:39:02,400
我是个再普通不过的人
I was a completely normal person

743
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:05,550
而现在我是鹰女神
and now I'm a hawk goddess

744
00:39:05,550 --> 00:39:06,980
穿越时间
traveling through time,

745
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:09,530
努力不让自己被一个永生疯子杀害
trying to avoid being killed by an immortal psychopath

746
00:39:09,530 --> 00:39:13,360
而他则杀了我的真命天子
who murdered the man I was destined to be with.

747
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:14,420
所以
So...

748
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:16,760
对不起  雷  我...
I'm sorry, Ray. I--

749
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:19,550
我想我的生活已经够复杂了
I think my life's complicated enough

750
00:39:19,550 --> 00:39:23,720
我承受不了其他事了
without throwing whatever this is into the mix.

751
00:39:25,990 --> 00:39:28,510
好  我完全明白
Yeah, totally understand.

752
00:39:29,270 --> 00:39:32,140
如果我是古埃及女祭司转世
If I was a reincarnated Egyptian priestess,

753
00:39:32,140 --> 00:39:33,630
我也会这样想
I'd probably feel the same way.

754
00:39:36,910 --> 00:39:38,620
我去看看斯泰因教授
I'm gonna go check on Professor Stein.

755
00:39:44,550 --> 00:39:46,050
没问题了
All good here.

756
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:49,390
-完全没问题了  -没事吧
- Absolutely no problems. - Everything okay here?

757
00:39:49,390 --> 00:39:52,410
没事  没事  你呢
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, fine. You?

758
00:39:52,410 --> 00:39:54,710
我很好  我很好
Oh, yeah, good. Good. It's good.

759
00:39:57,720 --> 00:39:59,150
你听到了多少
How much of that did you hear?

760
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:02,470
听得挺全的  我很抱歉
Uh, enough. I'm sorry.

761
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:04,040
我也很抱歉
Sorry too.

762
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:07,020
所以你知道我...
Wait, you knew that I--

763
00:40:08,370 --> 00:40:09,440
你藏不住你的心思
You're not that subtle.

764
00:40:11,610 --> 00:40:13,280
顺便告诉你  她会选我的
She would've picked me, by the way.

765
00:40:13,430 --> 00:40:14,820
你就继续做梦吧
Keep telling yourself that.

766
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:17,650
她会选我的
She would've.

767
00:40:23,370 --> 00:40:25,740
我在研究我们的下一个目的地
I'm just working on determining our next destination.

768
00:40:25,740 --> 00:40:27,380
你提议的地狱我考虑过了
I've considered your suggesting of hell,

769
00:40:27,380 --> 00:40:29,470
我决定暂时先不去了
but I think I'll give it a miss for the time being.

770
00:40:31,020 --> 00:40:33,070
我只是想谢谢你
I ju st wanted to say thank you

771
00:40:34,410 --> 00:40:36,390
让队友们来支援我
for sending the team to back me up.

772
00:40:37,930 --> 00:40:39,850
事实证明  你是对的
As it turns out, you were right.

773
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:42,350
这句话很难说出口吧
That must've been hard to say.

774
00:40:43,570 --> 00:40:44,910
如今我不得不承认
Of late I've discovered

775
00:40:44,910 --> 00:40:47,370
我还有很多要学的
that I still have a lot to learn, I admit.

776
00:40:49,890 --> 00:40:52,720
我发现所有的未来都值得我们为之战斗
Including the fact that every future is worth fighting for.

777
00:40:56,070 --> 00:40:57,440
所以...
That said...

778
00:40:58,070 --> 00:40:59,700
这个任务还会继续
this mission is going to continue

779
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:01,630
我们还会面对很多艰难的抉择
to present us with difficult choices,

780
00:41:01,630 --> 00:41:04,720
我想确定你还是不是我们的一员
and I need to know that you are a member of this team.

781
00:41:05,790 --> 00:41:07,020
我想是吧
I guess so.

782
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:13,920
吉迪恩  让我们看看
All right, Gideon, let's see if these repairs

783
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:16,040
马丁  雷和杰克斯是不是完全修好了
that Martin, Ray, and Jax made are up to scratch.

784
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:17,790
在我看来  桑德斯小姐
As far as I can tell, Ms. Saunders

785
00:41:17,790 --> 00:41:19,510
完成了大部分工作  而那两位男士
did most of the work, while the two gentlemen

786
00:41:19,510 --> 00:41:20,850
-则在互相角逐...  -赶紧启程吧
- competed for-- - Just get us out of here.

787
00:41:20,860 --> 00:41:22,220
赶紧了  吉迪恩
Please, Gideon.

788
00:41:27,270 --> 00:41:29,400
我会想念这里的
I'm gonna miss this place.

789
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:32,670
他们挺像你这类人的
Yeah, they really seemed like your kind of people.

790
00:41:33,420 --> 00:41:35,590
我已经不知道我是哪类人了
I don't know who my people are anymore.

791
00:41:36,810 --> 00:41:39,210
下一站去哪里  船长
So where to next, Captain?

792
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:40,330
这个任务美在我们的下一站
Well, the beauty of this mission is that

793
00:41:40,330 --> 00:41:43,740
不是哪里  而是哪一年
the real question is not where, but when.

794
00:41:43,950 --> 00:41:45,620
因此  我们就在萨维奇防不胜防时
In which case, I suggest that we next hit

795
00:41:45,630 --> 00:41:47,930
给他下一击吧
Savage when he least expects it.

800
00:09:36,510 --> 00:10:16,630
