1
00:01:08,568 --> 00:01:12,095
The Jiawu Year autumn auction of...

2
00:01:12,272 --> 00:01:13,603
Bat Island begins now. Lights off, please

3
00:01:23,383 --> 00:01:25,214
Mr. Bat. Please...

4
00:02:30,283 --> 00:02:33,582
The auction begins now.

5
00:02:33,786 --> 00:02:35,754
The first transaction is from room no. 4

6
00:02:35,922 --> 00:02:38,447
The client is a monk from Japan.

7
00:02:39,792 --> 00:02:41,487
What would you like to buy?

8
00:02:41,661 --> 00:02:43,891
I want the head of Chu Liu-hsiang.

9
00:02:48,968 --> 00:02:50,833
I never realized it'd take 3 more days...

10
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:52,763
from Holy Water Palace to the mainland.

11
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,198
The fog has been quite heavy today

12
00:02:55,608 --> 00:02:56,540
What's this place?

13
00:02:56,709 --> 00:02:57,971
I've no idea.

14
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:06,841
A house over there. Let's check it out.

15
00:03:21,901 --> 00:03:24,802
Looks like there's a big banquet here.

16
00:03:26,839 --> 00:03:27,999
Where're the people?

17
00:03:55,602 --> 00:03:58,901
These people from shaolin, Beggars'...

18
00:03:59,539 --> 00:04:03,441
Gang and Mount Zhongnan,

19
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:06,272
are all famous in boxers' world.

20
00:04:06,446 --> 00:04:08,573
Why did they all die here?

21
00:04:11,517 --> 00:04:13,678
This monk looks weird.

22
00:04:13,886 --> 00:04:16,013
Why's he in such a colorful attire?!

23
00:04:16,356 --> 00:04:19,553
One of his arm and leg were broken.

24
00:04:20,994 --> 00:04:22,052
Hey look

25
00:04:32,338 --> 00:04:33,771
Who are you?

26
00:04:34,507 --> 00:04:40,002
No, first tell me who you are!

27
00:04:40,346 --> 00:04:41,643
Who am I?

28
00:04:43,916 --> 00:04:46,282
Don't you know who you are?

29
00:04:48,655 --> 00:04:50,885
I can't recall

30
00:04:55,762 --> 00:04:58,390
I don't know who I am

31
00:04:59,499 --> 00:05:01,729
Frankly I can't remember

32
00:05:05,405 --> 00:05:10,342
strange. Who the hell am I?

33
00:05:12,412 --> 00:05:14,573
Why did I come here?

34
00:05:16,849 --> 00:05:20,615
Right. I need to go to the Bat Island.

35
00:05:21,521 --> 00:05:24,319
I need to go to Bat Island.

36
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:28,825
Bat Island is a mysterious place.

37
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:30,963
I've heard of it before.

38
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:35,533
How about you, Chu Liu-hsiang?
Heard of it?

39
00:05:35,802 --> 00:05:40,501
Bat Island! It does sound familiar

40
00:05:42,608 --> 00:05:43,939
At simin villa, didn't we...

41
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:46,670
see a monk in colorful clothes?

42
00:05:46,846 --> 00:05:47,938
Right!

43
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:56,015
Was he already dead?

44
00:06:04,163 --> 00:06:05,460
Please have a seat.

45
00:06:12,739 --> 00:06:15,469
Master, did you die already?

46
00:06:15,641 --> 00:06:16,972
Why do you ask me such a question?

47
00:06:17,143 --> 00:06:19,737
Because I did see your dead body.

48
00:06:25,418 --> 00:06:26,146
What are you doing?

49
00:06:26,486 --> 00:06:27,953
Tell me where did I die?

50
00:06:28,121 --> 00:06:28,815
Who killed me?

51
00:06:29,021 --> 00:06:30,113
What the hell is this?

52
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:31,479
If you were killed,

53
00:06:31,657 --> 00:06:33,887
you should have seen the killer.

54
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:35,618
The fact is...

55
00:06:35,828 --> 00:06:37,022
he has a twin brother.

56
00:06:37,196 --> 00:06:38,629
They look and dress the same.

57
00:06:38,798 --> 00:06:40,459
Both are handicapped too, but one...

58
00:06:40,666 --> 00:06:43,066
on the left and other on the right.

59
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:46,531
They're known as the Ruin Brothers.

60
00:06:46,706 --> 00:06:48,731
The younger one was recently killed.

61
00:06:48,908 --> 00:06:50,637
He is looking for the murderer.

62
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:52,704
His younger brother was killed,

63
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:54,813
but we didn't kill him.

64
00:06:55,214 --> 00:06:56,203
Why would I trust you?

65
00:06:56,549 --> 00:06:57,573
Who are you?

66
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:00,810
I don't seek your trust.

67
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:02,078
But standing right in front of you...

68
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:04,481
is the world famous Chu Liu-hsiang.

69
00:07:05,057 --> 00:07:06,490
Chu Liu-hsiang?

70
00:07:06,726 --> 00:07:08,125
You're Master Hsiang!

71
00:07:08,461 --> 00:07:09,450
Nice to meet you.

72
00:07:09,629 --> 00:07:10,618
You're...

73
00:07:10,797 --> 00:07:13,630
I'm Li Yuhan, my wife Liu Wumin.

74
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:16,598
The whole thing was just a
misunderstanding

75
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:18,100
Honey, look...

76
00:07:22,542 --> 00:07:25,067
Excuse me. I've to leave now.

77
00:07:29,515 --> 00:07:31,540
Look...

78
00:07:33,653 --> 00:07:34,620
Who is she?

79
00:07:34,887 --> 00:07:36,081
Master Fumei

80
00:07:36,722 --> 00:07:37,711
Did you get it wrong?

81
00:07:37,924 --> 00:07:38,891
No, I didn't.

82
00:07:39,058 --> 00:07:40,821
Let's rent a boat to check it out.

83
00:07:41,894 --> 00:07:42,485
Strange... I heard

84
00:07:42,662 --> 00:07:43,959
he withdrew from the boxers' world.

85
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:45,097
Why does he show up again?

86
00:07:45,264 --> 00:07:48,597
Look at the boat he just took.

87
00:07:49,235 --> 00:07:51,533
Get us over there quick.

88
00:07:58,044 --> 00:07:59,909
Why was the boat all burnt up?

89
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:02,013
Looks like we're late.

90
00:08:05,685 --> 00:08:09,553
Do you think what happened was strange?

91
00:08:09,722 --> 00:08:12,486
12 people were killed at simin villa.

92
00:08:12,658 --> 00:08:14,922
The skillful boxer in white clothes...

93
00:08:15,127 --> 00:08:17,755
couldn't recall his identity and...

94
00:08:17,964 --> 00:08:22,060
the mysterious youngster in white hair!

95
00:08:22,235 --> 00:08:24,169
Most important of all, Master Fumei...

96
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:27,940
appeared and now suddenly vanishes!

97
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:31,701
Something must've happened
in boxers' world.

98
00:08:31,878 --> 00:08:33,311
I share the same view.

99
00:08:33,746 --> 00:08:34,610
Help!

100
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:36,145
Wumin, hold on.

101
00:08:36,315 --> 00:08:38,283
It's very painful!

102
00:08:38,784 --> 00:08:39,910
Waiter, get me some wine.

103
00:08:40,086 --> 00:08:40,313
Okay.

104
00:08:40,653 --> 00:08:42,587
It's you, Li. What's the matter?

105
00:08:42,755 --> 00:08:44,780
My wife just isn't feeling good
all of a sudden

106
00:08:44,991 --> 00:08:47,255
It occurs frequently and causes much pain

107
00:08:47,593 --> 00:08:49,584
I want some wine to mix medicine for her

108
00:08:49,762 --> 00:08:50,922
sir, the wine is here.

109
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:51,892
Thanks.

110
00:08:52,064 --> 00:08:53,156
Excuse me...

111
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,735
The dinner and drinks are all served

112
00:09:04,677 --> 00:09:07,237
strange. I mean, they both staying here!

113
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:09,605
Who cares? I've touched the red clothes,

114
00:09:09,782 --> 00:09:11,613
black and white clothes.

115
00:09:11,784 --> 00:09:14,150
2 more green clothes is no big deal.

116
00:09:21,627 --> 00:09:23,595
Come on, try it.

117
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:25,922
Hold it

118
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:28,132
Do you pour wine with your right hand?

119
00:09:28,301 --> 00:09:30,701
Yes, I do.

120
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:32,633
When we came back...

121
00:09:32,805 --> 00:09:34,966
the wine pot was placed like this.

122
00:09:35,308 --> 00:09:37,936
But when you pour wine,

123
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:40,078
the pot becomes in this position

124
00:09:40,746 --> 00:09:41,906
Then...

125
00:09:42,081 --> 00:09:44,345
After we left for a while,

126
00:09:44,684 --> 00:09:47,175
someone had moved the pot.

127
00:09:49,889 --> 00:09:50,947
Right.

128
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:52,618
Don't drink it.

129
00:09:52,792 --> 00:09:54,020
I've already had a sip

130
00:09:55,227 --> 00:09:57,286
Master Hsiang.

131
00:10:10,242 --> 00:10:11,368
Who are you?

132
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,711
Your skill is remarkable...

133
00:10:22,888 --> 00:10:27,257
as very few can resist 10 attacks from me

134
00:10:27,426 --> 00:10:29,394
But I feel strange.

135
00:10:29,762 --> 00:10:31,855
You're not going to kill me,

136
00:10:32,031 --> 00:10:33,760
but just to keep me here.

137
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:44,708
Your real purpose is to kill Master Hsiang

138
00:10:50,082 --> 00:10:52,414
After all you're not stupid, huh

139
00:10:52,752 --> 00:10:56,119
But it's too late to realize it.

140
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:16,001
What? You're still alive?

141
00:11:17,743 --> 00:11:20,712
I knew the wine pot was wrongly placed

142
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,279
When I drank,

143
00:11:22,448 --> 00:11:24,746
I had poured the wine here.

144
00:11:55,848 --> 00:11:57,042
Why did you kill him?

145
00:11:57,216 --> 00:11:58,308
He fought with you two.

146
00:11:58,484 --> 00:12:00,145
I think he mustn't be a good man.

147
00:12:00,319 --> 00:12:01,377
It's because of this,

148
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:03,985
I've many questions to ask him.

149
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:05,450
What?

150
00:12:06,492 --> 00:12:08,119
Someone wants to assassinate Master Hsiang.

151
00:12:08,294 --> 00:12:09,124
So I've killed him.

152
00:12:09,295 --> 00:12:12,093
What? How would he dare to kill Hsiang?

153
00:12:12,264 --> 00:12:14,027
He must be crazy.

154
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:16,291
Li, is this precious sword...

155
00:12:16,469 --> 00:12:19,336
the ancient, long-Iost Cangshan sword?

156
00:12:22,374 --> 00:12:24,069
This sword was lost for years.

157
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:26,108
How did you get it?

158
00:12:26,545 --> 00:12:29,912
Have you heard of the Jade villa?

159
00:12:30,316 --> 00:12:31,476
Yes, of course.

160
00:12:31,851 --> 00:12:35,252
Jade villa is where the no. 1 swordsman...

161
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:37,184
Li Guanyu keeps his precious swords.

162
00:12:37,356 --> 00:12:39,347
Li Guanyu is my father.

163
00:12:39,892 --> 00:12:41,985
If you're interested,

164
00:12:42,161 --> 00:12:43,185
please come and visit my place.

165
00:12:43,362 --> 00:12:45,330
We've collected many precious swords.

166
00:12:45,498 --> 00:12:47,363
Appreciating precious swords...

167
00:12:47,533 --> 00:12:49,023
always gives me immense pleasure.

168
00:12:49,201 --> 00:12:50,532
Yi Tien-hung, will you join me?

169
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:53,862
I'm tired of dealing with swords.

170
00:12:54,073 --> 00:12:57,008
Besides, I've things to do

171
00:12:57,176 --> 00:12:58,473
Please excuse me.

172
00:13:05,084 --> 00:13:06,847
From here,

173
00:13:07,019 --> 00:13:09,544
it's already the domain of Jade villa

174
00:13:11,991 --> 00:13:13,083
Brilliant

175
00:13:13,559 --> 00:13:15,186
If it interests you,

176
00:13:15,394 --> 00:13:16,918
you may take a look wherever you please

177
00:13:17,096 --> 00:13:19,394
We'd have to leave to arrange for the meals

178
00:13:19,565 --> 00:13:20,554
okay...

179
00:13:20,966 --> 00:13:23,332
over there is our home

180
00:13:23,502 --> 00:13:24,400
Please...

181
00:13:44,924 --> 00:13:47,154
Master Hsiang, here you are

182
00:13:48,294 --> 00:13:50,194
This place is beautiful.

183
00:13:50,563 --> 00:13:54,192
This is where my father tested the swords.

184
00:13:57,069 --> 00:13:59,060
Mr. Li was really a swords lover.

185
00:13:59,238 --> 00:14:01,206
He deserved being the no. 1 swordsman.

186
00:14:01,407 --> 00:14:04,968
My father valued the swords a great deal.

187
00:14:05,144 --> 00:14:09,274
He took interest in everything
related to swords

188
00:14:09,481 --> 00:14:12,075
But before he died,

189
00:14:12,251 --> 00:14:14,219
he had an unfulfilled wish.

190
00:14:15,221 --> 00:14:16,552
What's the wish?

191
00:14:16,889 --> 00:14:18,914
My father studied...

192
00:14:19,091 --> 00:14:22,356
every kind of sword fight

193
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:26,521
He had not invented an invincible
sword troop.

194
00:14:27,466 --> 00:14:30,594
He devoted his life for swords...

195
00:14:30,936 --> 00:14:33,063
and invented Wuhan sword array.

196
00:14:34,139 --> 00:14:36,630
But still it hasn't been proved...

197
00:14:36,976 --> 00:14:39,274
if it's invincible.

198
00:14:39,678 --> 00:14:40,645
How come?

199
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:43,210
Because no one tried this sword formation

200
00:14:45,684 --> 00:14:48,244
The person must be the best fighter.

201
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:50,581
Also he has to be quite reknown

202
00:14:50,923 --> 00:14:54,552
Then the result will become outstanding

203
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:57,624
Master Hsiang
is the only qualified boxer...

204
00:14:57,963 --> 00:14:59,590
in the world.

205
00:15:00,599 --> 00:15:03,500
So you and your wife tried your best...

206
00:15:03,669 --> 00:15:05,296
to ensure bringing me here

207
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:20,711
This is your sword.

208
00:15:22,354 --> 00:15:24,083
Seems like I don't have a choice today

209
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:26,224
Please...

210
00:15:47,079 --> 00:15:49,980
I think Mr. Li's wish wasn't to do a test...

211
00:15:50,149 --> 00:15:53,676
but to kill me.

212
00:15:54,253 --> 00:15:55,652
Why do you say so?

213
00:15:57,656 --> 00:16:00,216
If there's no defeat in the sword troop,

214
00:16:00,392 --> 00:16:02,383
I'd die here immediately

215
00:16:02,561 --> 00:16:03,960
Even if there's a defeat,

216
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:06,393
with 5 skillful swordsmen attacking me,

217
00:16:06,565 --> 00:16:08,192
I'll be surely dead.

218
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:13,401
At the Liufu Inn,

219
00:16:13,572 --> 00:16:15,369
it already felt strange, as to...

220
00:16:15,541 --> 00:16:17,441
why'd someone kill the man in black!

221
00:16:18,043 --> 00:16:21,137
Li Yuhan, what's wrong?

222
00:16:27,419 --> 00:16:29,080
Don't ask anymore.

223
00:16:29,288 --> 00:16:32,985
We just want to kill you.

224
00:17:44,563 --> 00:17:47,464
Your father's sword troop is really good

225
00:17:47,633 --> 00:17:50,295
Looks like Chu Liu-hsiang can't...

226
00:17:50,469 --> 00:17:52,460
defeat the sword troop.

227
00:18:07,653 --> 00:18:08,711
Don't move.

228
00:18:13,525 --> 00:18:15,652
For 15 years I've been admiring the...

229
00:18:15,828 --> 00:18:19,594
greatness of your Yuanyang swords.

230
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:22,893
My pleasure fighting against you today.

231
00:18:25,804 --> 00:18:27,237
How did you recognize me?

232
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:31,309
When playing with 2 swords,
a person uses<i>: : :</i>

233
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:33,876
Only one; the other hand always
forms a fist.

234
00:18:34,613 --> 00:18:36,240
For someone using just a single sword,

235
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:38,883
the fingers of his other hand are
usually out.

236
00:18:39,218 --> 00:18:41,118
This is your habit I'm employing, sir...

237
00:18:41,286 --> 00:18:42,548
Handing you a sword all of a sudden

238
00:18:42,721 --> 00:18:44,552
I think you will understand.

239
00:18:44,723 --> 00:18:46,918
This sword array can't have
one sword less...

240
00:18:47,259 --> 00:18:49,750
and of course can't have one more.

241
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:56,693
Chu Liu-hsiang is really good.

242
00:18:56,935 --> 00:19:02,237
Priest Tieshan, Gentlemen sword and

243
00:19:02,407 --> 00:19:02,896
Bamboo sword, all of you...

244
00:19:03,242 --> 00:19:05,802
are top swordsmen from righteous schools

245
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:07,544
No wonder you all cover face with a mask

246
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:12,311
What actually have I done to offend you?

247
00:19:12,484 --> 00:19:14,349
Why did you have to kill me?

248
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:16,613
We didn't intend to kill you,

249
00:19:16,788 --> 00:19:18,688
but to pay our debts. Li's family...

250
00:19:23,595 --> 00:19:25,563
has only one son for 3 generations

251
00:19:25,731 --> 00:19:28,325
Mrs. Li was pregnant,

252
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:31,162
but she has a special disease, which can...

253
00:19:31,336 --> 00:19:35,170
only be cured by the poppy from India

254
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:40,175
But the poppy seller asked for your life

255
00:19:40,345 --> 00:19:43,906
save the only son of an old friend...

256
00:19:45,918 --> 00:19:49,945
Hold it.

257
00:19:50,289 --> 00:19:53,281
Li, Master Hsiang defeated the formation...

258
00:19:53,458 --> 00:19:54,789
and didn't try to kill us.

259
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,757
Now you repay his goodness.

260
00:19:56,929 --> 00:20:00,262
We can't do these kind of immoral things.

261
00:20:00,465 --> 00:20:02,626
Lacking filial devotion is a great sin.

262
00:20:02,801 --> 00:20:05,292
You see, I can't afford caring too much.

263
00:20:05,571 --> 00:20:08,472
Why are you blocking me, sir?

264
00:20:16,315 --> 00:20:17,646
Priest Tieshan, can you bear...

265
00:20:17,816 --> 00:20:20,216
watching Li's family terminated?

266
00:20:20,385 --> 00:20:24,378
Where's the justice if I let you go?

267
00:20:24,556 --> 00:20:27,650
Hereafter how can I face
my Wutang students?

268
00:20:28,293 --> 00:20:31,660
But you can't refuse to pay
my father's debt

269
00:20:34,466 --> 00:20:35,558
okay.

270
00:20:37,035 --> 00:20:39,265
Priest...

271
00:20:39,538 --> 00:20:40,835
Chu Liu-hsiang

272
00:20:41,006 --> 00:20:46,239
I'm not able to save with my broken arm.

273
00:20:46,678 --> 00:20:48,771
Owing to such a person like Priest Tieshan,

274
00:20:48,947 --> 00:20:52,644
the word 'justice' still lives on

275
00:20:53,552 --> 00:20:55,042
What are you waiting for?

276
00:20:56,521 --> 00:20:59,752
Thank you, sir.

277
00:21:03,362 --> 00:21:05,830
Wumin, what are you doing?

278
00:21:06,031 --> 00:21:08,659
Yuhan, forget it.

279
00:21:08,834 --> 00:21:11,064
What Priest Tieshan said is right.

280
00:21:11,403 --> 00:21:14,804
The Li family can't do wrong things.

281
00:21:14,973 --> 00:21:17,533
But your illness...

282
00:21:17,709 --> 00:21:21,270
I'm a nobody in the boxers' world.

283
00:21:21,446 --> 00:21:24,074
Nothing to compare with hsiang's life.

284
00:21:25,917 --> 00:21:31,617
After my death, I request you to re-marry

285
00:21:37,596 --> 00:21:41,657
Please forgive him, master hsiang.

286
00:21:41,833 --> 00:21:46,065
What he did was because of me.

287
00:21:46,438 --> 00:21:50,033
What we owed you,

288
00:21:50,409 --> 00:21:53,845
we'd pay you back in next life.

289
00:21:54,012 --> 00:21:57,379
You saved my life.

290
00:21:57,549 --> 00:21:58,447
How can I...

291
00:21:58,617 --> 00:22:00,642
let you die for nothing?

292
00:22:00,819 --> 00:22:01,717
Tell me...

293
00:22:01,887 --> 00:22:03,855
where can I buy the poppy from India?

294
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:06,689
Bat Island.

295
00:22:09,861 --> 00:22:10,987
Bat Island is a recent...

296
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:12,592
uprising triad organisation

297
00:22:12,764 --> 00:22:14,061
It's known that if you've money,

298
00:22:14,399 --> 00:22:15,366
you can buy drugs, life or...

299
00:22:15,534 --> 00:22:17,058
even the secrets of the boxers' world.

300
00:22:17,402 --> 00:22:18,027
Who heads that gang?

301
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:19,496
Someone called Mr. Bat.

302
00:22:19,671 --> 00:22:20,638
He's an extremely good fighter.

303
00:22:20,806 --> 00:22:22,137
But no one knows who he is

304
00:22:22,474 --> 00:22:23,805
Why?

305
00:22:24,443 --> 00:22:27,435
When they conduct a deal, no lights are on.

306
00:22:27,646 --> 00:22:29,773
So, no one ever sees...

307
00:22:29,948 --> 00:22:31,506
his real face.

308
00:22:32,551 --> 00:22:35,042
How can I go to the Bat Island?

309
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:37,053
I don't know.

310
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:40,558
Why doesn't anyone ever ask us?

311
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:47,421
What? Aren't we people?

312
00:22:47,866 --> 00:22:49,163
You didn't ask us.

313
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:53,536
My dearest Miss song and Miss Li,

314
00:22:53,705 --> 00:22:54,569
I, Chu Liu-hsiang,

315
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:57,368
ask you how I can reach the island.

316
00:22:58,176 --> 00:23:00,610
The Queen lost a pearl waist-belt lately

317
00:23:00,812 --> 00:23:03,508
The Invisible Thief Zhu Tong has stolen it

318
00:23:03,682 --> 00:23:06,480
He can sell the things stolen from...

319
00:23:06,685 --> 00:23:09,620
the King at Bat Island.

320
00:23:10,922 --> 00:23:12,947
Say, If I had to go to Bat Island,

321
00:23:13,158 --> 00:23:15,524
I'd rather find the Invisible Thief first.

322
00:23:15,694 --> 00:23:16,854
Right.

323
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:22,799
I know whoever goes there needs a mark.

324
00:23:23,402 --> 00:23:26,530
Li Yuhan has given me the mark.

325
00:23:26,872 --> 00:23:29,067
But I don't know how...

326
00:23:29,408 --> 00:23:31,842
I can get in touch with the people there.

327
00:23:32,177 --> 00:23:33,804
I know the one who stole the belt...

328
00:23:34,012 --> 00:23:35,639
has arrived at the Qinhuai River.

329
00:23:35,814 --> 00:23:37,611
What kind of a person is he?

330
00:23:38,417 --> 00:23:41,045
Simple. He must look like a thief.

331
00:23:47,793 --> 00:23:49,522
Please come in...

332
00:23:52,564 --> 00:23:54,191
Please be seated

333
00:23:58,904 --> 00:24:00,166
The Invisible Thief...

334
00:24:00,539 --> 00:24:02,632
does indeed look like a thief!

335
00:25:03,535 --> 00:25:04,263
Come on.

336
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:43,266
Brother, I'm not a bad guy.

337
00:25:43,608 --> 00:25:44,302
I just want to ask you a few questions.

338
00:25:44,643 --> 00:25:46,042
Mute buddy, come in quick.

339
00:26:06,031 --> 00:26:06,895
Strange... why does this house...

340
00:26:07,065 --> 00:26:09,693
float to the middle of the sea?

341
00:26:24,749 --> 00:26:27,843
Why is there a big house here?

342
00:26:34,292 --> 00:26:35,691
How can it move?

343
00:26:38,229 --> 00:26:41,164
Why does my house move towards it?

344
00:27:08,293 --> 00:27:09,783
What is this place?

345
00:27:22,941 --> 00:27:24,203
You don't need to know.

346
00:27:36,888 --> 00:27:37,877
I don't know you.

347
00:27:38,089 --> 00:27:39,056
Why did you try to kill me?

348
00:27:39,224 --> 00:27:40,122
I don't know you.

349
00:27:40,291 --> 00:27:41,724
That's the reason I have to kill you.

350
00:27:47,098 --> 00:27:49,658
Before you kill me, can you tell me why...

351
00:27:49,834 --> 00:27:52,826
this small house is drawn
toward the big one?

352
00:27:53,004 --> 00:27:54,699
Because under the house,

353
00:27:54,873 --> 00:27:56,807
there's a long rope pulling it.

354
00:27:58,443 --> 00:27:59,467
I see.

355
00:27:59,811 --> 00:28:02,905
Who's the master of the big house?

356
00:28:03,081 --> 00:28:05,174
Mr. Bat of Bat Island.

357
00:28:08,053 --> 00:28:10,453
So they go to Bat Island from here.

358
00:28:10,789 --> 00:28:11,949
None of your business.

359
00:28:19,130 --> 00:28:21,394
You've not told me who you are

360
00:28:21,733 --> 00:28:23,291
In case you kill me later,
I can at least tell...

361
00:28:23,468 --> 00:28:25,060
the Hell Master who sent me there.

362
00:28:25,236 --> 00:28:26,931
You know,
it'll be so embarrassing if I can't

363
00:28:30,141 --> 00:28:33,440
You're a funny man. I'm Xiang Feitian,

364
00:28:33,778 --> 00:28:36,804
keeper of the 78th branch of the Island

365
00:28:37,015 --> 00:28:39,506
Everyone going to the Island...

366
00:28:39,851 --> 00:28:41,375
will be taken care of by me.

367
00:28:42,987 --> 00:28:44,784
Take care of what?

368
00:28:44,956 --> 00:28:47,447
If you're a guest, I'll escort you through

369
00:28:47,792 --> 00:28:50,283
If not, I'll kill you.

370
00:28:56,201 --> 00:28:57,896
How do you know I'm not a guest?

371
00:28:58,069 --> 00:28:59,934
Because I haven't seen you before.

372
00:29:00,105 --> 00:29:03,438
But you did meet my master.

373
00:29:03,775 --> 00:29:05,265
Who might he be?

374
00:29:05,443 --> 00:29:08,844
Li Yuhan of Jade villa.

375
00:29:18,857 --> 00:29:21,087
In which category is he registered?

376
00:29:22,193 --> 00:29:23,319
Yu category.

377
00:29:24,395 --> 00:29:27,193
- What does he want to buy?
- Poppy.

378
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:29,559
Proof?

379
00:29:36,908 --> 00:29:39,035
You are our guest.

380
00:29:39,244 --> 00:29:41,542
Guests from the 3rd stop have arrived

381
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:51,279
Which category you registered at 3rd stop?

382
00:29:55,593 --> 00:29:57,083
Di category.

383
00:29:58,930 --> 00:30:00,397
Gongsun Jiemin...

384
00:30:00,565 --> 00:30:02,157
Yes, it's me

385
00:30:02,333 --> 00:30:04,198
Guests from 5th stop arrived.

386
00:30:07,272 --> 00:30:09,866
Mr. Long registered with Xuan.

387
00:30:10,041 --> 00:30:11,008
Here's the proof

388
00:30:13,578 --> 00:30:15,443
Mr. Long Wu, what's the matter?

389
00:30:15,613 --> 00:30:17,205
You brought along 2 servants.

390
00:30:17,882 --> 00:30:20,976
Yes. They've been taking care of me...

391
00:30:21,152 --> 00:30:23,382
since my birth

392
00:30:24,155 --> 00:30:27,022
But the boat fee is very expensive.

393
00:30:27,959 --> 00:30:29,586
The money is here.

394
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:34,526
Okay, let's go.

395
00:30:35,466 --> 00:30:36,592
Please...

396
00:30:50,048 --> 00:30:53,415
- Please
- Please...

397
00:30:57,555 --> 00:30:58,351
What do you want?

398
00:30:58,523 --> 00:30:59,888
I'm trying to help you.

399
00:31:00,325 --> 00:31:01,485
Thanks.

400
00:31:45,303 --> 00:31:46,531
Please...

401
00:31:53,411 --> 00:31:54,207
Please...

402
00:31:54,512 --> 00:31:56,343
Please...

403
00:31:58,316 --> 00:31:59,510
Please...

404
00:32:12,363 --> 00:32:13,591
Please...

405
00:32:33,284 --> 00:32:35,149
Boatsman, please.

406
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:03,513
Everyone is here.

407
00:33:03,681 --> 00:33:05,410
All are here.

408
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:06,708
Take them inside first.

409
00:33:07,051 --> 00:33:09,212
Let them check in their rooms.

410
00:33:15,493 --> 00:33:16,755
Please...

411
00:33:21,265 --> 00:33:22,391
Please...

412
00:33:24,669 --> 00:33:25,727
This way.

413
00:33:33,611 --> 00:33:34,771
Lady, please.

414
00:33:37,648 --> 00:33:39,479
Please...

415
00:33:44,088 --> 00:33:44,747
Yi Tien-hung.

416
00:33:45,089 --> 00:33:47,080
Why are you here?

417
00:33:48,526 --> 00:33:50,426
I'm on business.

418
00:33:50,628 --> 00:33:52,357
I've someone to kill.

419
00:33:52,764 --> 00:33:55,699
After you had gone, I got a letter...

420
00:33:56,034 --> 00:33:57,626
saying I'd get 1 million taels of gold...

421
00:33:57,835 --> 00:33:59,393
to kill someone.

422
00:33:59,570 --> 00:34:02,562
So I followed the address to meet a man.

423
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:04,640
The man brought me here and
told me that...

424
00:34:04,809 --> 00:34:08,575
the man I need to kill is on the Island

425
00:34:08,746 --> 00:34:12,443
What? Kill someone on the Island? Who?

426
00:34:12,650 --> 00:34:17,644
No idea. What I do know is just that...

427
00:34:17,855 --> 00:34:20,449
the man has a very special thing.

428
00:34:24,228 --> 00:34:25,422
According to the pigeon's note,

429
00:34:25,596 --> 00:34:28,827
boats from the 24 branches were gone.

430
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:33,068
The guests going to Bat Island this time

431
00:34:34,305 --> 00:34:35,704
Guests on our boat...

432
00:34:35,873 --> 00:34:37,306
were all checked.

433
00:34:37,475 --> 00:34:38,840
All were checked.

434
00:34:39,544 --> 00:34:42,536
There's a filial lady in Tian room.

435
00:34:42,713 --> 00:34:44,476
She's on her way to the Island...

436
00:34:44,682 --> 00:34:47,310
because she wants to buy her father back

437
00:34:47,485 --> 00:34:50,852
she said he was confined on the island.

438
00:34:51,322 --> 00:34:53,586
The dumb man is her loyal servant,

439
00:34:53,758 --> 00:34:55,817
staying by her side forever.

440
00:34:56,694 --> 00:34:57,718
The guest at Di room...

441
00:34:57,895 --> 00:35:00,557
is a wealthy boxer.

442
00:35:00,731 --> 00:35:02,494
He goes to the Island...

443
00:35:02,667 --> 00:35:05,329
to buy something precious.

444
00:35:06,137 --> 00:35:07,729
The guest at Xuan room...

445
00:35:07,905 --> 00:35:11,671
Iooks like a man from a wealthy family.

446
00:35:11,843 --> 00:35:16,337
But I know he's a royal guard.

447
00:35:16,514 --> 00:35:18,209
Maybe he's investigating...

448
00:35:18,416 --> 00:35:21,510
the case of the Queen's lost pearl.

449
00:35:23,688 --> 00:35:25,155
The guest at Wang room;

450
00:35:25,756 --> 00:35:27,747
um... he's kind of mysterious!

451
00:35:27,925 --> 00:35:29,483
He didn't say a word.

452
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:31,787
He just gave me 10 pearls and asked...

453
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:35,156
to hide on the Island for a few years

454
00:35:35,433 --> 00:35:36,832
Looks like he could be the one...

455
00:35:37,168 --> 00:35:39,398
who stole the Queen's pearl.

456
00:35:44,575 --> 00:35:46,907
A letter from headquarters is here.

457
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:56,944
This isn't right.

458
00:35:57,288 --> 00:35:59,620
The letter says there's a spy on the boat

459
00:35:59,790 --> 00:36:01,849
Mr. Bat asked us to bring his body back

460
00:36:03,828 --> 00:36:05,295
6 will be enough.

461
00:36:06,797 --> 00:36:08,560
The same old way...

462
00:36:08,733 --> 00:36:11,702
Kill everyone the headquarter wants.

463
00:36:12,236 --> 00:36:13,897
Do it tomorrow.

464
00:36:21,913 --> 00:36:22,436
Who?

465
00:36:22,613 --> 00:36:23,477
It's me.

466
00:36:24,815 --> 00:36:25,804
You...

467
00:36:26,651 --> 00:36:28,619
Why are you looking for me stealthily?

468
00:36:28,786 --> 00:36:29,810
Follow me.

469
00:36:34,659 --> 00:36:35,455
Yesterday night...

470
00:36:35,626 --> 00:36:36,957
I heard they said...

471
00:36:37,328 --> 00:36:38,818
they'd kill all of us.

472
00:36:39,363 --> 00:36:39,886
Who are you?

473
00:36:40,231 --> 00:36:41,357
I'm Jin Linzhi.

474
00:36:41,532 --> 00:36:43,523
My dad specializes in building houses.

475
00:36:43,901 --> 00:36:47,428
5 years ago, my dad was given a contract

476
00:36:47,638 --> 00:36:49,731
After that, he didn't came back.

477
00:36:50,007 --> 00:36:53,602
I found out he's captured at the Island

478
00:36:53,811 --> 00:36:56,871
so I'm going along with my servant...

479
00:36:57,215 --> 00:36:58,477
to the bat island.

480
00:36:59,250 --> 00:36:59,978
I have to save my dad

481
00:37:00,318 --> 00:37:01,808
Master Hsiang, I must go to the Island.

482
00:37:01,986 --> 00:37:03,817
I can't let them kill me.

483
00:37:03,988 --> 00:37:06,684
Quiet... Miss Jin.

484
00:37:06,857 --> 00:37:08,916
First, you don't know who they will kill

485
00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:09,954
second, you don't know when...

486
00:37:10,328 --> 00:37:10,953
they will do it.

487
00:37:11,295 --> 00:37:13,229
I know. They said this morning.

488
00:37:13,397 --> 00:37:14,921
Maybe someone has been killed already

489
00:37:18,002 --> 00:37:19,902
I never thought he'd be killed first.

490
00:37:27,378 --> 00:37:28,902
The one hiding behind the door

491
00:37:29,247 --> 00:37:30,737
is the keeper of this boat.

492
00:37:32,350 --> 00:37:35,751
I want to know who's the officious one.

493
00:37:39,757 --> 00:37:40,883
This morning I found the boatsman...

494
00:37:41,058 --> 00:37:43,424
lying dead on the bed.

495
00:37:44,362 --> 00:37:47,559
Someone broke his artery last night.

496
00:37:48,566 --> 00:37:49,555
Even though he was a good boxer...

497
00:37:49,734 --> 00:37:51,429
he's killed by someone.

498
00:37:51,602 --> 00:37:52,626
Why not?

499
00:37:52,803 --> 00:37:55,738
Or else why did he die?

500
00:37:55,906 --> 00:37:59,433
I think there'll be more people here...

501
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:03,068
Help...

502
00:38:07,084 --> 00:38:07,880
Who killed them?

503
00:38:08,052 --> 00:38:08,711
I don't know.

504
00:38:08,919 --> 00:38:10,045
When I brought them meals,

505
00:38:10,388 --> 00:38:11,514
they're already dead on the ground.

506
00:38:11,689 --> 00:38:12,917
And 2 of them are standing there.

507
00:38:13,090 --> 00:38:14,751
We heard the sound of fighting...

508
00:38:14,925 --> 00:38:16,517
and came over.

509
00:38:20,431 --> 00:38:22,729
Did you see anyone going there?

510
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:23,867
No.

511
00:39:07,478 --> 00:39:08,410
Why do you want to kill me?

512
00:39:08,579 --> 00:39:10,410
To keep your mouth shut as you're the...

513
00:39:10,581 --> 00:39:11,707
only one who knows I killed the guard.

514
00:39:16,787 --> 00:39:17,515
You're wrong.

515
00:39:17,688 --> 00:39:18,347
When I came in this morning...

516
00:39:18,522 --> 00:39:19,682
and saw you standing there,

517
00:39:19,857 --> 00:39:20,755
I just suspected.

518
00:39:20,925 --> 00:39:23,416
Not until now did I realize
you're the killer.

519
00:39:36,807 --> 00:39:37,774
What's the matter?

520
00:39:37,975 --> 00:39:38,942
He wants to kill me.

521
00:39:39,110 --> 00:39:39,701
Why?

522
00:39:39,877 --> 00:39:40,969
You'd better ask him.

523
00:39:45,916 --> 00:39:46,575
What's going on?

524
00:39:46,751 --> 00:39:47,809
He killed someone.

525
00:40:00,498 --> 00:40:01,021
Strange.

526
00:40:01,198 --> 00:40:03,166
We just came up here from the cabin.

527
00:40:03,501 --> 00:40:04,559
Who killed him?

528
00:40:11,742 --> 00:40:14,734
Sir, are you still...

529
00:40:14,912 --> 00:40:16,174
going to kill to keep the secret?

530
00:40:16,914 --> 00:40:19,542
Why do you want to keep the secret?

531
00:40:19,717 --> 00:40:20,513
You're afraid he'd arrest you.

532
00:40:20,684 --> 00:40:21,412
Since the one who was killed...

533
00:40:21,585 --> 00:40:23,519
is a royal guard,

534
00:40:23,687 --> 00:40:27,521
and you're the well-known
Invisible Thief...

535
00:40:27,725 --> 00:40:30,922
who stole the Queen's pearl.

536
00:41:02,693 --> 00:41:04,490
What? One more person has been killed?

537
00:41:08,599 --> 00:41:10,829
Ought to be 1 more person here. But where?

538
00:41:11,001 --> 00:41:13,026
One more people? Who?

539
00:41:13,237 --> 00:41:16,570
The one who has killed the one in white...

540
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:19,265
and kills the old man now.

541
00:41:22,746 --> 00:41:25,180
Besides that person is a very good boxer.

542
00:41:25,516 --> 00:41:26,244
Where's he?

543
00:41:27,084 --> 00:41:28,676
Look...

544
00:41:41,832 --> 00:41:44,630
I know he's a very good boxer.

545
00:41:44,802 --> 00:41:47,794
He killed. No one could resist him.

546
00:41:49,607 --> 00:41:51,598
What? The boat owner wasn't dead yet.

547
00:41:51,775 --> 00:41:52,639
Not only that, but...

548
00:41:52,810 --> 00:41:54,243
the two men were killed by him.

549
00:41:54,612 --> 00:41:56,011
Right.

550
00:41:56,180 --> 00:42:00,082
By doing so, you'd overlook him...

551
00:42:00,284 --> 00:42:02,912
and it'd be the best way to kill.

552
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:04,280
Why did he try to kill us?

553
00:42:05,055 --> 00:42:09,185
Headquarter mentioned there're spies
on the boat

554
00:42:09,527 --> 00:42:10,619
Because the King has ordered...

555
00:42:10,794 --> 00:42:13,592
the best royal guard to

556
00:42:13,797 --> 00:42:16,265
arrest Mr. Bat.

557
00:42:16,634 --> 00:42:20,900
The officious Master Hsiang...

558
00:42:21,071 --> 00:42:23,096
is also on the boat.

559
00:42:24,341 --> 00:42:27,708
So the owner planned to kill...

560
00:42:27,878 --> 00:42:29,277
all people on the boat.

561
00:42:29,713 --> 00:42:31,237
Where's the boat owner now?

562
00:42:31,582 --> 00:42:33,311
As you guys found out the fact, he'd

563
00:42:33,651 --> 00:42:36,279
gone back to the Island on another boat.

564
00:42:36,620 --> 00:42:37,348
Bullshit.

565
00:43:48,092 --> 00:43:49,081
Xiang Feitian, you're wrong.

566
00:43:49,259 --> 00:43:50,851
How could you kill us all?

567
00:43:51,862 --> 00:43:53,659
Mr. Bat never...

568
00:43:53,831 --> 00:43:56,129
does things in a wrong way.

569
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:58,029
Don't you see the candle?

570
00:44:01,338 --> 00:44:02,999
What's wrong with it?

571
00:44:03,707 --> 00:44:05,402
When it's gone,

572
00:44:05,743 --> 00:44:07,711
the boat will be blown off...

573
00:44:07,878 --> 00:44:09,971
and you'll be dead in the sea.

574
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:37,466
Holy...!

575
00:44:37,808 --> 00:44:40,003
The dynamite must be under the candle.

576
00:45:52,850 --> 00:45:54,442
Hurry up. Go inside and help.

577
00:45:55,519 --> 00:45:56,918
Go inside quick.

578
00:46:07,564 --> 00:46:11,295
Hurry up.

579
00:46:32,956 --> 00:46:36,289
I never thought sitting and floating in...

580
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:38,860
a coffin would be
more relaxing than on a boat

581
00:46:41,465 --> 00:46:44,298
Yi Tien-hung,
we're in the middle of the sea

582
00:46:44,468 --> 00:46:47,028
The shore is out of sight. What'd we do?

583
00:46:47,204 --> 00:46:50,037
Did they prepare the coffin for you?

584
00:46:56,947 --> 00:47:00,849
The night sea breeze is really cool.

585
00:47:20,170 --> 00:47:22,070
There is a boat over there

586
00:47:28,312 --> 00:47:30,872
Why are the people drifting in the sea?

587
00:47:36,653 --> 00:47:39,144
Sir, there're many people drifting...

588
00:47:39,323 --> 00:47:41,188
in coffins.

589
00:47:41,358 --> 00:47:44,156
Then save them immediately.

590
00:47:47,497 --> 00:47:49,624
Put the rope down.

591
00:48:03,080 --> 00:48:04,479
Please...

592
00:48:06,049 --> 00:48:07,448
Please

593
00:48:17,394 --> 00:48:21,592
Please forgive my ignorance.

594
00:48:23,433 --> 00:48:26,197
Not at all. Thanks for saving us.

595
00:48:26,370 --> 00:48:29,965
We'll feel embarrassed...

596
00:48:31,174 --> 00:48:33,165
if you still blame yourself.

597
00:48:33,911 --> 00:48:36,675
It's my honor...

598
00:48:37,014 --> 00:48:38,208
to be of little help to you.

599
00:48:38,382 --> 00:48:40,373
Please make yourself comfortable.

600
00:48:40,550 --> 00:48:43,018
Sir, the meal is served

601
00:48:43,453 --> 00:48:47,583
Please be seated

602
00:48:47,925 --> 00:48:50,257
Young master became blind
when he was small

603
00:48:50,427 --> 00:48:54,022
Do forgive us for any mistake
due to oversight

604
00:48:54,197 --> 00:48:58,395
Ladies and gentlemen, I'd like to...

605
00:48:58,568 --> 00:49:01,230
drink first to show my respects

606
00:49:02,306 --> 00:49:03,967
Please...

607
00:49:08,178 --> 00:49:10,408
I know Master Hsiang is a wine conossieur

608
00:49:10,580 --> 00:49:13,674
Is the wine good enough for you?

609
00:49:17,721 --> 00:49:19,450
How do you know he's Chu Liu-hsiang?

610
00:49:19,623 --> 00:49:21,716
I was informed of 5 people
getting off the boat.

611
00:49:22,059 --> 00:49:24,050
But I only heard footsteps of four

612
00:49:24,227 --> 00:49:26,252
In the boxers' world, only Master Hsiang...

613
00:49:26,430 --> 00:49:29,126
can land without making a sound.

614
00:49:30,434 --> 00:49:32,265
To kill with ease...

615
00:49:32,436 --> 00:49:33,596
Yi Tien-hung

616
00:49:33,770 --> 00:49:36,000
I raise a toast to you.

617
00:49:37,541 --> 00:49:39,736
How do you know he's Yi Tien-hung?

618
00:49:40,077 --> 00:49:42,307
The 2 heroes busting the Holy Water Palace

619
00:49:42,479 --> 00:49:43,776
Can anyone not be shocked by it?

620
00:49:44,114 --> 00:49:46,139
To walk and sit side by side with Hsiang

621
00:49:46,316 --> 00:49:48,409
It must be the Hero Yi Tien-hung.

622
00:49:48,618 --> 00:49:49,550
Please

623
00:49:54,791 --> 00:49:56,782
Though your eye-sight isn't very good,

624
00:49:57,127 --> 00:49:59,687
you do see much better than many of us.

625
00:50:00,030 --> 00:50:03,522
Thanks. The others are...

626
00:50:03,700 --> 00:50:07,602
- I'm Jin Linzhi.
- I'm Gou Zicheng.

627
00:50:08,638 --> 00:50:10,799
Mr. Gou and Miss Jin, please...

628
00:50:11,141 --> 00:50:12,073
Please...

629
00:50:16,146 --> 00:50:20,082
Why did you drift in the sea?

630
00:50:21,418 --> 00:50:22,248
A long story...

631
00:50:22,452 --> 00:50:24,682
our boat had an accident.

632
00:50:25,155 --> 00:50:26,452
Right. I'd have asked...

633
00:50:26,656 --> 00:50:28,624
how I should address you.

634
00:50:28,825 --> 00:50:31,350
I'm Yuan suiyun.

635
00:50:32,029 --> 00:50:34,088
Your surname isn't a common one.

636
00:50:34,264 --> 00:50:36,198
Where's your hometown?

637
00:50:36,366 --> 00:50:37,628
I come from Guanzhong.

638
00:50:38,335 --> 00:50:41,099
It's a famous boxer's family.

639
00:50:41,304 --> 00:50:44,273
Wuzheng villa is also the biggest villa.

640
00:50:44,474 --> 00:50:45,839
I wonder if Master Yuan...

641
00:50:46,176 --> 00:50:47,074
is from your family?

642
00:50:47,244 --> 00:50:48,643
He's my father.

643
00:50:53,316 --> 00:50:57,116
He's not only a very rich man, but also<i>...</i>

644
00:50:57,287 --> 00:50:59,346
a reputed man in the boxers' world.

645
00:50:59,523 --> 00:51:01,753
The title of his villa was given...

646
00:51:02,092 --> 00:51:04,424
by other famous boxers

647
00:51:04,594 --> 00:51:05,526
It meant among the boxers,

648
00:51:05,695 --> 00:51:08,289
no one can compare to him.

649
00:51:08,465 --> 00:51:10,365
Is he really skillful at fighting?

650
00:51:10,534 --> 00:51:13,230
But he passed away 3 years ago.

651
00:51:13,570 --> 00:51:15,504
I heard this young master...

652
00:51:15,672 --> 00:51:17,435
has been a genius since he's a child.

653
00:51:17,607 --> 00:51:19,404
He's good at fighting and also at academics

654
00:51:19,576 --> 00:51:21,601
And he's of a generous character.

655
00:51:22,212 --> 00:51:23,270
The boxers' world said...

656
00:51:23,447 --> 00:51:26,109
Master Fumei of Huashan school is a hermit

657
00:51:26,283 --> 00:51:28,774
But she and Mr. Yuan of Wuzheng villa...

658
00:51:29,119 --> 00:51:31,314
had two sons.

659
00:51:31,488 --> 00:51:33,319
Right. Master Fumei...

660
00:51:33,490 --> 00:51:35,117
and Mr. Yuan are proud parents of 2 boys.

661
00:51:35,292 --> 00:51:36,816
Fumei took away the elder son.

662
00:51:37,160 --> 00:51:38,787
The younger one was left to Yuan.

663
00:51:39,262 --> 00:51:41,230
What's the trouble between them?

664
00:51:41,398 --> 00:51:43,696
Women are always unreasonable.

665
00:51:46,203 --> 00:51:47,135
Come in

666
00:51:49,739 --> 00:51:51,730
My lord invites you
to partake refreshments...

667
00:51:51,908 --> 00:51:53,398
on the deck.

668
00:51:53,577 --> 00:51:54,407
Thanks.

669
00:51:54,578 --> 00:51:55,670
Please...

670
00:52:01,718 --> 00:52:03,117
Please...

671
00:52:08,325 --> 00:52:09,292
The meal is here.

672
00:52:11,394 --> 00:52:12,520
Thanks

673
00:52:14,664 --> 00:52:15,926
Master Fumei...

674
00:52:16,266 --> 00:52:17,893
strange. Didn't they...

675
00:52:18,235 --> 00:52:20,863
drown at the Qinhuai River?

676
00:52:21,204 --> 00:52:22,466
How come they are here?

677
00:52:24,441 --> 00:52:27,433
As such this already is a strange boat

678
00:52:27,811 --> 00:52:29,244
Let's have the meals first.

679
00:52:55,539 --> 00:52:56,471
The guests I serve give me trouble.

680
00:52:56,640 --> 00:52:57,800
They've several meals a day.

681
00:52:57,974 --> 00:53:00,272
Mine too. She takes medicine very often.

682
00:53:00,443 --> 00:53:02,741
I know the poppy is very expensive.

683
00:53:02,913 --> 00:53:04,210
It's only from India.

684
00:53:04,381 --> 00:53:05,177
Yes.

685
00:53:09,486 --> 00:53:10,783
Here's your medicine.

686
00:53:10,954 --> 00:53:11,784
Thanks.

687
00:53:22,265 --> 00:53:23,232
Let's have the meal first.

688
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:24,424
Come on.

689
00:53:25,569 --> 00:53:26,593
Was he the man in white who...

690
00:53:26,770 --> 00:53:28,635
Iost his memory at the simin villa?

691
00:53:28,805 --> 00:53:30,864
Strange. Why is he here?

692
00:53:31,208 --> 00:53:32,436
Don't move and make no sound.

693
00:53:33,610 --> 00:53:37,341
It's you. Did you see that?

694
00:53:38,248 --> 00:53:39,772
Follow me.

695
00:54:02,505 --> 00:54:06,566
Mr. And Mrs. Li, Master Fumei,

696
00:54:06,743 --> 00:54:08,438
the Man in White and Dingfeng.

697
00:54:08,612 --> 00:54:10,341
What are they doing on the boat?

698
00:54:11,014 --> 00:54:12,276
Didn't you think...

699
00:54:12,449 --> 00:54:15,247
they're going to Bat Island on this boat?

700
00:54:15,518 --> 00:54:17,042
Is this boat going to Bat Island?

701
00:54:17,387 --> 00:54:18,513
How can it?

702
00:54:18,688 --> 00:54:21,680
Wucheng villa is a reputed family.

703
00:54:21,858 --> 00:54:23,519
What are they doing at Bat Island?

704
00:54:23,693 --> 00:54:26,059
The young master Yuan...

705
00:54:26,396 --> 00:54:29,024
was threatened by the one in white hair

706
00:54:29,399 --> 00:54:32,425
The boat will go to Bat Island definitely

707
00:54:32,602 --> 00:54:36,333
The boat is heading towards Carp Island.

708
00:54:36,606 --> 00:54:39,336
Strange. Who the hell are you?

709
00:54:39,509 --> 00:54:40,635
Why do you know each & every detail...

710
00:54:40,810 --> 00:54:42,437
of everything?

711
00:54:42,612 --> 00:54:45,672
I'm me, a person heading for Bat Island.

712
00:54:46,416 --> 00:54:47,747
Look like, at last...

713
00:54:47,917 --> 00:54:49,714
we'll be going to Bat Island

714
00:54:49,886 --> 00:54:51,012
since we can only find the answers

715
00:54:51,388 --> 00:54:54,016
for our questions there.

716
00:54:54,524 --> 00:54:57,721
But this boat will go to Carp Island first

717
00:55:07,937 --> 00:55:10,838
sir, we find the golden carps here.

718
00:55:11,741 --> 00:55:13,003
Then get it up now.

719
00:55:13,343 --> 00:55:14,037
Yes.

720
00:55:15,645 --> 00:55:18,512
It can be only found near Carp Island.

721
00:55:18,682 --> 00:55:20,047
It tastes very good.

722
00:55:20,417 --> 00:55:23,352
That's the reason I've brought my boat here

723
00:55:23,687 --> 00:55:25,587
The fish is coming.

724
00:55:25,755 --> 00:55:30,715
Hurry up.

725
00:55:33,763 --> 00:55:34,752
How come it's a man?

726
00:55:35,065 --> 00:55:36,726
Sir, we fished...

727
00:55:36,933 --> 00:55:38,594
4 naked women.

728
00:55:38,868 --> 00:55:40,529
Dead or alive?

729
00:55:54,451 --> 00:55:55,816
They don't have any breath,

730
00:55:55,985 --> 00:55:57,384
but their hearts are still beating.

731
00:55:57,554 --> 00:55:58,987
Maybe they've just passed out

732
00:55:59,155 --> 00:56:00,850
Get them to Tian room now.

733
00:56:01,024 --> 00:56:02,082
Ask Mrs. Nan to go there.

734
00:56:02,459 --> 00:56:03,426
Yes

735
00:56:03,793 --> 00:56:06,489
Where do they come from?

736
00:56:06,663 --> 00:56:08,790
How could they get into the net?

737
00:56:12,469 --> 00:56:13,993
Hurry up. Get them into the room.

738
00:56:19,876 --> 00:56:22,811
Madam, their heartbeats have stopped.

739
00:56:22,979 --> 00:56:25,607
Sir asked you to save them immediately.

740
00:56:25,815 --> 00:56:28,784
Get out... immediately.

741
00:56:33,590 --> 00:56:35,148
What the hell are they doing?

742
00:56:42,399 --> 00:56:46,802
Master...

743
00:56:46,970 --> 00:56:48,164
sir, big trouble!

744
00:56:48,538 --> 00:56:50,836
The 4 girls killed madam.

745
00:56:51,007 --> 00:56:51,905
What?

746
00:56:55,812 --> 00:56:57,143
The Heart Pluck Hand!

747
00:56:57,480 --> 00:57:00,449
True, Master killed them before she died.

748
00:57:00,817 --> 00:57:02,114
Who are these girls?

749
00:57:02,452 --> 00:57:03,146
I don't know.

750
00:57:03,620 --> 00:57:04,917
Master Hsiang, do you know?

751
00:57:06,089 --> 00:57:07,181
I don't know.

752
00:57:07,557 --> 00:57:09,889
Someone ordered them to kill the master

753
00:57:10,026 --> 00:57:11,516
The one must be a very good fighter,

754
00:57:11,694 --> 00:57:15,721
and a powerful man.

755
00:57:16,032 --> 00:57:17,727
From Bat Island?

756
00:57:18,435 --> 00:57:19,766
We're heading there right now.

757
00:57:24,808 --> 00:57:26,639
We must not go to bed tonight.

758
00:57:42,459 --> 00:57:44,552
I need to unlock 6 body points.

759
00:57:50,700 --> 00:57:52,190
Don't move. I'm here to save you.

760
00:57:52,569 --> 00:57:53,467
Who asked you to come?

761
00:57:53,636 --> 00:57:55,866
Your mother, Master Fumei.

762
00:57:57,273 --> 00:58:00,140
How do you know I'm his son?

763
00:58:00,477 --> 00:58:02,707
I happen to be her student Gao Yanan.

764
00:58:03,813 --> 00:58:05,872
Follow me to the small boat over there.

765
00:58:23,600 --> 00:58:24,794
Master Hsiang, something is wrong.

766
00:58:24,968 --> 00:58:26,128
Our boat has stopped.

767
00:58:26,603 --> 00:58:27,535
Run.

768
00:58:30,874 --> 00:58:32,034
The boat is in a cave.

769
00:58:32,208 --> 00:58:32,765
Hurry. Go up and look

770
00:58:32,942 --> 00:58:34,000
No need. I've been there.

771
00:58:34,177 --> 00:58:35,235
No one is there.

772
00:58:38,281 --> 00:58:38,975
No need to go down.

773
00:58:39,148 --> 00:58:40,513
No one's down there.

774
00:58:52,295 --> 00:58:53,193
Mr. And Mrs. Li aren't there.

775
00:58:53,530 --> 00:58:54,326
No one's in the house.

776
00:58:54,664 --> 00:58:56,131
The body of Master Fumei is also gone.

777
00:58:56,299 --> 00:58:57,732
Where's Mr. Yuan?

778
00:59:07,343 --> 00:59:08,742
Stop. It's a friend.

779
00:59:09,045 --> 00:59:10,945
Mr. Li, we're looking for you.

780
00:59:11,114 --> 00:59:11,978
Why are you here?

781
00:59:12,148 --> 00:59:13,740
Mr. Yuan of Wuchang villa...

782
00:59:13,950 --> 00:59:16,077
invited us to the Carp Island.

783
00:59:16,252 --> 00:59:18,948
But she felt sick once boarding the boat

784
00:59:19,122 --> 00:59:21,613
We didn't leave the cabin at all.

785
00:59:21,824 --> 00:59:23,553
You didn't know we're on the boat.

786
00:59:23,726 --> 00:59:25,250
I knew many friends boarding the boat,

787
00:59:25,595 --> 00:59:26,687
but I didn't know it's you.

788
00:59:26,863 --> 00:59:28,694
Where is Mr. Yuan?

789
00:59:28,865 --> 00:59:29,854
Have no idea

790
00:59:29,999 --> 00:59:31,864
When I noticed that the boat has stopped,

791
00:59:32,035 --> 00:59:32,933
he wasn't there anymore.

792
00:59:33,102 --> 00:59:35,332
Did the one in red take him away?

793
01:00:06,736 --> 01:00:08,601
The drug is really strong.

794
01:00:08,771 --> 01:00:12,332
Even I with a stuffy nose have passed out.

795
01:00:21,918 --> 01:00:23,010
What is this place?

796
01:00:23,386 --> 01:00:24,148
When we woke up,

797
01:00:24,320 --> 01:00:25,787
we're already hung here.

798
01:00:26,389 --> 01:00:27,378
There's a Black Iron

799
01:00:27,757 --> 01:00:29,622
which is the hardest thing in the world

800
01:00:29,792 --> 01:00:31,692
No matter how powerful you are,

801
01:00:31,894 --> 01:00:33,691
you can't break it.

802
01:00:37,233 --> 01:00:38,200
Look...

803
01:01:05,928 --> 01:01:07,862
Look at this valley

804
01:01:08,031 --> 01:01:10,659
there's only a single door out.

805
01:01:10,833 --> 01:01:12,960
Let's think of a way out of this cage.

806
01:01:18,274 --> 01:01:21,107
We've a Gold sword at Jade villa.

807
01:01:21,277 --> 01:01:22,904
It can break iron like paper.

808
01:01:23,112 --> 01:01:26,240
I wonder if it could
break this Black Iron too

809
01:01:35,458 --> 01:01:37,949
We now get into the water and swim there

810
01:01:38,127 --> 01:01:38,957
Hold it.

811
01:01:39,429 --> 01:01:40,896
Mr. Bat won't use only a...

812
01:01:41,064 --> 01:01:42,326
cage made of Black Iron

813
01:01:42,498 --> 01:01:44,466
to trap the reputed Master Hsiang

814
01:01:44,801 --> 01:01:46,132
and Yi Tien-hung.

815
01:01:46,369 --> 01:01:48,200
I know of a certain kind of acid...

816
01:01:48,371 --> 01:01:50,430
that can melt anything.

817
01:01:50,807 --> 01:01:53,503
I'm afraid this is an acid pool.

818
01:02:02,218 --> 01:02:03,207
Yes, it's an acid pool.

819
01:02:03,386 --> 01:02:05,718
How can I get to the exit?

820
01:02:08,458 --> 01:02:10,153
There's a fire over there.

821
01:02:10,326 --> 01:02:12,317
We can climb over there,

822
01:02:12,495 --> 01:02:14,463
but Miss Jin mightn't be able to do it.

823
01:02:14,797 --> 01:02:17,027
There's only one way out.

824
01:02:17,200 --> 01:02:19,828
It'll be like hanging food one by one.

825
01:02:21,104 --> 01:02:22,401
Only food could be hung on the wire!

826
01:02:22,739 --> 01:02:24,263
Would the wire bear the weight of people?

827
01:02:27,543 --> 01:02:29,135
I've here the Magic silk Wire,

828
01:02:29,312 --> 01:02:31,337
the most pliable but strongest material

829
01:02:31,514 --> 01:02:33,345
I tighten it on this precious blade...

830
01:02:33,516 --> 01:02:35,143
and fling it there.

831
01:02:35,318 --> 01:02:37,252
So we may climb on it to reach there.

832
01:02:39,021 --> 01:02:40,215
Was this wire the ancient treasure...

833
01:02:40,389 --> 01:02:42,186
used by Master Tianyi

834
01:02:42,358 --> 01:02:45,191
at the last Huashan Meeting?

835
01:02:45,361 --> 01:02:46,828
How could you know?

836
01:02:46,996 --> 01:02:49,260
I also know that this wire belongs to...

837
01:02:49,432 --> 01:02:52,458
the top royal guard now.

838
01:02:53,302 --> 01:02:55,497
I presume you're not Gao Zicheng,

839
01:02:55,838 --> 01:02:59,865
but the top royal guard ou Zhancheng.

840
01:03:00,042 --> 01:03:01,839
How can you know all details?

841
01:03:02,011 --> 01:03:04,809
Because I was paid to kill a royal...

842
01:03:04,981 --> 01:03:08,576
guard who carries the Magic Wire.

843
01:03:13,156 --> 01:03:14,350
Are you really a man...

844
01:03:14,524 --> 01:03:16,116
who will do anything for money?

845
01:03:18,394 --> 01:03:22,387
I was and I will be.

846
01:03:23,366 --> 01:03:25,334
Maybe not today.

847
01:03:25,501 --> 01:03:29,335
But don't forget; I'll kill you anytime.

848
01:03:45,521 --> 01:03:46,215
Okay?

849
01:03:46,389 --> 01:03:47,287
Okay

850
01:03:47,857 --> 01:03:49,916
Is this strong enough?

851
01:03:50,092 --> 01:03:51,218
Yes, but I'm afraid...

852
01:03:51,427 --> 01:03:54,225
the blade didn't stick deep enough.

853
01:03:54,430 --> 01:03:57,126
Master Hsiang, if I fall,

854
01:03:57,300 --> 01:03:58,267
you think of another way.

855
01:03:58,868 --> 01:04:00,961
Mr. Ou, let me go first.

856
01:04:01,137 --> 01:04:03,401
No, the wire is mine.

857
01:05:09,205 --> 01:05:10,467
Now you guys may come up here.

858
01:05:11,140 --> 01:05:13,131
Mr. Li and Mrs. Li, please...

859
01:05:16,012 --> 01:05:17,104
Wumin...

860
01:06:11,367 --> 01:06:12,334
Miss Jin, please...

861
01:06:12,535 --> 01:06:14,196
No, I'm scared.

862
01:06:19,275 --> 01:06:20,333
The wire is so thin...

863
01:06:20,543 --> 01:06:22,101
one on another. Very hard to keep balance

864
01:06:22,278 --> 01:06:23,267
Let me help you.

865
01:06:25,681 --> 01:06:27,649
Mrs. Li, please look if someone is outside.

866
01:07:22,038 --> 01:07:24,063
Hold tight and give him your hand.

867
01:07:28,177 --> 01:07:30,702
Yi Tien-hung. Get her.

868
01:07:31,047 --> 01:07:31,843
Got it.

869
01:07:48,197 --> 01:07:49,391
Be careful. No need to fear.

870
01:07:51,434 --> 01:07:54,335
Be careful. Take it slowly.

871
01:08:29,605 --> 01:08:31,630
Maybe not today.

872
01:08:31,841 --> 01:08:35,504
But don't forget. I'll kill you anytime.

873
01:08:46,222 --> 01:08:48,622
Okay. We're all over here.

874
01:08:48,791 --> 01:08:50,156
You take the wire back now.

875
01:08:50,326 --> 01:08:51,315
Let's go outside.

876
01:09:26,595 --> 01:09:28,495
Tell me. Where are the prisoners?

877
01:09:34,470 --> 01:09:35,198
This is the prison?

878
01:09:35,371 --> 01:09:36,338
Yes.

879
01:09:41,610 --> 01:09:42,474
Go.

880
01:09:45,848 --> 01:09:46,872
Why is no one here?

881
01:09:47,216 --> 01:09:48,274
Did the guard lie to us?

882
01:09:48,484 --> 01:09:50,509
No. My dad usually constructs...

883
01:09:50,686 --> 01:09:52,347
according to Eight Diagrams

884
01:09:52,521 --> 01:09:53,852
...and constellation.

885
01:09:54,190 --> 01:09:54,849
If I'm not wrong,

886
01:09:55,191 --> 01:09:56,590
there'll be a trap inside.

887
01:09:57,927 --> 01:09:58,916
This is the door of life

888
01:10:03,532 --> 01:10:06,501
Dad? Where are you?

889
01:10:08,637 --> 01:10:09,899
Linzhi...

890
01:10:10,406 --> 01:10:11,600
Dad...

891
01:10:28,424 --> 01:10:28,947
Lord...

892
01:10:29,291 --> 01:10:30,952
something happened in the prison.

893
01:10:31,994 --> 01:10:33,655
Is the safety gate on?

894
01:10:33,829 --> 01:10:35,023
It's on already.

895
01:10:35,998 --> 01:10:37,363
It's all right then

896
01:10:37,666 --> 01:10:39,793
Let's finish them after the auction.

897
01:10:39,969 --> 01:10:40,901
Yes.

898
01:10:42,504 --> 01:10:43,732
Hurry up.

899
01:10:43,906 --> 01:10:47,967
Don't run... It's dangerous ahead.

900
01:10:48,344 --> 01:10:49,675
It's an abyss.

901
01:10:49,845 --> 01:10:50,937
Don't run in disorder

902
01:10:51,380 --> 01:10:52,312
How can we get out of here?

903
01:10:52,514 --> 01:10:53,845
It's a cave there.

904
01:10:54,016 --> 01:10:55,347
It's the only exit.

905
01:10:55,517 --> 01:10:56,984
It leads to the seaside.

906
01:10:57,353 --> 01:10:58,877
You get out of here yourself.

907
01:11:01,056 --> 01:11:03,024
Walk slowly. Don't fall.

908
01:11:04,627 --> 01:11:06,060
Kid, let's go.

909
01:11:06,462 --> 01:11:08,487
Hold it, sir.

910
01:11:08,697 --> 01:11:09,823
Please show me the way to...

911
01:11:09,999 --> 01:11:11,626
the Bat Hall.

912
01:11:11,867 --> 01:11:13,266
Why are you going there?

913
01:11:13,435 --> 01:11:15,460
Because I need to catch Mr. Bat.

914
01:11:15,871 --> 01:11:17,634
I've also promised my friend that I need...

915
01:11:17,806 --> 01:11:19,068
to buy medicine for him.

916
01:11:19,575 --> 01:11:21,839
I've never been caught by anyone.

917
01:11:22,011 --> 01:11:24,036
I'm curious as to who'd want to catch me.

918
01:11:25,714 --> 01:11:27,443
And you?

919
01:11:29,518 --> 01:11:31,577
It is a rule of Jade villa.

920
01:11:31,754 --> 01:11:33,779
If our friends are...

921
01:11:33,956 --> 01:11:35,355
in danger,

922
01:11:35,524 --> 01:11:36,923
we can't leave them alone.

923
01:11:37,526 --> 01:11:38,857
The road is dangerous.

924
01:11:39,028 --> 01:11:40,017
Why?

925
01:11:40,362 --> 01:11:42,296
When I built this Bat Road,

926
01:11:42,464 --> 01:11:43,829
I had looked through the place.

927
01:11:43,999 --> 01:11:45,694
These caves are dangerous.

928
01:11:45,868 --> 01:11:48,564
Either abysses or black oil grounds

929
01:11:48,771 --> 01:11:50,466
Look at the fire.

930
01:11:50,639 --> 01:11:52,607
It's burnt from the black oil.

931
01:11:52,775 --> 01:11:54,037
You've to pass through these...

932
01:11:54,410 --> 01:11:56,105
dead caves to the Bat Hall.

933
01:11:56,445 --> 01:11:57,912
Maybe...

934
01:11:58,113 --> 01:11:59,410
all of us will die and

935
01:11:59,581 --> 01:12:01,014
can't make to the Hall.

936
01:12:02,518 --> 01:12:04,383
Tell me the way.

937
01:12:04,553 --> 01:12:05,520
I'll go there alone.

938
01:12:05,688 --> 01:12:07,883
No. Let's go together.

939
01:12:09,925 --> 01:12:11,984
You've saved my life.

940
01:12:12,328 --> 01:12:13,989
I'm going too.

941
01:12:35,617 --> 01:12:36,948
Come with me.

942
01:12:48,897 --> 01:12:52,560
I never expected it to burn to the end

943
01:12:52,735 --> 01:12:54,362
What is it?

944
01:12:54,737 --> 01:12:57,365
The Black oils are all over the place,

945
01:12:57,539 --> 01:12:59,530
especially in this cave.

946
01:13:00,542 --> 01:13:01,941
When will this fire be put out?

947
01:13:02,111 --> 01:13:03,100
The Black oil comes out endlessly.

948
01:13:03,479 --> 01:13:05,037
It'll never be put out.

949
01:13:05,481 --> 01:13:07,847
Another way to go?

950
01:13:08,016 --> 01:13:13,579
No. I designed these caves.

951
01:13:13,789 --> 01:13:17,520
Do you see the red rock?

952
01:13:18,694 --> 01:13:20,787
I put it there.

953
01:13:20,996 --> 01:13:23,464
This is the only way to Bat Hall.

954
01:13:23,632 --> 01:13:26,123
Take the red rock out and climb over.

955
01:13:26,502 --> 01:13:28,163
How can we pass through the broad fire?

956
01:13:28,537 --> 01:13:29,060
On both sides of the cave,

957
01:13:29,405 --> 01:13:30,429
there's no space to step on.

958
01:13:30,639 --> 01:13:31,503
It's no use even if you can step on it.

959
01:13:31,673 --> 01:13:32,571
The fire burns so fiercely...

960
01:13:32,741 --> 01:13:34,208
The rock must be hot like hell.

961
01:13:34,710 --> 01:13:36,735
Sir, I must go over there.

962
01:13:39,448 --> 01:13:42,440
There's only one way.

963
01:13:42,651 --> 01:13:44,585
Someone goes down and blocks the...

964
01:13:44,753 --> 01:13:46,687
Black oil from the hole.

965
01:13:46,855 --> 01:13:49,016
But the one...

966
01:13:53,562 --> 01:13:56,588
Mr. Bat is the bane of the boxers' world

967
01:13:57,132 --> 01:13:59,430
I created these wrong things.

968
01:13:59,601 --> 01:14:01,592
It should have been me to go down.

969
01:14:01,770 --> 01:14:02,964
But if I died,

970
01:14:03,138 --> 01:14:05,732
no one could show you the way.

971
01:14:06,708 --> 01:14:08,175
Linzhi doesn't know martial art.

972
01:14:08,510 --> 01:14:11,809
She's not able to find the hole.

973
01:14:11,980 --> 01:14:17,043
So it'd be wrong of me to ask you to go.

974
01:14:17,219 --> 01:14:18,516
No, sir

975
01:14:18,720 --> 01:14:20,210
Let me do it

976
01:14:20,989 --> 01:14:25,085
No need. He brought me up.

977
01:14:25,260 --> 01:14:27,228
This is my Jin family's business.

978
01:14:27,563 --> 01:14:28,791
Let me do it.

979
01:14:29,865 --> 01:14:31,127
Mute buddy

980
01:14:58,293 --> 01:15:02,559
God bless you.

981
01:15:44,306 --> 01:15:46,206
What's your name? I'll tell the King...

982
01:15:46,542 --> 01:15:49,102
who will give you credit.

983
01:15:53,582 --> 01:15:57,245
The cave is right under the red rock.

984
01:16:35,724 --> 01:16:39,216
- Brother Mute...
- Linzhi...

985
01:17:19,968 --> 01:17:23,131
I never thought it'd again be a dead-end

986
01:17:23,305 --> 01:17:24,738
Why?

987
01:17:25,407 --> 01:17:29,741
Do you see the 2 ice pillars there?

988
01:17:30,445 --> 01:17:33,846
3 years ago, I tried to blow a hole...

989
01:17:34,016 --> 01:17:36,280
to escape from here.

990
01:17:36,451 --> 01:17:38,919
The day when I was going to blow it,

991
01:17:39,121 --> 01:17:40,884
they caught me.

992
01:17:41,790 --> 01:17:43,382
Later I thought

993
01:17:43,759 --> 01:17:46,284
other prisoners had blown it.

994
01:17:46,928 --> 01:17:49,453
I never imagined
they wouldn't have done it

995
01:17:49,798 --> 01:17:50,730
sir...

996
01:17:50,899 --> 01:17:53,197
We got no way to the Hall.

997
01:17:53,468 --> 01:17:57,097
We've to make our way back.

998
01:17:57,272 --> 01:18:00,298
Where's the dynamite you placed?

999
01:18:18,493 --> 01:18:23,760
Good... it's still there.

1000
01:18:27,135 --> 01:18:28,693
The fuse is gone though

1001
01:18:30,906 --> 01:18:33,340
We could use our clothes.

1002
01:18:33,508 --> 01:18:36,841
The icy air here is humid.

1003
01:18:37,012 --> 01:18:41,779
Ordinary clothes can't make it.

1004
01:18:42,851 --> 01:18:43,875
What can I do?

1005
01:18:45,887 --> 01:18:49,448
Only one way. Using a person as the lead.

1006
01:18:51,059 --> 01:18:52,526
And we need two

1007
01:18:52,861 --> 01:18:54,385
I've figured it out.

1008
01:18:54,730 --> 01:18:57,164
There're two strength points in this cave

1009
01:18:57,766 --> 01:18:58,790
Look...

1010
01:18:59,134 --> 01:19:02,729
Right under the two ice pillars.

1011
01:19:02,904 --> 01:19:07,932
To blow off the cave, the 2 dynamites...

1012
01:19:08,110 --> 01:19:10,305
must set off at the same time.

1013
01:19:10,479 --> 01:19:14,313
But when it sets off, these two people...

1014
01:19:29,464 --> 01:19:32,399
Master Hsiang, can you get my daughter...

1015
01:19:32,567 --> 01:19:35,400
and me to the ice pillars?

1016
01:19:49,084 --> 01:19:54,215
First, you've to be well versed
in martial arts

1017
01:19:54,389 --> 01:19:58,553
second, to go to the Bat Hall...

1018
01:19:58,894 --> 01:20:01,021
is what all five of us intend to do.

1019
01:20:01,196 --> 01:20:02,788
Nothing to you two.

1020
01:20:04,466 --> 01:20:08,402
5 sticks here. 2 short and 3 long.

1021
01:20:08,570 --> 01:20:12,267
One who picks the long one will light fire.

1022
01:20:15,076 --> 01:20:16,134
Me first.

1023
01:20:38,633 --> 01:20:42,194
Mine is short and yours is long.

1024
01:20:43,939 --> 01:20:49,002
Yours is short too. Why?

1025
01:20:49,177 --> 01:20:50,872
Because I'm a royal guard.

1026
01:20:51,079 --> 01:20:52,876
To fight crimes is my duty.

1027
01:20:53,048 --> 01:20:56,245
I must be one of them.

1028
01:20:57,886 --> 01:21:00,878
But after I've died,

1029
01:21:01,056 --> 01:21:03,923
please do a favour for me.

1030
01:21:04,125 --> 01:21:06,059
Use this silk Wire to...

1031
01:21:06,228 --> 01:21:09,095
tie Mr. Bat up for the King.

1032
01:21:18,173 --> 01:21:20,266
Why me?

1033
01:21:20,442 --> 01:21:22,433
You know I'll do it only for money

1034
01:21:22,611 --> 01:21:25,307
That's why. I want to let you know...

1035
01:21:25,480 --> 01:21:27,607
apart from money, you've got to do...

1036
01:21:27,949 --> 01:21:31,282
things for other reasons as well

1037
01:21:31,887 --> 01:21:35,516
This is the last request of my life.

1038
01:21:37,692 --> 01:21:39,956
This world is so strange!

1039
01:21:40,128 --> 01:21:44,258
I came here because I was to kill you.

1040
01:21:44,666 --> 01:21:46,190
That's life.

1041
01:21:46,368 --> 01:21:47,630
The feelings between people change...

1042
01:21:47,969 --> 01:21:49,493
in accordance with different situations

1043
01:21:49,704 --> 01:21:51,501
But you've to promise me

1044
01:21:51,673 --> 01:21:54,141
use the silk Wire to tie Mr. Bat up.

1045
01:21:59,047 --> 01:22:00,605
Who's the other one?

1046
01:22:13,628 --> 01:22:15,357
Yuhan, you must stay alive.

1047
01:22:15,530 --> 01:22:17,122
We're not going to the Hall.

1048
01:22:17,299 --> 01:22:19,324
Let's head back.

1049
01:22:19,734 --> 01:22:21,133
Wumin...

1050
01:22:22,170 --> 01:22:24,434
Just now we said that...

1051
01:22:24,606 --> 01:22:26,369
the people of Jade villa will stay

1052
01:22:26,541 --> 01:22:28,202
with friends forever.

1053
01:22:28,610 --> 01:22:31,636
But you're the only son for 3 generations

1054
01:22:31,980 --> 01:22:34,141
You can't die here.

1055
01:22:35,984 --> 01:22:38,145
If so, it's destined...

1056
01:22:38,320 --> 01:22:39,719
that my family will be ended here.

1057
01:22:41,489 --> 01:22:43,116
Don't come over.

1058
01:22:43,291 --> 01:22:45,225
This concerns Jade villa.

1059
01:22:45,560 --> 01:22:48,393
Why do you hit my points?

1060
01:22:48,563 --> 01:22:52,363
Yuhan, when I was seriously sick,

1061
01:22:52,567 --> 01:22:55,127
did you say you'll agree with...

1062
01:22:55,303 --> 01:22:56,497
whatever I do?

1063
01:22:56,671 --> 01:22:57,603
Yes.

1064
01:22:59,975 --> 01:23:02,136
I'll light the fire for you.

1065
01:23:11,720 --> 01:23:12,982
Sir...

1066
01:23:13,154 --> 01:23:14,678
When we blow off the cave,

1067
01:23:15,023 --> 01:23:16,354
You hit them at the 5th joint of...

1068
01:23:16,524 --> 01:23:18,583
their backbones

1069
01:23:18,793 --> 01:23:20,784
and they'll be able to move again.

1070
01:23:21,262 --> 01:23:22,695
I know

1071
01:23:32,474 --> 01:23:36,001
Mrs. Li,
do you have any words for your spouse?

1072
01:23:43,685 --> 01:23:44,811
No

1073
01:23:45,787 --> 01:23:48,620
Mrs. Li, please...

1074
01:23:49,791 --> 01:23:51,053
Mr. Ou, please...

1075
01:24:06,541 --> 01:24:09,533
The people will appreciate your sacrifice

1076
01:24:12,814 --> 01:24:14,281
I'm going

1077
01:25:03,598 --> 01:25:04,622
Follow me.

1078
01:25:10,672 --> 01:25:11,900
Mr. Li...

1079
01:25:33,761 --> 01:25:34,887
The hand of Master Xinghu is the next.

1080
01:25:35,230 --> 01:25:36,219
The head of the governor of 8 provinces

1081
01:25:36,397 --> 01:25:37,455
The secret book of 5 Tigers school.

1082
01:25:37,632 --> 01:25:37,927
Ready?

1083
01:25:38,266 --> 01:25:39,528
Ready

1084
01:25:44,606 --> 01:25:46,164
The weapons of Chu and his friends here.

1085
01:25:46,374 --> 01:25:47,739
Something's wrong at the prison.

1086
01:25:47,909 --> 01:25:49,467
You better be careful.

1087
01:25:51,646 --> 01:25:52,408
While leaving the gate,

1088
01:25:52,580 --> 01:25:53,774
remember to dispose it off

1089
01:25:53,948 --> 01:25:54,937
sure

1090
01:26:09,597 --> 01:26:10,655
We change their clothes immediately...

1091
01:26:10,832 --> 01:26:11,856
and go to the Hall.

1092
01:26:35,723 --> 01:26:38,351
Xinghu's hand and governor's head

1093
01:26:38,526 --> 01:26:39,925
The secret book of 5 Tigers school.

1094
01:26:40,261 --> 01:26:43,424
Prepare your money for these items

1095
01:26:44,499 --> 01:26:45,659
Tian Zhi Hou.

1096
01:26:51,773 --> 01:26:52,831
Who are you?

1097
01:26:54,475 --> 01:26:55,703
Li Yuhan of Jade villa...

1098
01:26:55,877 --> 01:26:57,902
Yi Tien-hung

1099
01:26:58,246 --> 01:26:59,804
I'm Chu Liu-hsiang.

1100
01:27:01,449 --> 01:27:03,610
We're here just to take on Mr. Bat

1101
01:27:03,785 --> 01:27:06,310
Please leave the hall.

1102
01:27:21,636 --> 01:27:24,036
How could you escape from there?

1103
01:27:24,872 --> 01:27:28,933
As your luck is gone.

1104
01:27:46,527 --> 01:27:47,619
Hold it.

1105
01:27:47,895 --> 01:27:48,554
You're too weak...

1106
01:27:48,730 --> 01:27:51,062
to fight with these 3 heroes

1107
01:27:51,399 --> 01:27:52,923
and the guests in the 2 rooms.

1108
01:27:53,268 --> 01:27:55,031
May I ask who you are?

1109
01:28:00,575 --> 01:28:01,872
Master Fumei.

1110
01:28:11,686 --> 01:28:12,983
Who are you?

1111
01:28:15,290 --> 01:28:17,986
Brother of Wuhua,

1112
01:28:18,326 --> 01:28:21,625
Monk Wugan from Japan

1113
01:28:24,565 --> 01:28:27,966
I tried to buy your head last year.

1114
01:28:53,995 --> 01:28:59,490
Hsiang's reputation isn't a bluff. Bye.

1115
01:29:03,604 --> 01:29:07,062
Let me take care of my family matter.

1116
01:29:09,143 --> 01:29:09,973
Master Fumei, didn't...

1117
01:29:10,144 --> 01:29:11,975
Did you die on the boat?

1118
01:29:12,146 --> 01:29:14,580
No. I just discovered someone...

1119
01:29:14,782 --> 01:29:16,613
hiring a killer to get rid of me.

1120
01:29:16,784 --> 01:29:18,581
So I pretended to be dead first.

1121
01:29:19,487 --> 01:29:22,422
Suiyun, do you know who was after my life?

1122
01:29:23,691 --> 01:29:24,783
Suiyun

1123
01:29:29,630 --> 01:29:31,097
How did you know it's me?

1124
01:29:31,432 --> 01:29:33,400
Of course

1125
01:29:33,568 --> 01:29:36,765
Because I'm your mom and you're my son.

1126
01:29:37,839 --> 01:29:38,931
What?

1127
01:29:40,575 --> 01:29:42,475
20 years ago, I left your father...

1128
01:29:42,643 --> 01:29:43,871
with your elder brother.

1129
01:29:44,045 --> 01:29:46,878
I asked Mr. And Mrs. Shandong to...

1130
01:29:47,048 --> 01:29:48,447
bring him up and I rested secretly
in Huashan.

1131
01:29:48,616 --> 01:29:51,585
I thought I could avoid the trouble.

1132
01:29:51,753 --> 01:29:53,584
But 20 years later, I heard of the...

1133
01:29:53,755 --> 01:29:55,950
Bat Island jeopardizing the boxers' world

1134
01:29:56,124 --> 01:29:57,648
Your brother sent me a letter...

1135
01:29:57,825 --> 01:30:00,419
telling me that Mr. Bat could be you.

1136
01:30:00,628 --> 01:30:03,188
I asked him to gather righteous boxers

1137
01:30:03,531 --> 01:30:06,864
at simin villa, but they're all killed.

1138
01:30:07,034 --> 01:30:09,161
Your brother became mentally retarded

1139
01:30:09,537 --> 01:30:13,132
I was almost killed when showing up again

1140
01:30:13,841 --> 01:30:16,605
suiyun, didn't you do all of this?

1141
01:30:16,778 --> 01:30:20,771
Mom, how can you say such a thing?

1142
01:30:20,982 --> 01:30:21,812
I'm your son. How could...

1143
01:30:22,016 --> 01:30:23,608
I try to kill you and my brother?

1144
01:30:31,759 --> 01:30:32,657
Are you alright, mom?

1145
01:30:32,860 --> 01:30:34,157
I'm alright.

1146
01:30:39,567 --> 01:30:41,194
Hand over this rascal to me.

1147
01:31:18,606 --> 01:31:21,200
Well, what do you have to say?

1148
01:31:25,079 --> 01:31:27,570
You humiliated the Wuchang villa...

1149
01:31:27,748 --> 01:31:29,215
and the Yuan's family.

1150
01:31:29,584 --> 01:31:31,108
Brother, listen to me. I...

1151
01:31:31,285 --> 01:31:33,253
shut up. Go talk to mom.

1152
01:31:34,856 --> 01:31:38,087
Stop. Why?

1153
01:31:38,259 --> 01:31:39,886
Why did you and him have to...

1154
01:31:40,061 --> 01:31:42,029
meddle in my affairs?

1155
01:31:42,530 --> 01:31:45,727
I was separated from you for 20 years.

1156
01:31:45,900 --> 01:31:47,492
You didn't raise me.

1157
01:31:47,668 --> 01:31:48,692
Even I didn't know you

1158
01:31:50,705 --> 01:31:52,673
You must be really eager to know...

1159
01:31:52,840 --> 01:31:55,308
why I became the Mr. Bat.

1160
01:31:55,776 --> 01:31:58,244
Coz my family's reputation is too good.

1161
01:31:58,579 --> 01:32:01,776
No matter how good I'm in martial art,

1162
01:32:01,949 --> 01:32:04,884
I'm the only heir to Wuchang villa;

1163
01:32:05,052 --> 01:32:07,316
the only son of my father.

1164
01:32:07,688 --> 01:32:08,245
Who ever knows...

1165
01:32:08,589 --> 01:32:11,285
I'm the most powerful Yuan suiyun

1166
01:32:11,859 --> 01:32:12,757
only by doing things

1167
01:32:12,927 --> 01:32:15,521
completely different from you guys

1168
01:32:15,696 --> 01:32:17,095
can catch your attention that

1169
01:32:17,298 --> 01:32:20,756
there's a blind man better than you.

1170
01:32:21,903 --> 01:32:22,961
Only by doing so,

1171
01:32:23,137 --> 01:32:25,128
I can avenge...

1172
01:32:25,306 --> 01:32:26,898
the unfairness of my destiny.

1173
01:32:27,074 --> 01:32:29,099
What's unfair to you?

1174
01:32:29,610 --> 01:32:31,942
Why was I an abandoned son?

1175
01:32:32,113 --> 01:32:34,604
Why was I blind?

1176
01:32:39,687 --> 01:32:40,711
Who are you?

1177
01:32:40,888 --> 01:32:42,651
How dare you grab my sword?

1178
01:32:42,823 --> 01:32:44,757
If I don't dare, I'm not Yi Tien-hung

1179
01:32:52,366 --> 01:32:54,561
Children, put out the fire and leave.

1180
01:33:02,643 --> 01:33:03,667
Start the traps.

1181
01:33:12,653 --> 01:33:15,019
Have you heard that...

1182
01:33:15,189 --> 01:33:16,588
in a dark place,

1183
01:33:16,757 --> 01:33:18,816
the blind is the most powerful.

1184
01:33:19,393 --> 01:33:22,123
It's because you can't see how I attack,

1185
01:33:22,296 --> 01:33:25,026
but I can hear where you are.

1186
01:33:26,667 --> 01:33:30,103
You don't see a single thing now.

1187
01:33:30,938 --> 01:33:33,839
But there's a thing you can see.

1188
01:33:34,041 --> 01:33:36,839
That's the road to hell!

1189
01:33:51,025 --> 01:33:52,151
Mr. Yuan...

1190
01:33:56,297 --> 01:33:57,992
Now you may regret

1191
01:33:58,165 --> 01:34:00,656
that you're too officious.

1192
01:34:01,102 --> 01:34:03,434
Okay. No more kidding.

1193
01:34:03,771 --> 01:34:05,033
From now on,

1194
01:34:05,239 --> 01:34:07,139
I'll kill all of you one by one.

1195
01:34:08,442 --> 01:34:10,637
Let me see which one would I start with...!

1196
01:34:11,178 --> 01:34:13,976
Kill the officious Chu Liu-hsiang first.

1197
01:34:17,952 --> 01:34:20,978
Mr. Bat.

1198
01:34:21,155 --> 01:34:24,090
Why don't you kill me first?

1199
01:34:25,226 --> 01:34:26,716
Aren't you scared of me, Yi Tien-hung?

1200
01:34:26,894 --> 01:34:29,362
What? I afraid of you?

1201
01:34:33,768 --> 01:34:36,396
Okay. Lemme spare Hsiang for a while.

1202
01:34:36,771 --> 01:34:38,238
I'll kill Yi Tien-hung first.

1203
01:34:56,090 --> 01:34:58,456
These attacks are really lethal.

1204
01:34:58,793 --> 01:35:01,887
What? Is Yi Tien-hung dead?

1205
01:35:03,798 --> 01:35:05,095
How would I die?

1206
01:35:05,266 --> 01:35:07,257
I was just hurt in the arm.

1207
01:35:07,468 --> 01:35:10,699
I'm going to kill you, Mr. Bat.

1208
01:35:10,871 --> 01:35:12,771
One arm will be enough.

1209
01:35:13,074 --> 01:35:17,909
Really? But you don't know where I am

1210
01:35:18,079 --> 01:35:21,014
No matter how good you fight...

1211
01:35:25,186 --> 01:35:26,813
You are going to die.

1212
01:35:28,422 --> 01:35:31,914
It's hard to attack without seeing him.

1213
01:35:33,194 --> 01:35:36,527
Next time when you deal with me,

1214
01:35:36,864 --> 01:35:39,162
bring more candles.

1215
01:35:39,366 --> 01:35:42,961
But you wouldn't get a second chance,
would you!

1216
01:36:31,852 --> 01:36:34,343
How can they see my hands?

1217
01:36:35,289 --> 01:36:35,983
Do they hear...

1218
01:36:36,157 --> 01:36:37,488
the sound of pearl on my body?

1219
01:37:09,056 --> 01:37:11,524
So you've the most priceless treasure

1220
01:37:11,859 --> 01:37:15,192
the Pearl of south sea.

1221
01:37:15,362 --> 01:37:17,023
It's a pity that you've only one pearl.

1222
01:37:17,198 --> 01:37:19,894
You don't have another one.

1223
01:37:20,968 --> 01:37:22,560
From now on,

1224
01:37:22,903 --> 01:37:25,337
the next battle will take you to hell.

1225
01:37:44,992 --> 01:37:47,290
Mr. Li

1226
01:37:47,628 --> 01:37:49,493
Master Hsiang...

1227
01:37:50,431 --> 01:37:52,558
If you get a chance,

1228
01:37:52,933 --> 01:37:58,303
take my dead body back to the ice cave

1229
01:37:58,472 --> 01:38:03,375
so that I can stay with Wumin forever.

1230
01:38:12,119 --> 01:38:15,179
The most lethal attack of
Black Devil school

1231
01:38:15,356 --> 01:38:17,950
to kill you with your own sword.

1232
01:38:18,259 --> 01:38:20,352
I'll take your weapons...

1233
01:38:20,527 --> 01:38:21,585
and kill you with them.

1234
01:38:27,534 --> 01:38:28,432
Mr. Yuan...

1235
01:38:28,602 --> 01:38:30,467
suiyun, how are you?

1236
01:38:34,508 --> 01:38:37,477
Hsiang is the only one left now.

1237
01:40:12,806 --> 01:40:17,368
Suiyun...

1238
01:40:32,192 --> 01:40:33,784
What's he doing?

1239
01:40:34,128 --> 01:40:36,187
He promised a deceased friend that,

1240
01:40:36,363 --> 01:40:38,092
come what may;

1241
01:40:38,298 --> 01:40:41,290
he will tie Mr. Bat's body up...

1242
01:40:41,468 --> 01:40:42,730
to hand over to the King.
