why aren't you working?

老板，我半夜起身推磨做豆腐
Boss, I woke up almost at midnight to make tofu,

27
00:07:19,205 --> 00:07:21,503
到现在一夜都没停过
and I didn't get a break.

28
00:07:21,607 --> 00:07:24,542
我请你做伙计就是不准你停
That's the point of hiring you;

29
00:07:24,644 --> 00:07:28,239
做…不停的做
Working non-stop.

30
00:07:30,783 --> 00:07:32,410
我不做了，你做吧
I quit. You can do it.

00:07:32,718 --> 00:07:34,117
阿金
Jin.

32
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:42,458
请
Please.

33
00:07:44,096 --> 00:07:45,563
让开，豆腐来了
Move over, the tofu.

34
00:07:48,701 --> 00:07:53,798
阿金…我…
Jin... l...

35
00:07:57,610 --> 00:07:59,305
擦擦汗总可以吧
Guess I could at least wipe off the sweat.

36
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:06,410
黄老板，伙计抹抹汗不算偷懒吧
Boss Huang, I don't think he's idling,

37
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:07,543
对不对？
agree?

38
00:08:10,923 --> 00:08:12,618
黄老板小心点
Careful, Boss Huang.

39
00:08:12,725 --> 00:08:14,090
要是捧不住
If you can't hold it,

40
00:08:14,193 --> 00:08:17,162
这十来架豆腐就血本无归了
then it will be a disaster.

41
00:08:17,263 --> 00:08:20,289
阿金，快来帮个忙
Jin, come help!

42
00:08:21,234 --> 00:08:22,599
来了…
Coming...

43
00:08:24,804 --> 00:08:28,331
老板，您有什么吩咐？
Yes, boss?

44
00:08:36,382 --> 00:08:38,680
黄老板，别怪阿金不做生意
Boss Huang, don't blame Jin that he's not working.

45
00:08:38,784 --> 00:08:40,775
我就是来买豆腐的
I'm here to buy some tofu.

46
00:09:00,106 --> 00:09:03,371
杨大宝，你还想不想干？
Yang Dabao, you want me to fire you?

47
00:09:03,476 --> 00:09:05,137
买点豆腐去了那么久
You took quite a while to buy tofu!

48
00:09:05,244 --> 00:09:07,508
像你这样我别做生意了
I've got a restaurant to run here.

49
00:09:07,613 --> 00:09:10,741
是，老板，我这不回来了吗
Yes, boss. Well, I'm back now.

50
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:12,442
快摆好桌子
Set the tables.

51
00:09:14,787 --> 00:09:16,687
老板，你得让开点
Excuse me, boss.

52
00:09:16,789 --> 00:09:19,849
我总得把豆腐拿到厨房里去
I need to bring these to the kitchen.

53
00:09:25,498 --> 00:09:27,898
快点…手脚俐落点
Hurry up!

54
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:53,058
老板，请坐…两位吃点什么？
This way please. What would you like to eat?

55
00:09:53,159 --> 00:09:54,922
伙计，来两碗牛肉面
Two bowls of beef noodles.

56
00:09:55,027 --> 00:09:55,516
好
Right away.

57
00:09:55,628 --> 00:09:57,789
牛肉面两碗
Two bowls of beef noodles.

58

00:10:22,888 --> 00:10:28,121
蒸牛肉、煮水蛋，半斤白干，快点

60
00:10:30,329 --> 00:10:31,819
客倌，坐
Please have a seat.

61
00:10:35,334 --> 00:10:35,823
两位
Welcome.

62
00:10:35,935 --> 00:10:36,424
切鸡一盘
A dish of chicken.

63
00:10:36,535 --> 00:10:38,025
好
Okay

64
00:10:40,706 --> 00:10:43,402
喂，大爷有事，快点
Hey! I'm in a rush here! Hurry up!

65
00:10:43,509 --> 00:10:47,741
是…听见没有？
Yes... can't you hear?

66
00:10:47,847 --> 00:10:49,872
这两位爷儿们要先上
Bring the dishes to them first.

67
00:10:50,449 --> 00:10:52,076
好，我知道了
Got it.

68
00:11:04,697 --> 00:11:07,461
来了，快点快点
Coming. Hurry!

69
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:16,433
客倌，对不起
Sorry, sir.

70
00:11:16,542 --> 00:11:19,033
大人有大量，我可不是故意的
I was careless.

71
00:11:21,814 --> 00:11:22,781
鼻子
The nose.

72
00:11:26,652 --> 00:11:28,847
起来起来，对不起
Get up. Sorry.

73
00:11:52,278 --> 00:11:55,111
老板，这个鸡腿上有个苍蝇
Boss, there's a fly on this chicken leg,

74
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:55,771
要不要把它给扔掉？
should I throw it away?

75
00:11:55,881 --> 00:11:57,542
啊？扔了？
Throw it away?

76
00:11:57,650 --> 00:12:01,142
把这个苍蝇弄掉照样给他们吃
Get rid of the fly, and give it to them.

77
00:12:09,495 --> 00:12:11,520
喂，这鸡腿怎么这样？
Hey, what's wrong with this?

78
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:14,064
请放心，这个鸡腿上本来有个苍蝇
Don't worry. There's a fly here,

79
00:12:14,166 --> 00:12:16,430
老板吩咐我把它给弄掉
the boss told me to get rid of it.

80
00:12:16,535 --> 00:12:18,901
不要紧的，尽管吃好了
Don't worry, eat up.

81
00:12:19,004 --> 00:12:20,904
老板，这怎么吃啊？
How can I eat it?

82
00:12:21,006 --> 00:12:22,337
我们这儿东西是绝对干净
Our food is very clean here.

83
00:12:22,441 --> 00:12:24,773
不要听他胡说八道，你这小子
Don't listen to him.

84
00:12:24,877 --> 00:12:26,037
两位
Gentlemen.

85
00:12:30,683 --> 00:12:34,016
最要紧的是上好门板，收拾好铺子
Be sure to lock the shop up.

86
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,678
洗干净所有的东西
Clean up everything.

87
00:12:35,788 --> 00:12:37,278
泡好明天要磨的豆子
Soak the beans for tomorrow.

88
00:12:37,389 --> 00:12:39,084
早点起来推磨
Wake up early to grind the beans.

89
00:12:40,092 --> 00:12:42,686
干什么？你要砸铺子？
What now? Are you trying to wreck the shop?

90
00:12:43,195 --> 00:12:45,095
推好了磨马上煮豆汁
When you're done, start to boil the juice.

91
00:12:45,197 --> 00:12:46,164
煮好了豆汁
When you've boiled the juice,

92
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:48,495
一边做豆腐一边做豆腐干
make some tofu and dried tofu.

93
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:51,764
一边炸豆腐，你可别偷懒
And you can deep-fry some, don't try to slack off.

94
00:12:51,871 --> 00:12:53,805
我要是知道你偷懒就得扣工钱
If I find out, I'll deduct it from your pay.

95
00:12:53,906 --> 00:12:56,101
砸烂了东西也得扣工钱
If you break anything, that's coming off your pay too.

96
00:12:56,208 --> 00:12:59,405
开门晚了我还是得扣工钱
And if you open the shop late, I'll deduct your pay.

97
00:12:59,512 --> 00:13:00,604
是
Yes.

98
00:13:29,542 --> 00:13:32,477
奇怪，怎么每天临走都得摔一跤
It's strange! Why do I trip everyday?

99
00:13:56,735 --> 00:13:57,724
杨大宝
Yang Dabao.

100
00:14:02,141 --> 00:14:03,233
杨大宝
Yang Dabao.

101
00:14:10,115 --> 00:14:11,582
你在上边干什么？
What are you doing up there?

102
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:16,378
我来看
Let me see what your

103
00:14:16,488 --> 00:14:20,151
看你们黑虎门练什么叫化子功夫
Black Tiger Clan's martial arts style is all about

104
00:14:30,302 --> 00:14:35,433
你懂什么，这就叫点指神仙钵
What do you know? This is the fairy's bowl.

105
00:14:35,975 --> 00:14:39,035
我说这是叫化子钵
I think it's more like a beggar's bowl.

106
00:14:43,249 --> 00:14:45,649
来，只要你能够抢到这个叫化子钵
Alright. If you can snatch this beggar's bowl,

107
00:14:45,751 --> 00:14:47,218
就有好东西吃
you're in for a yummy treat.

108
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:03,626
戴上
Wear it.

109
00:15:57,856 --> 00:15:59,323
叫化子钵在我这儿了
I've got it!

110
00:15:59,425 --> 00:16:00,790
快拿东西来吃
Yummy food!

111
00:16:04,563 --> 00:16:05,495
好
Very well.

112
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:39,021
你信不信如果我不想让你吃
Do you believe that with this pair of chopsticks

113
00:16:39,131 --> 00:16:40,325
就凭我这双筷子
I can stop you from eating?

114
00:16:40,432 --> 00:16:42,798
说什么你也进不了口
You don't have a chance to eat anything.

115
00:16:46,305 --> 00:16:47,567
我跟我爹学武的时候
When I was learning martial arts from my dad,

116
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:49,334
就是躲不开他这双筷子
that's what he did.

117
00:16:49,441 --> 00:16:51,636
整整吃了大半年的白饭
For over half a year, I ate plain rice.

118
00:16:52,344 --> 00:16:53,811
我们家传黑虎门的武功
The main feature of the martial arts of my family,

119
00:16:53,912 --> 00:16:54,708
最大的特点就是
the Black Tiger Clan is that,

120
00:16:54,813 --> 00:16:56,405
身边不论有什么东西
we can pick up anything handy beside us,

121
00:16:56,515 --> 00:16:58,710
都可以拿来做武器
and use it as a weapon.

122
00:16:58,817 --> 00:17:00,409
在吃饭的时候…
While we're eating...

123
00:17:27,413 --> 00:17:30,143
吃大半年的白饭滋味可不好捱
Ain't very nice to eat plain rice for over six months.

124
00:17:30,249 --> 00:17:31,511
可不是嘛
Definitely not.

125
00:17:31,617 --> 00:17:34,814
不过等我爹制不住我的时候…
But when my dad couldn't stop me...

126
00:18:16,795 --> 00:18:18,262
你明白了？
Do you get it?

127
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:22,530
我先吞下去有空再慢慢的嚼
Swallow first, then chew later.

128
00:18:25,204 --> 00:18:26,535
黑虎门功夫
For the Black Tiger Clan's martial arts,

129
00:18:26,638 --> 00:18:29,266
随手可拿到的东西不论大小
we can pick up anything handy beside us,

130
00:18:29,374 --> 00:18:31,001
都可以做兵器
and use it as a weapon.

131
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:32,441
真不简单
That's really something.

132
00:18:32,878 --> 00:18:34,140
你也别客气了
Don't be modest.

133
00:18:34,246 --> 00:18:37,409
你练的螳螂也是上乘功夫
The Mantis Style you're learning is very difficult too.

134
00:18:37,516 --> 00:18:40,314
没有听你提起过你的师傅是谁
I've never heard about your master.

135
00:18:41,687 --> 00:18:43,678
连我也不知道是谁
I don't know who he is.

136
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:46,553
哪有这种事？
How can that be?

137
00:18:46,658 --> 00:18:50,424
我遇到我师傅是在三年前
I met my master three years ago.

138
00:18:51,296 --> 00:18:52,763
我还在乡下
I was still in my hometown then

139
00:18:59,838 --> 00:19:04,275
小子，一人叫一声爷爷就放过你
Kid, c'mon address me as "grandpa" and I'll let you go.

140
00:19:04,376 --> 00:19:05,604
龟孙子
Bastard!

141
00:19:06,311 --> 00:19:07,801
小子，你叫不叫
Come on, kid!

142
00:19:07,913 --> 00:19:09,073
龟孙子
Bastard!

143
00:19:29,067 --> 00:19:32,230
爷爷饶命…爷爷
Spare us, "grandpa"!

144
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:40,839
拜见师傅…
Master.

145
00:21:12,904 --> 00:21:14,269
再试试这个
Try this.

146
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:35,053
过了两年，师傅不告而别
My master left after two years.

147
00:21:35,927 --> 00:21:38,623
我连他老人家的姓名都不知道
I didn't even know his name.

148
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:46,237
这才是世外高人
That's a true master.

149
00:21:56,715 --> 00:21:58,273
你我都有一身的功夫
Both of us have skills,

150
00:21:58,383 --> 00:21:59,873
在这个街市上混
I don't know how long

151
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:02,783
不知道哪天才有出人头地的日子
we must wait to become something in this field

152
00:22:02,888 --> 00:22:04,788
做一番英雄事业
that we can do something great!

153
00:22:05,624 --> 00:22:08,218
如果有这一天我拼了这条命都肯
I'd risk my life for that day!

154
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:09,316
好
Great!

155
00:22:13,532 --> 00:22:15,227
我们两个人都想做英雄人物
We both want to be heroes,

156
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:15,857
可是就是不知道
we just don't know

157
00:22:15,967 --> 00:22:17,798
要等到哪一天才能够做得到
when that will happen.

158
00:22:17,903 --> 00:22:19,063
真气人
I can't wait.

159
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:22,864
早晚有这么一天的
It will happen one of these days.

160
00:22:24,676 --> 00:22:26,610
好家伙，说打就打
Alright! A fight!

161
00:22:44,296 --> 00:22:45,228
打和
Get even!

162
00:23:19,798 --> 00:23:21,356
我晕了
I'm going to faint.

163
00:23:25,771 --> 00:23:27,136
还说做英雄好汉
And you said you want to be a hero,

164
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:29,207
连坛酒都舍不得
you can't let go of this wine.

165
00:23:29,975 --> 00:23:32,409
不是我舍不得，是老板舍不得
It's not me, it's my boss.

166
00:23:32,511 --> 00:23:34,706
在没有做英雄之前还得吃饭
I still need ajob before I become a hero.

167
00:23:34,813 --> 00:23:35,837
对不对？
Right?

168
00:23:42,421 --> 00:23:43,319
快点睡觉吧
Go to sleep.

169
00:23:43,422 --> 00:23:45,822
半夜里还得起来推磨
You need to get up to work in the middle of the night.

170
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:06,771
"Qingyun Temple"

171
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:12,474
啊，洪举官
Hong Xiguan.

172
00:24:12,584 --> 00:24:14,176
"Master Zhishan, Shaolin Monastery"

173
00:24:17,556 --> 00:24:18,352
洪师兄

00:24:24,463 --> 00:24:27,489
"Fang Xiaoyu"

177
00:24:28,133 --> 00:24:29,293
扶他起来
Help him up.

178
00:24:31,002 --> 00:24:33,630
别动他，扶他坐好
Don't move him, help him to sit up.

179
00:24:50,055 --> 00:24:51,522
至善师父
Master Zhishan.

180
00:24:51,623 --> 00:24:54,353
举官，你内伤沉重
Xiguan, you have serious internal injuries.

181
00:24:54,459 --> 00:24:56,586
这位是喇嘛派的星龙长老
This is Master Xinglong of Lama Clan.

182
00:24:56,695 --> 00:24:59,391
善于治伤，你且别动
He's a healer, don't move.

183
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:01,966
师父，西禅寺已经被白眉道人
Master, the West Meditation Temple has been torn apart

184
00:25:02,067 --> 00:25:05,628
高进忠和武当派的人给破了
by White Brows Priest, Gao Jinzhong and the others.

185
00:25:06,371 --> 00:25:12,105
三德师兄、童千斤、年瑞卿
Brother Sande, Tong Qianjin, Nian Ruiqing,

186
00:25:12,210 --> 00:25:14,940
李锦纶、胡惠干他们都…
Li Jinlun, Hu Weigan... they're all dead.

187
00:25:15,046 --> 00:25:17,207
七情六欲，澎湃翻腾
Being emotional is the cause of internal injuries.

188
00:25:17,315 --> 00:25:20,842
是内伤之本，吸气
Inhale.

189
00:25:23,822 --> 00:25:25,585
我全明白了
I understand.

190
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:28,818
他们迟早会到庆云寺来
They will come to Qingyun Temple eventually.

191
00:25:28,927 --> 00:25:33,421
你伤得很重，一时之间难以痊愈
You're badly injured, it will take some time to heal.

192
00:25:33,532 --> 00:25:37,662
我弟子中有个叫周成的开设武馆
My student Zhou Cheng runs a martial arts school.

193
00:25:37,769 --> 00:25:41,728
你可以去找他，由他替你慢慢治伤
You can look for him, and he can take care of you.

194
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:45,071
白眉、高进忠要是再来
If White Brows and Gao Jinzhong come here,

195
00:25:45,176 --> 00:25:46,438
我正好跟他们拼命
I've to put up a fight with them.

196
00:25:46,545 --> 00:25:50,948
你伤成这样留此无益，还不快走
You can't help in your state. You should leave soon.

197
00:25:51,049 --> 00:25:54,314
韩七如今在红船当小武
Han Qi works as an acrobat with a theatre troupe.

198
00:25:54,419 --> 00:25:55,852
你可跟他联络
You can contact him.

199
00:25:57,355 --> 00:25:59,346
我们西藏喇嘛派不便卷入
Our Tibetan Lama Clan don't want to get involved

200
00:25:59,457 --> 00:26:03,484
中土朝廷和少林之争，告辞了
in the fight between the Court and Shaolin, goodbye.

201
00:26:04,396 --> 00:26:06,364
你等一等，我进去开一张药方给你
Wait. I'll give you a prescription.

202
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:07,726
是
Yes.

203
00:26:10,602 --> 00:26:14,038
世玉你去拿点衣服银两来给举官
Shiyu, pack some clothes and money for Xiguan.

204
00:26:14,139 --> 00:26:15,299
是
Yes.

205
00:26:17,943 --> 00:26:20,036
我和世玉、美玉、孝玉
I'll stay here temporarily

206
00:26:20,145 --> 00:26:21,908
他们暂时留在此地
with Shiyu, Meiyu and Xiaoyu.

207
00:26:22,013 --> 00:26:23,844
一等走散的同门聚集
After we've gathered the rest of the students,

208
00:26:23,949 --> 00:26:25,507
也会和韩七联络找你
we'll contact Han Qi and yourself.

209
00:26:25,617 --> 00:26:26,777
是，师父
Yes, master.

210
00:26:36,428 --> 00:26:37,759
我可以送你一程
I could walk some distance with you.

211
00:26:37,862 --> 00:26:40,092
告诉你去找周成的地方
I'll tell you how to get to Zhou Cheng.

212
00:26:46,204 --> 00:26:47,466
"Zhou Cheng Martial Arts School"

213
00:26:47,973 --> 00:26:49,497
"Lama Clan"

214
00:27:05,557 --> 00:27:09,288
本派的桩法与普通的梅花桩不同
These are different from the usual setup.

215
00:27:09,394 --> 00:27:11,385
是按北斗七星排列
Ours is based on the Big Dipper constellation.

216
00:27:11,496 --> 00:27:15,432
高低有异，共七七四十九根
Forty nine in total, all different in height.

217
00:27:15,567 --> 00:27:16,966
这些你们都知道了
You all know that.

218
00:27:17,068 --> 00:27:18,501
知道了
Yes.

219
00:27:18,603 --> 00:27:20,571
你们按我平时的传授
Practise hard

220
00:27:20,672 --> 00:27:22,071
好好地用心练习
from what I have taught you.

221
00:27:22,173 --> 00:27:23,299
是
Yes.

222
00:28:19,130 --> 00:28:21,792
好，慢慢练
Good! Continue practising!

223
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:24,869
日子长了，在七星桩上面
After a certain time, it won't feel

224
00:28:24,969 --> 00:28:27,403
就会像在地面上一样
any different up there from what it's on the ground

225
00:28:29,941 --> 00:28:31,738
朱财怎么还没来？
Where's Zhu Cai?

226
00:28:36,114 --> 00:28:37,376
师傅
Master.

227
00:28:38,149 --> 00:28:39,639
站住
Wait.

228
00:28:39,751 --> 00:28:42,311
你这个时候才来像是练功夫的人吗
You're late. Do you take your lesson seriously?

229
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:43,785
今天染房里事多
It's very busy at the dye factory today.

230
00:28:43,888 --> 00:28:47,221
我赶着做完了才来，是迟了一点
I rushed here as soon as I could leave.

231
00:28:47,325 --> 00:28:49,452
那你就回染房去吧
Then you should head back.

232
00:28:50,361 --> 00:28:54,525
像你这样练功夫怎么练得成
You can never learn the way you are.

233
00:28:54,632 --> 00:28:57,430
说起来你是我周成的徒弟
I'm ashamed that

234
00:28:57,535 --> 00:28:59,366
给我丢脸
you're my student.

235
00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:09,246
你们看看他想跟我动手
Look! He tries to hit me.

236
00:29:10,915 --> 00:29:13,577
喂，师傅叫你回染房去
Hey! The master sent you back to the dye factory.

237
00:29:13,685 --> 00:29:14,845
你怎么还不走？
What are you doing here still?

238
00:29:14,953 --> 00:29:17,444
我练完七星桩再回去
I'll leave after I've practised.

239
00:29:17,555 --> 00:29:18,817
练七星桩？
Practise on the Big Dipper poles?

240
00:29:18,923 --> 00:29:22,723
好啊，来，我陪你上桩练练
Very well. Come on!

241
00:29:22,827 --> 00:29:25,057
桩上过招容易受伤
It's easy to get injured there.

242
00:29:25,163 --> 00:29:28,257
你是万金之躯我可不敢
I dare not hurt you.

243
00:29:29,834 --> 00:29:31,768
就凭你？
Do you honestly think you can?

244
00:29:34,706 --> 00:29:36,071
上
Go up!

245
00:29:37,175 --> 00:29:40,167
你们看看他多听话
Look how he listens to me!

246
00:30:21,319 --> 00:30:24,186
朱财，你这是干什么？
Zhu Cai, what on earth are you doing?

247
00:30:24,289 --> 00:30:27,816
同门过招，你怎么出手这么重？
How could you be so severe on your classmate?

248
00:30:31,329 --> 00:30:33,024
师傅，他…
Master, he...

249
00:30:33,965 --> 00:30:37,332
你自以为练得不错了，是不是？
You think you've mastered it, don't you?

250
00:30:37,802 --> 00:30:40,327
好，我跟你过几招
Fine, challenge me.

251
00:30:40,438 --> 00:30:41,996
弟子不敢
I dare not to, master.

252
00:30:49,614 --> 00:30:51,309
阿金，我走了
Jin, I'm off.

253
00:30:52,150 --> 00:30:55,210
朱财，站住
Stand still, Zhu Cai.

254
00:31:02,927 --> 00:31:05,691
你们听着，你们替我打
Listen up! Beat him up!

255
00:31:05,797 --> 00:31:08,925
打中一拳，踢中一脚一两银子
I'll pay a tael of silver for every punch and kick!

256
00:31:25,216 --> 00:31:27,150
喂，你怎么不还手？
Hey! Why didn't you fight back?

257
00:31:27,252 --> 00:31:29,618
就算打不过也要拼命啊
You must try your best even if there's no hope to win.

258
00:31:31,322 --> 00:31:34,291
打，打中一拳一两银子
Come on! You'll get paid.

259
00:31:35,159 --> 00:31:37,593
我打中一拳，你欠我一两银子
One punch, you owe me a tael.

260
00:31:40,965 --> 00:31:43,195
我连中五拳，前后六两
Five punches, six taels of silver all together.

261
00:32:01,252 --> 00:32:02,947
你到底有没有钱给？
Can you afford it?

262
00:32:03,054 --> 00:32:07,491
一共是一百三十四两，你给不给？
One hundred and thirty four taels. Pay up.

263
00:32:12,397 --> 00:32:13,887
一百五十
One hundred and fifty.

264
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:17,758
一百七十八
One hundred and seventy eight.

265
00:32:19,537 --> 00:32:21,528
一百九十，一百九十八
One hundred and ninety, one hundred and ninety eight.

266
00:32:21,639 --> 00:32:23,231
一百九十九
One hundred and ninety nine.

267
00:32:26,511 --> 00:32:27,876
正好两百两
Two hundred!

268
00:32:33,851 --> 00:32:35,148
走啊
Run.

269
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:39,353
多谢两位，这几位都是我的师兄弟
Thanks, they're all my classmates at the kung fu school

270
00:32:39,457 --> 00:32:41,482
两位请住手吧
Please stop.

271
00:33:07,352 --> 00:33:08,842
这算什么师傅？
What kind of a master is he?

272
00:33:08,953 --> 00:33:10,818
有钱不一定练得好功夫
A rich person won't necessarily learn well.

273
00:33:10,922 --> 00:33:14,358
我看你的功夫就比同门师兄弟强
I think you're better than the rest of them.

274
00:33:20,164 --> 00:33:23,759
我练了七星桩，请多多指教
I've learnt martial arts on the Big Dipper Poles.

275
00:33:23,868 --> 00:33:26,837
七星桩？在哪里？
Big Dipper Poles? Where?

276
00:33:59,437 --> 00:34:01,632
我们来过两招
Let's have some fun.

277
00:34:07,278 --> 00:34:08,905
我没站好
I lost my balance.

278
00:34:20,358 --> 00:34:22,053
你不行，让我来
My turn!

279
00:35:01,666 --> 00:35:03,861
好，在桩上是你行
Very well! You rule on the poles.

280
00:35:03,968 --> 00:35:06,732
到饭店就看我的了
But I'm better at the restaurant.

281
00:35:08,239 --> 00:35:11,436
到了豆腐店就要看我的功夫
And I'm the best in the tofu shop.

282
00:35:20,751 --> 00:35:22,309
"Qingyun Temple."

283
00:35:29,527 --> 00:35:30,789
韩七？
Han Qi?

284
00:35:32,363 --> 00:35:34,331
我才叫洪举官到红船和你联络
I sent Hong Xiguan to contact you!

285
00:35:34,432 --> 00:35:35,126
你怎么来了？
What are you doing here?

286
00:35:35,233 --> 00:35:37,531
至善师父，外面风声很紧
Master Zhishan, it's very dangerous out there.

287
00:35:37,635 --> 00:35:38,602
我来告诉你
I'm here to inform you.

288
00:35:38,703 --> 00:35:41,001
我知道了，你快回去
I know, just head back.

289
00:35:41,105 --> 00:35:43,596
洪举官受了伤，一定要赶快找到他
Hong Xiguan is injured, you must hurry and find him.

290
00:35:43,708 --> 00:35:45,107
我们暂时留在这里
We're staying here temporarily.

291
00:35:45,209 --> 00:35:47,177
直等逃出来的同门到齐
After the rest of the members are here,

292
00:35:47,278 --> 00:35:50,577
就和你联络，走吧
I'll contact you, go!

293
00:35:50,948 --> 00:35:51,778
从后门走
Leave at the back door.

294
00:35:51,883 --> 00:35:53,009
好
Alright.

295
00:35:55,353 --> 00:35:57,617
我记挂着洪师兄的伤势
I worry about Brother Hong's injuries.

296
00:36:04,729 --> 00:36:07,163
老和尚，这里有一个至善大师吗？
Old monk, is there a Master Zhishan here?

297
00:36:07,265 --> 00:36:08,289
还好你没骂人
Good thing that you weren't rude.

298
00:36:08,399 --> 00:36:10,299
这位就是至善师父了
This is Master Zhishan.

299
00:36:10,401 --> 00:36:12,562
谁说难找，一下就找到了
I didn't expect he'd be so easy to find.

300
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:14,638
这位小施主找我？
You were looking for me?

301
00:36:14,739 --> 00:36:16,502
要你的老命
To kill you.

302
00:36:19,544 --> 00:36:21,444
老的打不过，打小的
Old one too tough; guess I will see to the younger ones.

303
00:36:53,811 --> 00:36:58,214
高进忠，少林叛逆至善为首
Zhishan is the head of those Shaolin members.

304
00:36:58,316 --> 00:37:01,251
门人之中方世玉最强
His best student is Fang Shiyu.

305
00:37:01,352 --> 00:37:04,947
先除方世玉，再合歼至善
Tackle Fang Shiyu first; then we'll both kill Zhishan.

306
00:37:05,056 --> 00:37:07,957
方世玉自小由他母亲苗翠花
Fang Shiyu's mother Miao Cuihua

307
00:37:08,059 --> 00:37:10,584
用药浸洗全身
soaked him in herbal medicine when he was young.

308
00:37:13,631 --> 00:37:16,862
除了下阴，他是刀剑难伤
It's hard to hurt him with swords except his crotch.

309
00:37:16,968 --> 00:37:20,199
你引他起飞脚，由我下手
Try to make him kick, then I'll take care of it.

310
00:37:20,304 --> 00:37:22,864
至善全身也只有双目和下阴
For Zhishan,

311
00:37:22,974 --> 00:37:24,373
是功夫练不到之处
his weakest parts are his eyes 1and crotch.

312
00:37:24,475 --> 00:37:27,444
你攻他双目，引他注意保护眼睛
Attack his eyes, so that he'll try to protect them.

313
00:37:27,545 --> 00:37:28,978
我来取他下阴
Then I'll attack his crotch.

314
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:29,978
好
Sure

315
00:37:30,081 --> 00:37:31,070
上
Go!

316
00:38:30,608 --> 00:38:31,768
至善已死
Zhishan's dead.

317
00:38:31,876 --> 00:38:34,674
少林弟子之中只剩下洪举官一人
Hong Xiguan is the only Shaolin member left.

318
00:38:34,779 --> 00:38:37,407
也被我打成重伤，不足为患
He's not a threat, I injured him well.

319
00:38:37,515 --> 00:38:39,176
高进忠，你带着他们四个人
Gao Jinzhong, you take the four of them,

320
00:38:39,283 --> 00:38:40,307
追寻洪举官
and try to locate Hong Xiguan.

321
00:38:40,418 --> 00:38:42,386
一找到就地格杀
Kill him once you've found him.

322
00:38:42,486 --> 00:38:43,475
是
Yes.

323
00:38:46,357 --> 00:38:47,688
洪师哥
Brother Hong.

324
00:38:49,527 --> 00:38:52,462
王师弟，你一个人在这儿？
Brother Wang, you're here alone?

325
00:38:52,563 --> 00:38:55,361
离开少林寺之后大家都走散了
I got parted from others after we left Shaolin Temple.

326
00:38:55,466 --> 00:38:58,663
我还在找至善师父和师兄弟们
I'm still trying to look for Master Zhishan & the rest.

327
00:38:59,970 --> 00:39:02,666
许多师兄弟都在西禅寺殉难了
Many of them died in West Meditation Temple.

328
00:39:02,773 --> 00:39:06,402
至善师父和方师弟他们还在庆云寺
Zhishan and Brother Fang are still in Qingyun Temple.

329
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:08,205
我就是刚刚从那边来的
I came from there.

330
00:39:08,312 --> 00:39:10,405
现在洪师哥打算去哪儿？
Where do you plan to go now?

331
00:39:12,717 --> 00:39:14,708
你受了伤？
Are you hurt?

332
00:39:17,021 --> 00:39:21,924
是，师父命我同红船上的韩七联络
Yes, the master sent me to contact Han Qi.

333
00:39:22,026 --> 00:39:24,460
不过我离开庆云寺
But when I left Qingyun Temple,

334
00:39:24,562 --> 00:39:26,689
和星龙长老分手之后
and bid goodbye to Master Xinglong

335
00:39:26,797 --> 00:39:29,129
并给高进忠一帮人给追上了
Gao Jinzhong and his gang caught up with me.

336
00:39:29,233 --> 00:39:30,700
还不知道会不会追到这儿来
I'm not sure whether they'll find me here.

337
00:39:30,801 --> 00:39:31,961
那你还是快走吧
Then you had better leave.

338
00:39:32,069 --> 00:39:34,264
要是高进忠他们追到这里
If they get here,

339
00:39:34,372 --> 00:39:36,533
我会相机行事
I'll deal with them.

340
00:39:37,274 --> 00:39:39,242
也好，我们两个在一块儿
At least we're here together,

341
00:39:39,343 --> 00:39:40,776
反而会都脱不了身的
we'll think of something.

342
00:39:40,878 --> 00:39:41,810
我先走
I'm heading off.

343
00:39:41,912 --> 00:39:43,641
你直接去找韩七联络就行了
Try to find Han Qi.

344
00:39:43,748 --> 00:39:47,684
是，师哥，你身上有伤要小心
Yes. Please be careful with your wounds.

345
00:39:47,785 --> 00:39:52,347
我知道，你也要小心，我走了
I know. You be careful too. I'm off.

346
00:39:57,294 --> 00:39:58,659
洪举官
Hong Xiguan.

347
00:44:21,025 --> 00:44:22,822
你们这两个家伙
You two!

348
00:45:33,564 --> 00:45:34,053
来呀
Come on!

349
00:45:34,164 --> 00:45:35,256
再来一次
Another round!

350
00:45:37,601 --> 00:45:39,899
一指定中原
Power of a finger.

351
00:45:44,675 --> 00:45:46,040
下来这儿
Get down here.

352
00:46:37,094 --> 00:46:39,062
你就是洪举官？
You're Hong Xiguan?

353
00:46:39,163 --> 00:46:40,187
是
Yes.

354
00:46:40,564 --> 00:46:43,863
令师星龙长老命我来见周师傅
Your master Xinglong sent me here to meet Master Zhou.

355
00:46:43,967 --> 00:46:45,832
请周师傅替我疗伤
I hope that you could treat me.

356
00:46:46,503 --> 00:46:48,562
本来武林一脉
We're both in the martial arts world,

357
00:46:48,672 --> 00:46:52,836
你受了重伤又曾见过我师父
you're badly injured and have met my master.

358
00:46:53,410 --> 00:46:56,345
可惜我这间武馆地方浅窄
Yet my school is just a small place;

359
00:46:56,446 --> 00:46:58,311
实在容纳不了你老哥这样的
It has no room for such

360
00:46:58,415 --> 00:47:00,645
大英雄、大豪杰
a big hero like yourself.

361
00:47:00,751 --> 00:47:03,185
周师傅，不用说了
Master Zhou, say no more.

362
00:47:03,287 --> 00:47:06,620
我非常明白你的意思，就此告辞
I understand. Goodbye.

363
00:47:10,093 --> 00:47:10,923
洪英雄
Hero Hong.

364
00:47:11,028 --> 00:47:12,359
干什么？
What are you doing?

365
00:47:32,149 --> 00:47:33,878
对不起，客倌
Sorry, sir.

366
00:47:39,089 --> 00:47:41,421
快起来…起来
Get up!

367
00:47:44,094 --> 00:47:46,426
杨大宝，你搞什么鬼？
Yang Dabao, what's wrong with you?

368
00:47:46,530 --> 00:47:47,428
我搞什么鬼？
What's wrong with me?

369
00:47:47,531 --> 00:47:48,429
你看看这些凳子
Look at these stools!

370
00:47:48,532 --> 00:47:51,968
凳子？登子是好的，你看
They're all in good condition, look!

371
00:47:52,369 --> 00:47:53,393
好的？
Good condition?

372
00:47:53,503 --> 00:47:55,232
我坐着就没事
I don't have any problem with it.

373
00:48:04,648 --> 00:48:07,082
老板你看，凳子是好的
Look! All in one piece.

374
00:48:07,184 --> 00:48:08,617
他们不会坐
They just don't know how to sit properly.

375
00:48:10,287 --> 00:48:12,152
客倌，里面请，请
Welcome!

376
00:48:30,407 --> 00:48:32,102
请坐，坐
Please have a seat.

377
00:48:32,209 --> 00:48:36,976
该怎么坐？用四平大马还是子午马
So, how should I sit?

378
00:48:38,982 --> 00:48:43,214
客倌您说笑了，怎么坐都行
Sir, you're kidding. You can sit whatever way you want.

379
00:48:49,426 --> 00:48:53,624
快点，对不起，快点拿张凳子来
Hurry! Sorry. Take a stool

380
00:48:54,364 --> 00:48:55,763
送到那边去
and put it over there.

381
00:48:56,366 --> 00:48:57,355
来了
Coming.

382
00:49:11,181 --> 00:49:12,705
客倌你…
You...

383
00:49:12,816 --> 00:49:13,805
走开
Beat it.

384
00:49:20,691 --> 00:49:22,352
你是黑虎门的？
Black Tiger Clan?

385
00:49:23,660 --> 00:49:25,184
我要找一个人叫韩七
I'm looking for a person named Han Qi,

386
00:49:25,295 --> 00:49:26,887
是在红船上做小武的
he works as an acrobat in the theatre troupe.

387
00:49:26,997 --> 00:49:28,658
你认识不认识
Have you heard of him?

388
00:49:28,765 --> 00:49:31,131
就是韩七，我看过他演戏
Han Qi! I've watched him perform.

389
00:49:31,234 --> 00:49:32,724
红船这两天会来
His red boat will arrive in a few days.

390
00:49:32,836 --> 00:49:35,703
客倌你好像受了伤
You seem to be injured.

391
00:49:37,541 --> 00:49:38,906
算我多嘴
Sorry, it's none of my business.

392
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:52,618
偷懒扣工钱，打烂了东西扣工钱
I'll deduct from your pay if you slack off,

393
00:49:52,723 --> 00:49:56,090
铺子开迟了也得要扣工钱
break anything or open late.

394
00:50:08,538 --> 00:50:14,204
见鬼，得请和尚道士来念念经才行
Damn! I must find a monk for a ceremony.

395
00:50:31,828 --> 00:50:35,457
老兄，你撞翻了我的东西了
Hey, pal! You knocked off my stuff.

396
00:50:35,565 --> 00:50:38,796
怎么搞的，这么大人走路还翻跟头
What's the matter? Can't you walk properly?

397
00:50:38,902 --> 00:50:41,166
真是，我看你八成喝醉酒了
I think you're drunk.

398
00:50:41,271 --> 00:50:43,034
真麻烦
Such trouble!

399
00:50:53,316 --> 00:50:55,079
你是什么人？
Who are you?

400
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,434
陈阿金…
Chen Ajin.

401
00:51:12,536 --> 00:51:13,798
杨大宝，快来
Yang Dabao, come on in.

402
00:51:14,471 --> 00:51:16,962
你让我给你推磨？我可不干
You want me to do yourjob? Never.

403
00:51:17,074 --> 00:51:19,702
跟我的功夫不是一路
It's different from my martial arts style.

404
00:51:21,745 --> 00:51:22,769
你看看
Look.

405
00:51:26,316 --> 00:51:27,943
他是什么人？怎么会在这儿？
Who is he? What's he doing here?

406
00:51:28,051 --> 00:51:29,143
你认识他？
You know him?

407
00:51:29,786 --> 00:51:32,721
不认识，白天在店里见过
No. I saw him in the restaurant earlier.

408
00:51:33,156 --> 00:51:34,316
他是什么人？
Who is he?

409
00:51:34,424 --> 00:51:35,550
我也不知道
Not too sure myself.

410
00:51:35,659 --> 00:51:38,890
在他身上找到了一张纸，你看看
I found this piece of paper on him. Read it.

411
00:51:46,603 --> 00:51:47,729
你也不把灯点起来
Light up!

412
00:51:47,838 --> 00:51:50,500
这么黑你让我怎么看
I can't read anything in the dark.

413
00:52:02,452 --> 00:52:03,976
上面说些什么？
What does it say?

414
00:52:09,626 --> 00:52:11,116
你也不识字
You are an illiterate too?

415
00:52:14,898 --> 00:52:17,366
我看这个人有点来头
I think he must be an important person.

416
00:52:18,802 --> 00:52:20,064
老板回来了
The boss is back.

417
00:52:31,448 --> 00:52:33,177
这是本门师祖星龙长老
This prescription was written by my master's

418
00:52:33,283 --> 00:52:35,410
开的一张疗伤药方
master, Xinglong.

419
00:52:36,586 --> 00:52:38,213
这人伤得很重
He's badly injured.

420
00:52:38,321 --> 00:52:39,447
伤者在里边
The injured person is inside.

421
00:52:44,594 --> 00:52:45,583
他是洪举官
He's Hong Xiguan.

422
00:52:45,695 --> 00:52:47,060
什么？
What?

423
00:52:50,133 --> 00:52:51,760
他是洪举官
He's Hong Xiguan

424
00:52:51,868 --> 00:52:54,735
就是朝廷下令捉拿的大英雄洪举官
The one who's wanted by the Court?

425
00:53:04,447 --> 00:53:05,971
想不到我们能有机会
I never expected that we'd have a chance

426
00:53:06,082 --> 00:53:08,744
和名满天下的大豪杰在一块儿
to meet such a hero.

427
00:53:09,653 --> 00:53:12,781
他的情形很坏
Looks like he's in a pretty bad state.

428
00:53:12,889 --> 00:53:13,981
我去抓药
I'll get the medicine.

429
00:53:14,090 --> 00:53:17,082
师祖开的药方子一定对症
The old master's prescription would work.

430
00:53:19,996 --> 00:53:22,055
绝不能让人知道
Don't let anyone find out though.

431
00:53:23,266 --> 00:53:26,030
能为洪举官砍头也不枉此一生
I wouldn't mind sacrificing for Hong Xiguan.

432
00:53:26,136 --> 00:53:28,696
这样砍了头也好过一世磨豆腐
I'd rather be beheaded than to make tofu my whole life.

433
00:53:28,805 --> 00:53:30,568
"Yan Shou Herbal shop"

434
00:53:33,877 --> 00:53:35,367
多少钱？
How much is it?

435
00:53:35,478 --> 00:53:39,414
每副是三两四钱五分银子
Three taels forty five cents each.

436
00:53:40,350 --> 00:53:42,250
两副就是…
Times two, that comes to...

437
00:53:42,352 --> 00:53:45,719
什么？一副药要那么贵
What? It's so expensive.

438
00:53:45,822 --> 00:53:48,313
这副药可不是普通药
This isn't an ordinary prescription.

439
00:53:48,425 --> 00:53:50,655
单是熊胆末、犀角粉
It costs two taels eighty cents for

440
00:53:50,760 --> 00:53:54,423
这两样已经是二两八钱了
just the bear's bladder and rhino's horn powder.

441
00:53:58,301 --> 00:53:59,233
你干什么？
What are you doing?

442
00:53:59,336 --> 00:54:02,305
药先存着，我没带够钱回去拿
Keep it for me, I don't have enough cash, I'll be back.

443
00:54:07,077 --> 00:54:10,877
我只有一两多银子还不够，你们…
I only have one tael, what about you?

444
00:54:14,818 --> 00:54:18,549
你不是有银子藏着要来娶老婆的
Don't you have some money for your future wedding?

445
00:54:18,655 --> 00:54:20,919
只不过二两，我存了两年了
Only two taels, I saved up for two years.

446
00:54:21,024 --> 00:54:23,322
拿出来…救人要紧
Take it out... for saving a life.

447
00:54:23,426 --> 00:54:24,620
拿出来？
What?

448
00:54:29,065 --> 00:54:30,999
拿出来，救人要紧
Saving a life is more important.

449
00:54:44,681 --> 00:54:47,946
拿来吧，快去
Come on.

450
00:54:48,385 --> 00:54:49,909
还不够啊
Still not enough.

451
00:54:51,321 --> 00:54:53,414
你还有银子存在衣服里
I think you have some money.

452
00:54:53,523 --> 00:54:55,923
快点，快拿出来
Hurry up! Take it out!

453
00:54:56,026 --> 00:54:58,221
快一点，快拿出来
Come on!

454
00:55:09,272 --> 00:55:12,070
你昨天晚上吃了一副药睡得好沉
You slept well after you took the medicine last night.

455
00:55:12,175 --> 00:55:14,109
今天精神好点了吧
Are you feeling better?

456
00:55:16,179 --> 00:55:21,310
三位，我与你们素不相识，你们…
I'm a complete stranger to you, yet you three...

457
00:55:21,418 --> 00:55:23,682
洪大侠别放在心上
You're very welcome, Master Hong.

458
00:55:23,787 --> 00:55:25,186
我们虽然是小人物
Although we are nobody,

459
00:55:25,288 --> 00:55:27,085
可是也知道你是英雄豪杰
but we know that you're a hero.

460
00:55:27,190 --> 00:55:29,750
应该尽力的来帮你
That's why we'd like to help.

461
00:55:30,126 --> 00:55:34,495
像你们那样才是真正的英雄豪杰
You're indeed the real heroes.

462
00:55:55,285 --> 00:55:56,274
快
Come on.

463
00:56:20,677 --> 00:56:23,475
这个药很灵，可是还要多喝几服
This is good medicine, I guess you'd need to continue.

464
00:56:23,580 --> 00:56:27,607
对，至少再喝十副八副
Yes, at least ten times.

465
00:56:30,453 --> 00:56:31,715
买药的钱呢？
What about the money for the medicine?

466
00:56:37,160 --> 00:56:39,253
怎么我问你们不出声啊？
Why don't you answer?

467
00:56:39,362 --> 00:56:41,853
我连老婆本都挖出来了
I even used up the savings for my wedding.

468
00:56:41,965 --> 00:56:45,526
平时你办法最多，该你想办法
You're the one with all the ideas, think of a plan!

469
00:56:48,171 --> 00:56:50,105
好，我们来想想办法
Alright, let us think!

470
00:56:53,943 --> 00:56:55,035
偷
Steal!

471
00:56:56,946 --> 00:56:58,811
媚姑，今天这么早
You're early today, Mei.

472
00:56:59,649 --> 00:57:02,516
阿金，来两块这样的豆腐
Jin, two pieces of tofu.

473
00:57:03,553 --> 00:57:06,044
今天的豆腐包你新鲜
They're really fresh today.

474
00:57:09,225 --> 00:57:11,420
这豆腐真不错，挺新鲜
Yes, looks like it.

475
00:57:11,528 --> 00:57:13,621
阿金，给我包两块豆腐
Give me two pieces, Jin.

476
00:57:19,836 --> 00:57:20,803
谢谢
Thanks.

477
00:57:21,504 --> 00:57:22,596
回家吧
Let's go.

478
00:57:52,602 --> 00:57:56,094
朱财，今天你怎么了？
Zhu Cai, what's the matter with you?

479
00:57:56,206 --> 00:57:58,174
没什么，大叔
Nothing.

480
00:57:58,274 --> 00:58:00,970
穷人急着要钱有什么办法
What can the poor do to get cash quick?

481
00:58:01,077 --> 00:58:06,606
有，有一招，是穷人派的绝招
Yes, there's one thing.

482
00:58:09,385 --> 00:58:10,545
这一招…
It's called...

483
00:58:10,653 --> 00:58:13,315
这一招叫做举世均图
Pawn things.

484
00:58:23,399 --> 00:58:25,458
伙计，算账
The bill please.

485
00:58:30,573 --> 00:58:32,200
一共是一钱二分
Twelve cents.

486
00:58:43,419 --> 00:58:44,545
一钱二分
Twelve cents.

487
00:58:47,490 --> 00:58:49,481
客倌，我叫的菜不错吧？
Did you enjoy the meal?

488
00:58:49,592 --> 00:58:52,322
还算过得去，我们走吧
It's alright, let's go.

489
00:58:58,968 --> 00:59:00,196
可能吃得太饱了
Think I'm too full.

490
00:59:00,303 --> 00:59:02,999
是，两位慢走
Good day.

491
00:59:06,376 --> 00:59:07,502
拿去，谢谢
Take it. Thanks.

492
00:59:08,778 --> 00:59:12,214
来买豆腐？今天的豆腐很新鲜
Tofu? It's fresh today!

493
00:59:23,393 --> 00:59:25,623
最大块的，拿去
The biggest piece, here you go.

494
00:59:26,629 --> 00:59:29,860
王嫂，好久不见你，买豆腐？
Mrs. Wang, it's been a while. Want some tofu?

495
00:59:29,966 --> 00:59:30,796
今天豆腐好新鲜
Very fresh today.

496
00:59:30,900 --> 00:59:33,835
包你新鲜，常来光顾
Please come back again.

497
00:59:39,842 --> 00:59:42,367
阿金，你做什么？
Jin, what are you doing?

498
00:59:42,478 --> 00:59:43,206
没什么，好痒
Nothing, it tickles.

499
00:59:43,313 --> 00:59:44,473
我买豆腐…
Tofu...

500
00:59:44,581 --> 00:59:45,809
有人买豆腐
A customer!

501
00:59:46,716 --> 00:59:49,207
新鲜的豆腐，刚刚磨出来的
Fresh tofu!

502
00:59:49,319 --> 00:59:51,150
你买回去包你满意
The best quality!

503
00:59:51,754 --> 00:59:54,348
拿回去，下次记着再来买，谢谢
Here you go! Come back again! Thanks!

504
00:59:55,992 --> 00:59:58,756
看不出你平时是木头木脑的
Who would have thought?

505
00:59:58,861 --> 01:00:02,262
偷起钱来是又凶又狠
A dumb wit like you would steal from me!

506
01:00:07,003 --> 01:00:08,971
你数数看一共偷了我多少钱
Count it! You've stolen so much from me!

507
01:00:09,072 --> 01:00:12,667
你想叫我血本无归啊
I'm running a business here.

508
01:00:12,775 --> 01:00:16,006
我平时对你不错，供你吃供你住
I've been treating you well.

509
01:00:16,112 --> 01:00:18,137
你这个畜牲
You bastard!

510
01:00:20,249 --> 01:00:23,514
你偷我一文钱我就扣你十文工钱
You must pay ten times of what you've stolen from me.

511
01:00:23,620 --> 01:00:25,315
臭小子你服不服？
Do you understand?

512
01:00:28,291 --> 01:00:29,258
"Pawn"

513
01:00:40,236 --> 01:00:42,227
陈阿金，你那里有多少钱？
Chen Ajin, how much do you have?

514
01:00:42,338 --> 01:00:43,896
我这里有…
I've got...

515
01:00:44,807 --> 01:00:46,570
你是来找陈阿金的？
You're looking for Jin?

516
01:00:46,876 --> 01:00:48,343
你知道不知道阿金偷了我的钱
Do you know that he stole from me?

517
01:00:48,444 --> 01:00:50,537
被我当场抓住了
And I caught him!

518
01:00:51,581 --> 01:00:54,414
我看你鬼头鬼脑的也不是好东西
You don't look like a decent person too.

519
01:00:54,517 --> 01:00:55,415
你来干什么？
What are you here for?

520
01:00:55,518 --> 01:00:57,748
我…
I...

521
01:00:57,854 --> 01:00:59,822
你来干什么的？
What are you doing here?

522
01:01:01,324 --> 01:01:02,848
我来买豆腐的
I'm here to buy tofu.

523
01:01:02,959 --> 01:01:05,655
买豆腐？买多少？
Buy tofu? How much?

524
01:01:05,762 --> 01:01:07,195
全买了
All of it.

525
01:01:10,333 --> 01:01:14,929
大主顾来了，慢慢再跟你算账
We've a big spender today! I'll deal with you later.

526
01:01:16,739 --> 01:01:17,797
来
Come on.

527
01:01:18,841 --> 01:01:21,105
你买这么多的豆腐不好拿
It won't be easy for you to carry with all that tofu,

528
01:01:21,210 --> 01:01:23,940
我叫伙计替你送去
I'll get my staff to help.

529
01:01:26,082 --> 01:01:29,108
好好替他送去，快去快回
Make the delivery and come back soon.

530
01:01:29,218 --> 01:01:32,187
你要是偷懒我就扣你的工钱
I'll deduct from your pay if you try to slack off.

531
01:01:37,493 --> 01:01:38,721
就是你
It's you!

532
01:01:39,062 --> 01:01:41,292
这些花瓶很名贵的
Do you know how expensive the vase is?

533
01:01:47,370 --> 01:01:50,168
你也是的，买这么多豆腐怎么办
What did you buy all that tofu for?

534
01:01:50,273 --> 01:01:54,175
是你叫我买的，你没弄到钱
You told me so. You didn't get any money.

535
01:01:54,277 --> 01:01:55,505
我把什么都送到当铺去
I pawned everything,

536
01:01:55,611 --> 01:01:57,943
换了二十板豆腐回来
and now I've all this tofu.

537
01:02:00,983 --> 01:02:02,712
你们两个在搞什么鬼？
What on earth are you two doing?

538
01:02:09,459 --> 01:02:11,586
你去买药去，把豆腐交给我
Go get the medicine, hand me the tofu.

539
01:02:21,838 --> 01:02:24,898
杨大宝，你上哪儿去了？
Yang Dabao, where are you off to?

540
01:02:25,208 --> 01:02:27,438
哎，你干什么？
What are you doing?

541
01:02:27,543 --> 01:02:29,238
老板，有大生意上门了
Boss, we've got big business.

542
01:02:29,345 --> 01:02:31,142
有贵客要吃各种豆腐
We have guests who like tofu.

543
01:02:31,247 --> 01:02:32,908
贵客？在哪儿？
Guests? Where?

544
01:02:37,487 --> 01:02:39,921
贵客来了，你先把豆腐端到厨房去
If they are, bring these to the kitchen first.

545
01:02:40,022 --> 01:02:41,489
我去招呼
I'll take care of them.

546
01:02:43,826 --> 01:02:45,623
坐…
Please sit down.

547
01:02:49,699 --> 01:02:50,188
有什么吃的？
What's on the menu?

548
01:02:50,299 --> 01:02:51,231
有，豆腐
Oh, tofu.

549
01:02:51,334 --> 01:02:52,892
先来两斤牛肉
How about some beef first?

550
01:02:55,138 --> 01:02:56,867
牛肉都是上个月没有卖完的
The beef, we kept it from last month.

551
01:02:56,973 --> 01:03:00,875
又酸又臭，豆腐最新鲜
It's gone bad! Tofu is fresh.

552
01:03:00,977 --> 01:03:02,672
光吃豆腐怎么行啊
But we can't just eat tofu.

553
01:03:02,779 --> 01:03:05,213
小店专卖豆腐，花样可多了
Tofu is our specialty.

554
01:03:05,314 --> 01:03:07,214
有煎豆腐、炸豆腐、清蒸豆腐

香豆腐、麻油拌豆腐、韭菜炒豆腐
in a soup... you name it, we have it.

558
01:03:15,992 --> 01:03:19,428
将这豆腐每一样炒一大碟
All of the above!

559
01:03:20,596 --> 01:03:22,962
各位就来…
Coming right up...

560
01:03:26,803 --> 01:03:27,963
现在的时势
At this time...

561
01:03:28,070 --> 01:03:30,561
哪有平常百姓带着家伙满街跑
No one would carry weapons so openly,

562
01:03:30,673 --> 01:03:32,538
一定是官府当差的
must be some kind of officers.

563
01:03:36,245 --> 01:03:37,269
谢谢
Thanks.

564
01:03:46,289 --> 01:03:46,778
老板
Boss.

565
01:03:46,889 --> 01:03:48,550
曾大少
Master Zeng.

566
01:03:48,658 --> 01:03:50,922
刚才那人来买什么药？
What did he buy just now?

567
01:03:51,027 --> 01:03:54,463
上好的伤药，买了很多次了
The best, he's been here a few times.

568
01:03:54,564 --> 01:03:55,792
照我看起来
I think someone is badly injured.

569
01:03:55,898 --> 01:03:59,595
好像是有人受了很重的内伤
Internal injuries.

570
01:04:04,006 --> 01:04:06,031
你可记得方子
Can you remember the prescription?

571
01:04:11,647 --> 01:04:14,810
周师傅，这位高大人是我的朋友
Master Zhou, this is my friend Official Gao.

572
01:04:14,917 --> 01:04:17,408
他奉令缉拿叛贼洪举官
He's on the Court's order to catch Hong Xiguan.

573
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:19,954
还要请周师傅多多帮忙
Please assist him anyway you can.

574
01:04:20,056 --> 01:04:21,580
一定一定
Certainly.

575
01:04:22,325 --> 01:04:25,123
我们要追寻的叛贼洪举官
We're trying to look for Hong Xiguan.

576
01:04:25,228 --> 01:04:28,720
据白眉师父说他受的是内伤
According to my master White Brows, Hong's injuries

577
01:04:28,831 --> 01:04:31,231
只有喇嘛派才会治
can only be healed by the Lama Clan.

578
01:04:32,168 --> 01:04:36,537
洪举官不会来找周师傅治伤吧
I wonder if Hong Xiguan came to you for help.

579
01:04:38,174 --> 01:04:41,837
不瞒高提督，洪举官是来找过我
To be frank, he did.

580
01:04:43,880 --> 01:04:45,370
我是守法良民
I'm a law-abiding citizen.

581
01:04:45,481 --> 01:04:47,711
这种叛贼找上门来
A traitor like him came for help,

582
01:04:47,817 --> 01:04:50,547
我当然把他赶走了
I kicked him out right away.

583
01:04:50,653 --> 01:04:53,520
周师傅，要是当时你将他拿下
If Master Zhou captured him on the spot,

584
01:04:53,623 --> 01:04:56,649
倒是替朝廷立了一件大功
you would have helped the court a big deal.

585
01:04:56,759 --> 01:04:59,353
师哥，我看周师傅当时不敢动手
I think master Zhou didn't dare to kill him.

586
01:04:59,462 --> 01:05:01,726
洪举官名头大啊
Hong Xiguan has a reputation.

587
01:05:08,604 --> 01:05:11,971
师傅，有一副方子可是治内伤的
There's one prescription to treat internal injuries.

588
01:05:12,074 --> 01:05:15,441
药方有熊胆末、犀角粉、槲若
Bear's bladder powder, rhino's horn powder...

589
01:05:15,544 --> 01:05:18,104
是，这是本派的秘方
Yes, that's our special prescription.

590
01:05:18,214 --> 01:05:19,340
朱财在买这副药
Zhu Cai bought this prescription many times.

591
01:05:19,448 --> 01:05:23,248
已经买了很多副了，会不会…
Could it be...

592
01:05:24,654 --> 01:05:26,849
对，洪举官来的时候
Right. He's cleaning the room

593
01:05:26,956 --> 01:05:28,583
他正在打扫房间
when Hong Xiguan came here.

594
01:05:28,691 --> 01:05:30,283
谁是朱财？
Who's Zhu Cai?

595
01:05:30,660 --> 01:05:32,651
提督请放心，走不了他
Don't worry, I can take care of him.

596
01:05:32,762 --> 01:05:34,730
他每天会到武馆来
He drops by everyday.

597
01:05:34,830 --> 01:05:39,631
有了叛贼的下落，来，干杯
Cheers! We've found the traitor!

598
01:05:59,855 --> 01:06:02,483
气贯上下，力透全身
Let the "Qi" energy travel through your body.

599
01:06:08,698 --> 01:06:10,996
你们三个人各有所长
You three excel in different areas.

600
01:06:11,100 --> 01:06:13,364
不过没有人指点你们运气的法门
But no one has taught you about the Qi.

601
01:06:13,469 --> 01:06:16,267
出招之际难免有力不从心之感
That's why you might find it difficult

602
01:06:16,372 --> 01:06:19,034
难达上乘的武功境界
for some complicated martial arts styles.

603
01:06:19,141 --> 01:06:21,302
你们武功已有根底
With your foundation,

604
01:06:21,410 --> 01:06:23,401
可以一点即明
it's easy for you to learn.

605
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:27,449
我教你们少林正宗的运气之法门
Let me teach you Shaolin's own use of "Qi".

606
01:06:27,550 --> 01:06:29,780
气先纳于丹田
Gather "Qi" at diaphragm.

607
01:07:00,449 --> 01:07:02,849
我们家招待贵客，厨子不够用
We're treating a VIP guest & we don't have enough chefs

608
01:07:02,952 --> 01:07:06,217
要用你们酒馆里的厨子是看得起你
It's a compliment that we're using your chef.

609
01:07:06,322 --> 01:07:09,951
这个没有厨子我们怎么做生意
How can I run a restaurant without a chef?

610
01:07:10,059 --> 01:07:11,993
你知道我家的贵客什么身份
Do you have any idea who my guest is?

611
01:07:12,094 --> 01:07:14,119
谁理你做不做生意
Who cares whether or not you can do business!

612
01:07:14,663 --> 01:07:16,187
进去把厨子拉出来
Get the chef!

613
01:07:20,369 --> 01:07:25,306
慢着…老兄…有话慢慢说
Wait...

614
01:07:25,408 --> 01:07:26,773
像我们这种小馆子
We're just a small restaurant,

615
01:07:26,876 --> 01:07:29,071
厨子的手艺也好不到哪儿去
our chef isn't that good.

616
01:07:29,178 --> 01:07:32,477
对，煮出来的菜只配喂猪
Yes, the dishes are only good for pigs.

617
01:07:34,283 --> 01:07:37,878
是，这位客倌说的对
Well said.

618
01:07:41,590 --> 01:07:42,579
你要招待贵宾
For your VIP guest,

619
01:07:42,691 --> 01:07:45,785
如果是猪那我们的厨子就有用了
our chef is only useful if you're serving a pig.

620
01:07:46,162 --> 01:07:47,424
你胡言乱语什么？
What are you on about?

621
01:08:00,910 --> 01:08:05,506
别打…别打了
Stop!

622
01:08:05,614 --> 01:08:07,138
老板，不打不行
Boss, we must.

623
01:08:07,249 --> 01:08:07,874
厨子给他们拉起来
They've got the chef;

624
01:08:07,983 --> 01:08:09,610
咱们就没有生意做了
without him, we've no business.

625
01:08:10,719 --> 01:08:12,550
打…
Beat him!

626
01:08:17,526 --> 01:08:19,050
打
Beat him!

627
01:08:47,156 --> 01:08:48,487
来…
Come on!

628
01:09:42,111 --> 01:09:43,874
快走…
Run!

629
01:09:49,018 --> 01:09:50,280
我自己会走
I can walk myself out.

630
01:09:50,386 --> 01:09:53,822
一、二、三
One, two, three.

631
01:09:58,494 --> 01:10:03,295
打…店里的东西全给你们打烂了
You broke everything!

632
01:10:03,399 --> 01:10:05,264
我要扣你们工钱
I'll deduct from your pay

633
01:10:08,537 --> 01:10:09,970
干什么？
What are you doing?

634
01:10:11,807 --> 01:10:14,708
一、二、三
One, two, three.

635
01:10:17,346 --> 01:10:18,370
我叫韩七
I'm Han Qi.

636
01:10:18,480 --> 01:10:19,913
我看过你做戏
I've seen you act.

637
01:10:20,015 --> 01:10:21,505
洪举官大哥在找你
Brother Hong Xiguan is looking for you.

638
01:10:21,617 --> 01:10:22,948
我也在找他
I'm looking for him too.

639
01:10:23,452 --> 01:10:25,044
白天人杂，晚上你来找我
Come pick me up tonight,

640
01:10:25,154 --> 01:10:25,848
咱们一块儿去见他
we'll go meet him.

641
01:10:25,955 --> 01:10:26,887
好
Sure.

642
01:10:29,358 --> 01:10:30,222
师傅
Master.

643
01:10:38,901 --> 01:10:41,461
朱财，你到药铺去买伤药
Zhu Cai, the medicine you bought,

644
01:10:41,570 --> 01:10:43,197
给什么人治伤的？
who's that for?

645
01:10:43,305 --> 01:10:45,899
说，给谁治伤？
Speak up! Who's that for?

646
01:10:46,008 --> 01:10:49,068
给我自己的，我这里疼
For myself, it hurts here.

647
01:10:51,113 --> 01:10:55,015
怕是练功练坏了，给我自己服的
Must be from the practising. It's for myself.

648
01:10:56,452 --> 01:10:57,851
你这里疼？
Hurts here?

649
01:10:57,953 --> 01:10:59,284
是
Yes.

650
01:11:00,155 --> 01:11:03,921
你倒有先见之明知道自己胸口会疼
Interesting that you can foresee your own injuries.

651
01:11:05,561 --> 01:11:07,825
快说，给谁治伤的？
Speak up! Who's that for?

652
01:11:07,930 --> 01:11:09,420
是给我自己
For myself.

653
01:11:14,370 --> 01:11:17,567
除了胸口你还有什么地方疼？
Where else does it hurt?

654
01:11:20,676 --> 01:11:26,239
这里疼，不…哪儿也不疼了
Here... no... nowhere.

655
01:11:26,348 --> 01:11:27,940
那你买药干什么？
What's the medicine for?

656
01:11:28,050 --> 01:11:30,245
洪举官才要这种汤药的
Only Hong Xiguan would need a prescription like that.

657
01:11:45,167 --> 01:11:48,330
朱财，带提督大人去找洪举官
Zhu Cai, if you show Official Gao to Hong Xiguan,

658
01:11:48,437 --> 01:11:50,132
是大功一件
that's a merit.

659
01:11:51,940 --> 01:11:54,568
洪举官在哪里？快说
Speak up! Where is Hong Xiguan?

660
01:11:55,844 --> 01:11:59,211
我看他鬼头鬼脑在豆腐店里进出
He sneaks around in the tofu shop,

661
01:11:59,315 --> 01:12:01,749
说不定洪举官就藏在豆腐店里
I think Hong Xiguan could be there.

662
01:12:01,850 --> 01:12:04,842
不，洪举官不在豆腐店…
No! He's not!

663
01:12:05,354 --> 01:12:08,221
小子，你不打自招了
Alright! You did us a favour.

664
01:12:18,901 --> 01:12:19,993
你是什么人？
Who are you?

665
01:12:20,102 --> 01:12:22,002
放开我，我是老板
Let me go! I'm the boss.

666
01:12:27,810 --> 01:12:28,936
陈阿金，快溜
Chen Ajin, run!

667
01:12:30,312 --> 01:12:31,244
站住
Freeze.

668
01:13:08,951 --> 01:13:11,215
洪举官在哪里？快说
Where's Hong Xiguan? Speak up.

669
01:13:11,720 --> 01:13:13,017
在你姥姥家里
At your grandma's.

670
01:13:30,572 --> 01:13:33,666
你，这怎么行？
You! You can't do that

671
01:13:36,078 --> 01:13:37,511
这还差不多
This is more likely.

672
01:13:40,449 --> 01:13:42,007
我们来放火趁乱救人
Set a fire! And we can save them.

673
01:14:06,508 --> 01:14:08,237
他们两个在下面，我们在放火
They're below. We're setting a fire.

674
01:14:08,343 --> 01:14:09,605
快走…
Run!

675
01:14:17,953 --> 01:14:21,150
别乱，走，追
Don't panic! Run! Go!

676
01:14:27,296 --> 01:14:30,823
快走啊…
Run!

677
01:14:39,074 --> 01:14:40,268
往那边跑了，快追啊
Over there! Go!

678
01:14:40,375 --> 01:14:41,501
追
Go!

679
01:14:46,048 --> 01:14:47,106
到哪儿去？
Where to?

680
01:14:47,216 --> 01:14:49,184
染房就在这儿，我们进去躲一躲
The dye factory is right here, let's hide inside.

681
01:14:49,284 --> 01:14:50,512
不行，官兵一到
No, when they arrive,

682
01:14:50,619 --> 01:14:52,678
一定会料到我们躲到染房去
they would know that we're hiding there.

683
01:14:53,655 --> 01:14:56,089
我们到周成的武馆去躲一躲
We should hide in Zhou Cheng's martial arts school.

684
01:14:56,191 --> 01:14:57,453
好主意，走
Good idea!

685
01:15:00,028 --> 01:15:02,622
来了，恭喜提督抓住了洪举官
Here you are! Congratulations on catching Hong Xiguan,

686
01:15:02,731 --> 01:15:04,596
替朝廷立了大功
what an achievement!

687
01:15:06,034 --> 01:15:07,160
我来倒是来了
Well, I'm here.

688
01:15:07,269 --> 01:15:09,032
不过不是叫人抓来的
But no one caught me.

689
01:15:10,806 --> 01:15:13,366
你别去，免得到时候你为难
You stay here. It's better for you.

690
01:15:18,780 --> 01:15:21,248
好酒好菜
What a meal!

691
01:15:35,864 --> 01:15:37,058
别糟蹋了好酒好菜
Let's not ruin it.

692
01:15:37,165 --> 01:15:38,154
是啊
That's right.

693
01:16:20,442 --> 01:16:21,841
朱财在染房工作
Zhu Cai works in the dye factory,

694
01:16:21,944 --> 01:16:23,673
他一定藏在染房里头
he must be hiding in there.

695
01:16:27,916 --> 01:16:34,583
他们在武馆，师傅…
They're in the school, the master...

696
01:16:39,227 --> 01:16:42,492
小心点，你带头
Careful. After you!

697
01:16:42,598 --> 01:16:43,587
我？
Me?

698
01:16:43,699 --> 01:16:44,859
快去
Go!

699
01:17:18,500 --> 01:17:19,865
原来早走了
They're gone.

700
01:17:21,236 --> 01:17:23,830
喂，放心进来，没有人
Hey! Come on in! No one's here.

701
01:17:25,040 --> 01:17:27,531
我进去看看你们跟我来
I'll take a look first, follow me.

702
01:17:33,615 --> 01:17:36,243
这小子怎么忽然胆子大起来了？
How come he's suddenly acting so brave?

703
01:17:36,952 --> 01:17:40,410
人都走了，胆子还不大？
They're gone, of course he would.

704
01:17:41,223 --> 01:17:42,850
里边没有人
It's clear.

705
01:17:55,270 --> 01:17:57,966
那面就是染房，不知道他们在不在
Next door is the dye factory, wonder if they're there.

706
01:18:07,649 --> 01:18:10,550
灯火都没有，大概都逃了
No lights. Guess they must have fled.

707
01:18:10,652 --> 01:18:13,450
提督大人，我遇事勇敢向前
Official Gao, I'm being brave,

708
01:18:13,555 --> 01:18:15,352
该记一功吧
I deserve a credit.

709
01:18:18,727 --> 01:18:20,661
好，记你一功
Sure, you do.

710
01:18:25,033 --> 01:18:26,432
他们在墙那边
They're over there at the wall.

711
01:18:26,535 --> 01:18:29,003
他们在暗，我们在明
They're in the dark.

712
01:18:29,104 --> 01:18:32,335
天黑地形不熟，攻过去会吃亏的
Unfamiliarity with the settings is to our disadvantage.

713
01:18:32,441 --> 01:18:35,467
曾世光就是榜样
Zeng Shiguang is an example.

714
01:18:35,577 --> 01:18:36,805
快去衙门调动人马
Go to the magistrate's office and get some manpower.

715
01:18:36,912 --> 01:18:38,106
把所有出路封死
Block all the exits.

716
01:18:38,213 --> 01:18:39,646
是
Yes.

717
01:18:42,617 --> 01:18:44,676
兵还是要调
We indeed need the manpower.

718
01:18:44,786 --> 01:18:48,779
不过现在深更半夜我怕打草惊蛇
But it's late in the night, I'd rather not alert them.

719
01:18:48,890 --> 01:18:50,949
一来没跟官府联络
And besides, we haven't contacted the magistrate,

720
01:18:51,059 --> 01:18:54,495
只怕不到天亮人马不易调集
I worry that we can't get any help until daybreak.

721
01:18:54,596 --> 01:18:56,587
暂时只好虚张声势
All we can do is bluff for now,

722
01:18:56,698 --> 01:18:59,223
等天亮再调集兵马
we'll get the men in the morning.

723
01:19:05,474 --> 01:19:07,408
他们怎么还不攻过来？
Why don't they attack?

724
01:19:07,776 --> 01:19:08,538
我们熄灭了灯火
There's no light.

725
01:19:08,643 --> 01:19:11,703
黑夜之间他们地形不熟不敢攻过来
They wouldn't dare to attack in the dark.

726
01:19:12,114 --> 01:19:14,275
弓箭手守左边见人就射
The archers on the left, shoot when you spot anyone.

727
01:19:14,382 --> 01:19:16,942
刀斧手守右边见人就砍
Soldiers with axes on the right, chop if you see anyone

728
01:19:18,920 --> 01:19:21,320
我们一夜不断骚扰他们
We'll keep disturbing them over the night.

729
01:19:21,423 --> 01:19:24,449
令他们不能睡，也不敢逃
That way, they can't sleep and dare not escape.

730
01:19:24,559 --> 01:19:26,049
等天明再攻
We'll launch a proper attack tomorrow.

731
01:19:52,487 --> 01:19:54,045
我看都是虚张声势
I think it's just a bluff,

732
01:19:54,156 --> 01:19:56,090
不过还是要做好准备
but we need to be prepared.

733
01:20:14,910 --> 01:20:17,344
掌力有阴力阳力之分
The power of the palm is different between yin & yang.

734
01:20:17,445 --> 01:20:20,881
运气得当掌力阴阳自若
After controlling your "Qi" right, you can master it.

735
01:20:20,982 --> 01:20:22,745
阿金，你来试试
Ah Jin, you try.

736
01:20:29,457 --> 01:20:32,017
你气集的还不够，再来
You're not focused enough... once again.

737
01:20:50,178 --> 01:20:52,009
这样就差不多了
That's better.

738
01:21:10,932 --> 01:21:12,024
不错
Not bad.

739
01:21:16,371 --> 01:21:18,669
反贼听着，官兵已经团团围住
Listen up, traitors! You've been surrounded.

740
01:21:18,773 --> 01:21:21,333
这里就是你们葬身之地了
This is where you'll die.

741
01:21:22,744 --> 01:21:24,974
阿金，不行
Ah Jin, no!

742
01:21:37,993 --> 01:21:40,018
周成这桌酒席让我全搬来了
I brought Zhou Cheng's feast here.

743
01:21:40,128 --> 01:21:41,857
大家开怀畅饮吧
Let's have a good meal!

744
01:21:41,963 --> 01:21:43,931
对呀，反正一有人过来
That's right. If someone comes close,

745
01:21:44,032 --> 01:21:45,932
那个板会有声音的
we can hear.

746
01:21:46,268 --> 01:21:48,566
我把兵器架都搬过来了
I'll move all the weapons here.

747
01:21:49,004 --> 01:21:51,598
我看不如把兵器先藏起来
I think we should hide them first.

748
01:22:01,116 --> 01:22:02,674
来，坐
Come on.

749
01:22:07,122 --> 01:22:09,647
别看刚才我们脱身容易
Let's not congratulate ourselves for escaping earlier;

750
01:22:09,758 --> 01:22:12,022
那是高进忠他们一时轻敌
It's only because Gao Jinzhong's gang underestimated us

751
01:22:12,127 --> 01:22:14,527
这五个人的武功非同寻常
Those five are very skilled,

752
01:22:14,629 --> 01:22:17,189
后面还有官府的力量
and they're backed by the court.

753
01:22:17,299 --> 01:22:20,291
事情本来和你们一点关系也没有的
You had nothing to do with it,

754
01:22:20,402 --> 01:22:23,667
你们替我治伤我已经感激不尽了
I appreciate that you helped me with my medicine.

755
01:22:23,772 --> 01:22:26,935
三位如果要走的话我绝不见怪
I wouldn't blame you for wanting to leave now.

756
01:22:27,876 --> 01:22:31,334
反正他们的目标也只在我一人身上
I'm their target.

757
01:22:34,149 --> 01:22:37,209
洪举官原来你心里还看不起我们
Hong Xiguan, you despise us.

758
01:22:41,723 --> 01:22:44,089
我洪举官要是对三位有轻视之意
If I meant anything like that,

759
01:22:44,192 --> 01:22:45,887
就天打雷劈
please let me be struck by thunder.

760
01:22:49,664 --> 01:22:52,895
刚才是我说错话了，三位不要见怪
I was wrong, please forgive me.

761
01:22:53,001 --> 01:22:56,528
来，坐
Come on, sit.

762
01:23:03,278 --> 01:23:05,269
能认识三位这样的好朋友
I'm honoured to have friends like you.

763
01:23:05,380 --> 01:23:07,507
真是生平的快事
This is certainly something to celebrate for.

764
01:23:08,183 --> 01:23:09,650
长夜漫漫
It's a long night.

765
01:23:09,751 --> 01:23:13,118
不如我们一边喝酒一边谈论武功
Let's drink and talk about martial arts.

766
01:23:13,221 --> 01:23:14,245
来
Come!

767
01:23:16,124 --> 01:23:17,523
请洪大哥指教
Brother Hong, please teach us.

768
01:23:19,594 --> 01:23:23,428
白眉道人的武功是出于武当
Earlier on, Priest White Brows learnt from Wudang Clan;

769
01:23:23,531 --> 01:23:25,726
高进忠是他的首徒
Gao Jinzhong remains his best student.

770
01:23:25,834 --> 01:23:29,099
听说他师徒二人有意自创白眉一派
I hear they're hoping to build up a White Brows Clan.

771
01:23:29,204 --> 01:23:32,469
我们第一个要当心的人就是高进忠
We must watch out for Gao Jinzhong first,

772
01:23:32,574 --> 01:23:34,405
特别是要留心他的辫子
especially his braid.

773
01:23:35,810 --> 01:23:37,937
所谓知己知彼
Know your enemy!

774
01:23:38,046 --> 01:23:41,573
还有邹风的盾单刀，阴森快捷
Zou Feng's sword strikes fast and sneaky.

775
01:23:43,251 --> 01:23:46,379
他以盾牌护身不易攻得进去
He has a shield to protect himself.

776
01:23:46,488 --> 01:23:48,888
还要留心他的单刀穿盾而出
Watch out for his sword breaking through the shield,

777
01:23:48,990 --> 01:23:50,355
防不胜防
that's his trick.

778
01:23:54,763 --> 01:23:56,526
范天聪力大无穷
Fan Tiancong is a man with massive strength.

779
01:23:56,631 --> 01:23:59,429
现在打墙的想必是他
I think he's the one hitting the wall now.

780
01:24:02,504 --> 01:24:05,029
他每一锤有三百斤力道以上
Each strike is deadly,

781
01:24:05,140 --> 01:24:07,370
绝不可以与他硬碰硬
we must think of a way to deal with him.

782
01:24:13,314 --> 01:24:15,874
闷死了，过去看看怎么样
So boring! Let's check them!

783
01:24:15,984 --> 01:24:16,450
好
Sure.

784
01:24:16,551 --> 01:24:17,950
好，你接应我
You cover for me.

785
01:24:34,969 --> 01:24:35,993
走
Go!

786
01:24:42,277 --> 01:24:45,508
这就是白眉双童的虎童和豹童
They are the Tiger Kid and Leopard Kid.

787
01:24:45,613 --> 01:24:48,810
虎童拳脚功夫很辣，劲力极足
Tiger Kid has a deadly kick.

788
01:24:51,986 --> 01:24:55,046
豹童的金钢圈武艺非凡
Leopard Kid kills with the copper ring.

789
01:24:55,957 --> 01:24:59,552
尤其是别看他们是小孩子
Don't think that they're just kids,

790
01:24:59,661 --> 01:25:01,993
出手阴毒，千万小心
they're very vicious. You must be careful.

791
01:25:16,711 --> 01:25:19,612
官兵已在聚集，很快就可以赶到了
The soldiers are gathering, they'll be here soon.

792
01:28:09,884 --> 01:28:12,580
慢着，来呀
Wait. Come on.

793
01:29:45,346 --> 01:29:46,335
来
Come on.

794
01:30:01,295 --> 01:30:02,523
喝一杯
Have a drink.

795
01:30:10,872 --> 01:30:12,897
这叫什么功夫？
What style is this?

796
01:30:13,007 --> 01:30:15,237
这叫黑虎门功夫
The Black Tiger Clan's style.

797
01:32:07,588 --> 01:32:08,816
朱财…
Zhu Cai...

798
01:32:10,958 --> 01:32:12,892
朱财…
Zhu Cai...

799
01:39:20,354 --> 01:39:22,720
大宝…
Dabao...

800
01:40:23,484 --> 01:40:25,076
洪大哥，官兵到了
Brother Hong, the soldiers are here!

801
01:40:25,185 --> 01:40:27,710
你和韩七走，我来挡住
Leave with Han Qi, I'll stay behind.

802
01:40:28,756 --> 01:40:29,381
不行
No!

803
01:40:29,490 --> 01:40:31,549
反正我已经受了伤
I'm injured anyway.

804
01:40:31,892 --> 01:40:34,326
快点走，再不走就来不及了
Leave now! Or you won't make it!

805
01:40:34,428 --> 01:40:35,725
我们在这儿挡着
We'll stay behind and block them.

806
01:40:35,829 --> 01:40:37,228
阿金伤得也很厉害
Jin's badly injured too.

807
01:40:37,331 --> 01:40:40,892
大家都要留下来送死，谁来干大事
If we all die, who's going to complete the mission?

808
01:40:41,001 --> 01:40:42,093
快点走啊
Run!

809
01:40:42,936 --> 01:40:43,868
走
Run!

810
01:40:54,982 --> 01:40:56,074
放箭
Shoot!

811
01:41:03,891 --> 01:41:08,225
大宝，人生一世算没白活
Dabao, we lived life to the fullest.

812
01:41:09,563 --> 01:41:11,155
很过瘾.是不是？
Fun, isn't it?
