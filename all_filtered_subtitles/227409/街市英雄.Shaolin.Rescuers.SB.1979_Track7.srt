Stop!

20

Move over!

21
00:07:09,629 --> 00:07:11,392
It's already mid-day,

22
00:07:11,497 --> 00:07:12,657
why aren't you working?

23
00:07:12,765 --> 00:07:13,754
What are you doing?

24
00:07:13,866 --> 00:07:16,300
What do you know except eating?

25
00:07:16,402 --> 00:07:19,098
Boss, I woke up almost at midnight
to make tofu,

26
00:07:19,205 --> 00:07:21,503
and I didn't get a break.

27
00:07:21,607 --> 00:07:24,542
That's the point of hiring you;

28
00:07:24,644 --> 00:07:28,239
Working non-stop.

29
00:07:30,783 --> 00:07:32,410
I quit. You can do it.

30
00:07:32,718 --> 00:07:34,117
Jin.

31
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:42,458
Please.

32
00:07:44,096 --> 00:07:45,563
Move over, the tofu.

33
00:07:48,701 --> 00:07:53,798
Jin... l...

34
00:07:57,610 --> 00:07:59,305
Guess I could at least wipe off the sweat.

35
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:06,410
Boss Huang, I don't think he's idling,

36
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:07,543
agree?

37
00:08:10,923 --> 00:08:12,618
Careful, Boss Huang.

38
00:08:12,725 --> 00:08:14,090
If you can't hold it,

39
00:08:14,193 --> 00:08:17,162
then it will be a disaster.

40
00:08:17,263 --> 00:08:20,289
Jin, come help!

41
00:08:21,234 --> 00:08:22,599
Coming...

42
00:08:24,804 --> 00:08:28,331
Yes, boss?

43
00:08:36,382 --> 00:08:38,680
Boss Huang, don't blame Jin
that he's not working.

44
00:08:38,784 --> 00:08:40,775
I'm here to buy some tofu.

45
00:09:00,106 --> 00:09:03,371
Yang Dabao, you want me to fire you?

46
00:09:03,476 --> 00:09:05,137
You took quite a while to buy tofu!

47
00:09:05,244 --> 00:09:07,508
I've got a restaurant to run here.

48
00:09:07,613 --> 00:09:10,741
Yes, boss. Well, I'm back now.

49
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:12,442
Set the tables.

50
00:09:14,787 --> 00:09:16,687
Excuse me, boss.

51
00:09:16,789 --> 00:09:19,849
I need to bring these to the kitchen.

52
00:09:25,498 --> 00:09:27,898
Hurry up!

53
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:53,058
This way please.
What would you like to eat?

54
00:09:53,159 --> 00:09:54,922
Two bowls of beef noodles.

55
00:09:55,027 --> 00:09:55,516
Right away.

56
00:09:55,628 --> 00:09:57,789
Two bowls of beef noodles.

57
00:10:18,818 --> 00:10:22,777
Welcome. What would you like?

58
00:10:22,888 --> 00:10:28,121
Steamed beef, steamed egg
and some wine. Hurry!

59
00:10:30,329 --> 00:10:31,819
Please have a seat.

60
00:10:35,334 --> 00:10:35,823
Welcome.

61
00:10:35,935 --> 00:10:36,424
A dish of chicken.

62
00:10:36,535 --> 00:10:38,025
Okay

63
00:10:40,706 --> 00:10:43,402
Hey! I'm in a rush here! Hurry up!

64
00:10:43,509 --> 00:10:47,741
Yes... can't you hear?

65
00:10:47,847 --> 00:10:49,872
Bring the dishes to them first.

66
00:10:50,449 --> 00:10:52,076
Got it.

67
00:11:04,697 --> 00:11:07,461
Coming. Hurry!

68
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:16,433
Sorry, sir.

69
00:11:16,542 --> 00:11:19,033
I was careless.

70
00:11:21,814 --> 00:11:22,781
The nose.

71
00:11:26,652 --> 00:11:28,847
Get up. Sorry.

72
00:11:52,278 --> 00:11:55,111
Boss, there's a fly on this chicken leg,

73
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:55,771
should I throw it away?

74
00:11:55,881 --> 00:11:57,542
Throw it away?

75
00:11:57,650 --> 00:12:01,142
Get rid of the fly, and give it to them.

76
00:12:09,495 --> 00:12:11,520
Hey, what's wrong with this?

77
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:14,064
Don't worry. There's a fly here,

78
00:12:14,166 --> 00:12:16,430
the boss told me to get rid of it.

79
00:12:16,535 --> 00:12:18,901
Don't worry, eat up.

80
00:12:19,004 --> 00:12:20,904
How can I eat it?

81
00:12:21,006 --> 00:12:22,337
Our food is very clean here.

82
00:12:22,441 --> 00:12:24,773
Don't listen to him.

83
00:12:24,877 --> 00:12:26,037
Gentlemen.

84
00:12:30,683 --> 00:12:34,016
Be sure to lock the shop up.

85
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,678
Clean up everything.

86
00:12:35,788 --> 00:12:37,278
Soak the beans for tomorrow.

87
00:12:37,389 --> 00:12:39,084
Wake up early to grind the beans.

88
00:12:40,092 --> 00:12:42,686
What now?
Are you trying to wreck the shop?

89
00:12:43,195 --> 00:12:45,095
When you're done, start to boil the juice.

90
00:12:45,197 --> 00:12:46,164
When you've boiled the juice,

91
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:48,495
make some tofu and dried tofu.

92
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:51,764
And you can deep-fry some,
don't try to slack off.

93
00:12:51,871 --> 00:12:53,805
If I find out,
I'll deduct it from your pay.

94
00:12:53,906 --> 00:12:56,101
If you break anything,
that's coming off your pay too.

95
00:12:56,208 --> 00:12:59,405
And if you open the shop late,
I'll deduct your pay.

96
00:12:59,512 --> 00:13:00,604
Yes.

97
00:13:29,542 --> 00:13:32,477
It's strange! Why do I trip everyday?

98
00:13:56,735 --> 00:13:57,724
Yang Dabao.

99
00:14:02,141 --> 00:14:03,233
Yang Dabao.

100
00:14:10,115 --> 00:14:11,582
What are you doing up there?

101
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:16,378
Let me see what your

102
00:14:16,488 --> 00:14:20,151
Black Tiger Clan's
martial arts style is all about

103
00:14:30,302 --> 00:14:35,433
What do you know?
This is the fairy's bowl.

104
00:14:35,975 --> 00:14:39,035
I think it's more like a beggar's bowl.

105
00:14:43,249 --> 00:14:45,649
Alright. If you can snatch
this beggar's bowl,

106
00:14:45,751 --> 00:14:47,218
you're in for a yummy treat.

107
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:03,626
Wear it.

108
00:15:57,856 --> 00:15:59,323
I've got it!

109
00:15:59,425 --> 00:16:00,790
Yummy food!

110
00:16:04,563 --> 00:16:05,495
Very well.

111
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:39,021
Do you believe that
with this pair of chopsticks

112
00:16:39,131 --> 00:16:40,325
I can stop you from eating?

113
00:16:40,432 --> 00:16:42,798
You don't have a chance to eat anything.

114
00:16:46,305 --> 00:16:47,567
When I was learning martial arts
from my dad,

115
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:49,334
that's what he did.

116
00:16:49,441 --> 00:16:51,636
For over half a year, I ate plain rice.

117
00:16:52,344 --> 00:16:53,811
The main feature of the martial arts
of my family,

118
00:16:53,912 --> 00:16:54,708
the Black Tiger Clan is that,

119
00:16:54,813 --> 00:16:56,405
we can pick up anything handy beside us,

120
00:16:56,515 --> 00:16:58,710
and use it as a weapon.

121
00:16:58,817 --> 00:17:00,409
While we're eating...

122
00:17:27,413 --> 00:17:30,143
Ain't very nice to eat plain rice
for over six months.

123
00:17:30,249 --> 00:17:31,511
Definitely not.

124
00:17:31,617 --> 00:17:34,814
But when my dad couldn't stop me...

125
00:18:16,795 --> 00:18:18,262
Do you get it?

126
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:22,530
Swallow first, then chew later.

127
00:18:25,204 --> 00:18:26,535
For the Black Tiger Clan's martial arts,

128
00:18:26,638 --> 00:18:29,266
we can pick up anything handy beside us,

129
00:18:29,374 --> 00:18:31,001
and use it as a weapon.

130
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:32,441
That's really something.

131
00:18:32,878 --> 00:18:34,140
Don't be modest.

132
00:18:34,246 --> 00:18:37,409
The Mantis Style you're learning
is very difficult too.

133
00:18:37,516 --> 00:18:40,314
I've never heard about your master.

134
00:18:41,687 --> 00:18:43,678
I don't know who he is.

135
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:46,553
How can that be?

136
00:18:46,658 --> 00:18:50,424
I met my master three years ago.

137
00:18:51,296 --> 00:18:52,763
I was still in my hometown then

138
00:18:59,838 --> 00:19:04,275
Kid, c'mon address me as "grandpa"
and I'll let you go.

139
00:19:04,376 --> 00:19:05,604
Bastard!

140
00:19:06,311 --> 00:19:07,801
Come on, kid!

141
00:19:07,913 --> 00:19:09,073
Bastard!

142
00:19:29,067 --> 00:19:32,230
Spare us, "grandpa"!

143
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:40,839
Master.

144
00:21:12,904 --> 00:21:14,269
Try this.

145
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:35,053
My master left after two years.

146
00:21:35,927 --> 00:21:38,623
I didn't even know his name.

147
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:46,237
That's a true master.

148
00:21:56,715 --> 00:21:58,273
Both of us have skills,

149
00:21:58,383 --> 00:21:59,873
I don't know how long

150
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:02,783
we must wait
to become something in this field

151
00:22:02,888 --> 00:22:04,788
that we can do something great!

152
00:22:05,624 --> 00:22:08,218
I'd risk my life for that day!

153
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:09,316
Great!

154
00:22:13,532 --> 00:22:15,227
We both want to be heroes,

155
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:15,857
we just don't know

156
00:22:15,967 --> 00:22:17,798
when that will happen.

157
00:22:17,903 --> 00:22:19,063
I can't wait.

158
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:22,864
It will happen one of these days.

159
00:22:24,676 --> 00:22:26,610
Alright! A fight!

160
00:22:44,296 --> 00:22:45,228
Get even!

161
00:23:19,798 --> 00:23:21,356
I'm going to faint.

162
00:23:25,771 --> 00:23:27,136
And you said you want to be a hero,

163
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:29,207
you can't let go of this wine.

164
00:23:29,975 --> 00:23:32,409
It's not me, it's my boss.

165
00:23:32,511 --> 00:23:34,706
I still need ajob before I become a hero.

166
00:23:34,813 --> 00:23:35,837
Right?

167
00:23:42,421 --> 00:23:43,319
Go to sleep.

168
00:23:43,422 --> 00:23:45,822
You need to get up to work
in the middle of the night.

169
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:06,771
"Qingyun Temple"

170
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:12,474
Hong Xiguan.

171
00:24:12,584 --> 00:24:14,176
"Master Zhishan, Shaolin Monastery"

172
00:24:17,556 --> 00:24:18,352
Brother Hong.

173
00:24:18,457 --> 00:24:20,186
"Fang Shiyu, Shaolin disciple"

174
00:24:21,193 --> 00:24:24,060
"Fang Meiyu"

175
00:24:24,463 --> 00:24:27,489
"Fang Xiaoyu"

176
00:24:28,133 --> 00:24:29,293
Help him up.

177
00:24:29,835 --> 00:24:30,893
"Master Xinglong, Lama Clan"

178
00:24:31,002 --> 00:24:33,630
Don't move him, help him to sit up.

179
00:24:50,055 --> 00:24:51,522
Master Zhishan.

180
00:24:51,623 --> 00:24:54,353
Xiguan, you have
serious internal injuries.

181
00:24:54,459 --> 00:24:56,586
This is Master Xinglong of Lama Clan.

182
00:24:56,695 --> 00:24:59,391
He's a healer, don't move.

183
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:01,966
Master, the West Meditation Temple
has been torn apart

184
00:25:02,067 --> 00:25:05,628
by White Brows Priest,
Gao Jinzhong and the others.

185
00:25:06,371 --> 00:25:12,105
Brother Sande, Tong Qianjin, Nian Ruiqing,

186
00:25:12,210 --> 00:25:14,940
Li Jinlun, Hu Weigan... they're all dead.

187
00:25:15,046 --> 00:25:17,207
Being emotional is
the cause of internal injuries.

188
00:25:17,315 --> 00:25:20,842
Inhale.

189
00:25:23,822 --> 00:25:25,585
I understand.

190
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:28,818
They will come to
Qingyun Temple eventually.

191
00:25:28,927 --> 00:25:33,421
You're badly injured,
it will take some time to heal.

192
00:25:33,532 --> 00:25:37,662
My student Zhou Cheng
runs a martial arts school.

193
00:25:37,769 --> 00:25:41,728
You can look for him,
and he can take care of you.

194
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:45,071
If White Brows and Gao Jinzhong come here,

195
00:25:45,176 --> 00:25:46,438
I've to put up a fight with them.

196
00:25:46,545 --> 00:25:50,948
You can't help in your state.
You should leave soon.

197
00:25:51,049 --> 00:25:54,314
Han Qi works as an acrobat
with a theatre troupe.

198
00:25:54,419 --> 00:25:55,852
You can contact him.

199
00:25:57,355 --> 00:25:59,346
Our Tibetan Lama Clan
don't want to get involved

200
00:25:59,457 --> 00:26:03,484
in the fight between the Court
and Shaolin, goodbye.

201
00:26:04,396 --> 00:26:06,364
Wait. I'll give you a prescription.

202
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:07,726
Yes.

203
00:26:10,602 --> 00:26:14,038
Shiyu, pack some clothes
and money for Xiguan.

204
00:26:14,139 --> 00:26:15,299
Yes.

205
00:26:17,943 --> 00:26:20,036
I'll stay here temporarily

206
00:26:20,145 --> 00:26:21,908
with Shiyu, Meiyu and Xiaoyu.

207
00:26:22,013 --> 00:26:23,844
After we've gathered
the rest of the students,

208
00:26:23,949 --> 00:26:25,507
we'll contact Han Qi and yourself.

209
00:26:25,617 --> 00:26:26,777
Yes, master.

210
00:26:36,428 --> 00:26:37,759
I could walk some distance with you.

211
00:26:37,862 --> 00:26:40,092
I'll tell you how to get to Zhou Cheng.

212
00:26:46,204 --> 00:26:47,466
"Zhou Cheng Martial Arts School"

213
00:26:47,973 --> 00:26:49,497
"Lama Clan"

214
00:27:05,557 --> 00:27:09,288
These are different from the usual setup.

215
00:27:09,394 --> 00:27:11,385
Ours is based on
the Big Dipper constellation.

216
00:27:11,496 --> 00:27:15,432
Forty nine in total,
all different in height.

217
00:27:15,567 --> 00:27:16,966
You all know that.

218
00:27:17,068 --> 00:27:18,501
Yes.

219
00:27:18,603 --> 00:27:20,571
Practise hard

220
00:27:20,672 --> 00:27:22,071
from what I have taught you.

221
00:27:22,173 --> 00:27:23,299
Yes.

222
00:28:19,130 --> 00:28:21,792
Good! Continue practising!

223
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:24,869
After a certain time, it won't feel

224
00:28:24,969 --> 00:28:27,403
any different up there
from what it's on the ground

225
00:28:29,941 --> 00:28:31,738
Where's Zhu Cai?

226
00:28:36,114 --> 00:28:37,376
Master.

227
00:28:38,149 --> 00:28:39,639
Wait.

228
00:28:39,751 --> 00:28:42,311
You're late.
Do you take your lesson seriously?

229
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:43,785
It's very busy at the dye factory today.

230
00:28:43,888 --> 00:28:47,221
I rushed here as soon as I could leave.

231
00:28:47,325 --> 00:28:49,452
Then you should head back.

232
00:28:50,361 --> 00:28:54,525
You can never learn the way you are.

233
00:28:54,632 --> 00:28:57,430
I'm ashamed that

234
00:28:57,535 --> 00:28:59,366
you're my student.

235
00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:09,246
Look! He tries to hit me.

236
00:29:10,915 --> 00:29:13,577
Hey! The master sent you
back to the dye factory.

237
00:29:13,685 --> 00:29:14,845
What are you doing here still?

238
00:29:14,953 --> 00:29:17,444
I'll leave after I've practised.

239
00:29:17,555 --> 00:29:18,817
Practise on the Big Dipper poles?

240
00:29:18,923 --> 00:29:22,723
Very well. Come on!

241
00:29:22,827 --> 00:29:25,057
It's easy to get injured there.

242
00:29:25,163 --> 00:29:28,257
I dare not hurt you.

243
00:29:29,834 --> 00:29:31,768
Do you honestly think you can?

244
00:29:34,706 --> 00:29:36,071
Go up!

245
00:29:37,175 --> 00:29:40,167
Look how he listens to me!

246
00:30:21,319 --> 00:30:24,186
Zhu Cai, what on earth are you doing?

247
00:30:24,289 --> 00:30:27,816
How could you be so severe
on your classmate?

248
00:30:31,329 --> 00:30:33,024
Master, he...

249
00:30:33,965 --> 00:30:37,332
You think you've mastered it, don't you?

250
00:30:37,802 --> 00:30:40,327
Fine, challenge me.

251
00:30:40,438 --> 00:30:41,996
I dare not to, master.

252
00:30:49,614 --> 00:30:51,309
Jin, I'm off.

253
00:30:52,150 --> 00:30:55,210
Stand still, Zhu Cai.

254
00:31:02,927 --> 00:31:05,691
Listen up! Beat him up!

255
00:31:05,797 --> 00:31:08,925
I'll pay a tael of silver
for every punch and kick!

256
00:31:25,216 --> 00:31:27,150
Hey! Why didn't you fight back?

257
00:31:27,252 --> 00:31:29,618
You must try your best
even if there's no hope to win.

258
00:31:31,322 --> 00:31:34,291
Come on! You'll get paid.

259
00:31:35,159 --> 00:31:37,593
One punch, you owe me a tael.

260
00:31:40,965 --> 00:31:43,195
Five punches,
six taels of silver all together.

261
00:32:01,252 --> 00:32:02,947
Can you afford it?

262
00:32:03,054 --> 00:32:07,491
One hundred and thirty four taels. Pay up.

263
00:32:12,397 --> 00:32:13,887
One hundred and fifty.

264
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:17,758
One hundred and seventy eight.

265
00:32:19,537 --> 00:32:21,528
One hundred and ninety,
one hundred and ninety eight.

266
00:32:21,639 --> 00:32:23,231
One hundred and ninety nine.

267
00:32:26,511 --> 00:32:27,876
Two hundred!

268
00:32:33,851 --> 00:32:35,148
Run.

269
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:39,353
Thanks, they're all my classmates
at the kung fu school

270
00:32:39,457 --> 00:32:41,482
Please stop.

271
00:33:07,352 --> 00:33:08,842
What kind of a master is he?

272
00:33:08,953 --> 00:33:10,818
A rich person won't necessarily
learn well.

273
00:33:10,922 --> 00:33:14,358
I think you're better than
the rest of them.

274
00:33:20,164 --> 00:33:23,759
I've learnt martial arts
on the Big Dipper Poles.

275
00:33:23,868 --> 00:33:26,837
Big Dipper Poles? Where?

276
00:33:59,437 --> 00:34:01,632
Let's have some fun.

277
00:34:07,278 --> 00:34:08,905
I lost my balance.

278
00:34:20,358 --> 00:34:22,053
My turn!

279
00:35:01,666 --> 00:35:03,861
Very well! You rule on the poles.

280
00:35:03,968 --> 00:35:06,732
But I'm better at the restaurant.

281
00:35:08,239 --> 00:35:11,436
And I'm the best in the tofu shop.

282
00:35:20,751 --> 00:35:22,309
"Qingyun Temple."

283
00:35:29,527 --> 00:35:30,789
Han Qi?

284
00:35:32,363 --> 00:35:34,331
I sent Hong Xiguan to contact you!

285
00:35:34,432 --> 00:35:35,126
What are you doing here?

286
00:35:35,233 --> 00:35:37,531
Master Zhishan,
it's very dangerous out there.

287
00:35:37,635 --> 00:35:38,602
I'm here to inform you.

288
00:35:38,703 --> 00:35:41,001
I know, just head back.

289
00:35:41,105 --> 00:35:43,596
Hong Xiguan is injured,
you must hurry and find him.

290
00:35:43,708 --> 00:35:45,107
We're staying here temporarily.

291
00:35:45,209 --> 00:35:47,177
After the rest of the members are here,

292
00:35:47,278 --> 00:35:50,577
I'll contact you, go!

293
00:35:50,948 --> 00:35:51,778
Leave at the back door.

294
00:35:51,883 --> 00:35:53,009
Alright.

295
00:35:55,353 --> 00:35:57,617
I worry about Brother Hong's injuries.

296
00:36:04,729 --> 00:36:07,163
Old monk, is there a Master Zhishan here?

297
00:36:07,265 --> 00:36:08,289
Good thing that you weren't rude.

298
00:36:08,399 --> 00:36:10,299
This is Master Zhishan.

299
00:36:10,401 --> 00:36:12,562
I didn't expect he'd be so easy to find.

300
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:14,638
You were looking for me?

301
00:36:14,739 --> 00:36:16,502
To kill you.

302
00:36:19,544 --> 00:36:21,444
Old one too tough; guess I will
see to the younger ones.

303
00:36:53,811 --> 00:36:58,214
Zhishan is the head of
those Shaolin members.

304
00:36:58,316 --> 00:37:01,251
His best student is Fang Shiyu.

305
00:37:01,352 --> 00:37:04,947
Tackle Fang Shiyu first;
then we'll both kill Zhishan.

306
00:37:05,056 --> 00:37:07,957
Fang Shiyu's mother Miao Cuihua

307
00:37:08,059 --> 00:37:10,584
soaked him in herbal medicine
when he was young.

308
00:37:13,631 --> 00:37:16,862
It's hard to hurt him with swords
except his crotch.

309
00:37:16,968 --> 00:37:20,199
Try to make him kick,
then I'll take care of it.

310
00:37:20,304 --> 00:37:22,864
For Zhishan,

311
00:37:22,974 --> 00:37:24,373
his weakest parts are his eyes 1and crotch.

312
00:37:24,475 --> 00:37:27,444
Attack his eyes,
so that he'll try to protect them.

313
00:37:27,545 --> 00:37:28,978
Then I'll attack his crotch.

314
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:29,978
Sure

315
00:37:30,081 --> 00:37:31,070
Go!

316
00:38:30,608 --> 00:38:31,768
Zhishan's dead.

317
00:38:31,876 --> 00:38:34,674
Hong Xiguan is the
only Shaolin member left.

318
00:38:34,779 --> 00:38:37,407
He's not a threat, I injured him well.

319
00:38:37,515 --> 00:38:39,176
Gao Jinzhong, you take the four of them,

320
00:38:39,283 --> 00:38:40,307
and try to locate Hong Xiguan.

321
00:38:40,418 --> 00:38:42,386
Kill him once you've found him.

322
00:38:42,486 --> 00:38:43,475
Yes.

323
00:38:46,357 --> 00:38:47,688
Brother Hong.

324
00:38:49,527 --> 00:38:52,462
Brother Wang, you're here alone?

325
00:38:52,563 --> 00:38:55,361
I got parted from others
after we left Shaolin Temple.

326
00:38:55,466 --> 00:38:58,663
I'm still trying to look for
Master Zhishan & the rest.

327
00:38:59,970 --> 00:39:02,666
Many of them died in
West Meditation Temple.

328
00:39:02,773 --> 00:39:06,402
Zhishan and Brother Fang
are still in Qingyun Temple.

329
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:08,205
I came from there.

330
00:39:08,312 --> 00:39:10,405
Where do you plan to go now?

331
00:39:12,717 --> 00:39:14,708
Are you hurt?

332
00:39:17,021 --> 00:39:21,924
Yes, the master sent me to contact Han Qi.

333
00:39:22,026 --> 00:39:24,460
But when I left Qingyun Temple,

334
00:39:24,562 --> 00:39:26,689
and bid goodbye to Master Xinglong

335
00:39:26,797 --> 00:39:29,129
Gao Jinzhong and his gang
caught up with me.

336
00:39:29,233 --> 00:39:30,700
I'm not sure whether they'll find me here.

337
00:39:30,801 --> 00:39:31,961
Then you had better leave.

338
00:39:32,069 --> 00:39:34,264
If they get here,

339
00:39:34,372 --> 00:39:36,533
I'll deal with them.

340
00:39:37,274 --> 00:39:39,242
At least we're here together,

341
00:39:39,343 --> 00:39:40,776
we'll think of something.

342
00:39:40,878 --> 00:39:41,810
I'm heading off.

343
00:39:41,912 --> 00:39:43,641
Try to find Han Qi.

344
00:39:43,748 --> 00:39:47,684
Yes. Please be careful with your wounds.

345
00:39:47,785 --> 00:39:52,347
I know. You be careful too. I'm off.

346
00:39:57,294 --> 00:39:58,659
Hong Xiguan.

347
00:44:21,025 --> 00:44:22,822
You two!

348
00:45:33,564 --> 00:45:34,053
Come on!

349
00:45:34,164 --> 00:45:35,256
Another round!

350
00:45:37,601 --> 00:45:39,899
Power of a finger.

351
00:45:44,675 --> 00:45:46,040
Get down here.

352
00:46:37,094 --> 00:46:39,062
You're Hong Xiguan?

353
00:46:39,163 --> 00:46:40,187
Yes.

354
00:46:40,564 --> 00:46:43,863
Your master Xinglong sent me here
to meet Master Zhou.

355
00:46:43,967 --> 00:46:45,832
I hope that you could treat me.

356
00:46:46,503 --> 00:46:48,562
We're both in the martial arts world,

357
00:46:48,672 --> 00:46:52,836
you're badly injured
and have met my master.

358
00:46:53,410 --> 00:46:56,345
Yet my school is just a small place;

359
00:46:56,446 --> 00:46:58,311
It has no room for such

360
00:46:58,415 --> 00:47:00,645
a big hero like yourself.

361
00:47:00,751 --> 00:47:03,185
Master Zhou, say no more.

362
00:47:03,287 --> 00:47:06,620
I understand. Goodbye.

363
00:47:10,093 --> 00:47:10,923
Hero Hong.

364
00:47:11,028 --> 00:47:12,359
What are you doing?

365
00:47:32,149 --> 00:47:33,878
Sorry, sir.

366
00:47:39,089 --> 00:47:41,421
Get up!

367
00:47:44,094 --> 00:47:46,426
Yang Dabao, what's wrong with you?

368
00:47:46,530 --> 00:47:47,428
What's wrong with me?

369
00:47:47,531 --> 00:47:48,429
Look at these stools!

370
00:47:48,532 --> 00:47:51,968
They're all in good condition, look!

371
00:47:52,369 --> 00:47:53,393
Good condition?

372
00:47:53,503 --> 00:47:55,232
I don't have any problem with it.

373
00:48:04,648 --> 00:48:07,082
Look! All in one piece.

374
00:48:07,184 --> 00:48:08,617
They just don't know how to sit properly.

375
00:48:10,287 --> 00:48:12,152
Welcome!

376
00:48:30,407 --> 00:48:32,102
Please have a seat.

377
00:48:32,209 --> 00:48:36,976
So, how should I sit?

378
00:48:38,982 --> 00:48:43,214
Sir, you're kidding. You can sit
whatever way you want.

379
00:48:49,426 --> 00:48:53,624
Hurry! Sorry. Take a stool

380
00:48:54,364 --> 00:48:55,763
and put it over there.

381
00:48:56,366 --> 00:48:57,355
Coming.

382
00:49:11,181 --> 00:49:12,705
You...

383
00:49:12,816 --> 00:49:13,805
Beat it.

384
00:49:20,691 --> 00:49:22,352
Black Tiger Clan?

385
00:49:23,660 --> 00:49:25,184
I'm looking for a person named Han Qi,

386
00:49:25,295 --> 00:49:26,887
he works as an acrobat
in the theatre troupe.

387
00:49:26,997 --> 00:49:28,658
Have you heard of him?

388
00:49:28,765 --> 00:49:31,131
Han Qi! I've watched him perform.

389
00:49:31,234 --> 00:49:32,724
His red boat will arrive in a few days.

390
00:49:32,836 --> 00:49:35,703
You seem to be injured.

391
00:49:37,541 --> 00:49:38,906
Sorry, it's none of my business.

392
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:52,618
I'll deduct from your pay
if you slack off,

393
00:49:52,723 --> 00:49:56,090
break anything or open late.

394
00:50:08,538 --> 00:50:14,204
Damn! I must find a monk for a ceremony.

395
00:50:31,828 --> 00:50:35,457
Hey, pal! You knocked off my stuff.

396
00:50:35,565 --> 00:50:38,796
What's the matter?
Can't you walk properly?

397
00:50:38,902 --> 00:50:41,166
I think you're drunk.

398
00:50:41,271 --> 00:50:43,034
Such trouble!

399
00:50:53,316 --> 00:50:55,079
Who are you?

400
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,434
Chen Ajin.

401
00:51:12,536 --> 00:51:13,798
Yang Dabao, come on in.

402
00:51:14,471 --> 00:51:16,962
You want me to do yourjob? Never.

403
00:51:17,074 --> 00:51:19,702
It's different from my martial arts style.

404
00:51:21,745 --> 00:51:22,769
Look.

405
00:51:26,316 --> 00:51:27,943
Who is he? What's he doing here?

406
00:51:28,051 --> 00:51:29,143
You know him?

407
00:51:29,786 --> 00:51:32,721
No. I saw him in the restaurant earlier.

408
00:51:33,156 --> 00:51:34,316
Who is he?

409
00:51:34,424 --> 00:51:35,550
Not too sure myself.

410
00:51:35,659 --> 00:51:38,890
I found this piece of paper on him.
Read it.

411
00:51:46,603 --> 00:51:47,729
Light up!

412
00:51:47,838 --> 00:51:50,500
I can't read anything in the dark.

413
00:52:02,452 --> 00:52:03,976
What does it say?

414
00:52:09,626 --> 00:52:11,116
You are an illiterate too?

415
00:52:14,898 --> 00:52:17,366
I think he must be an important person.

416
00:52:18,802 --> 00:52:20,064
The boss is back.

417
00:52:31,448 --> 00:52:33,177
This prescription was written by
my master's

418
00:52:33,283 --> 00:52:35,410
master, Xinglong.

419
00:52:36,586 --> 00:52:38,213
He's badly injured.

420
00:52:38,321 --> 00:52:39,447
The injured person is inside.

421
00:52:44,594 --> 00:52:45,583
He's Hong Xiguan.

422
00:52:45,695 --> 00:52:47,060
What?

423
00:52:50,133 --> 00:52:51,760
He's Hong Xiguan

424
00:52:51,868 --> 00:52:54,735
The one who's wanted by the Court?

425
00:53:04,447 --> 00:53:05,971
I never expected that we'd have a chance

426
00:53:06,082 --> 00:53:08,744
to meet such a hero.

427
00:53:09,653 --> 00:53:12,781
Looks like he's in a pretty bad state.

428
00:53:12,889 --> 00:53:13,981
I'll get the medicine.

429
00:53:14,090 --> 00:53:17,082
The old master's prescription would work.

430
00:53:19,996 --> 00:53:22,055
Don't let anyone find out though.

431
00:53:23,266 --> 00:53:26,030
I wouldn't mind
sacrificing for Hong Xiguan.

432
00:53:26,136 --> 00:53:28,696
I'd rather be beheaded
than to make tofu my whole life.

433
00:53:28,805 --> 00:53:30,568
"Yan Shou Herbal shop"

434
00:53:33,877 --> 00:53:35,367
How much is it?

435
00:53:35,478 --> 00:53:39,414
Three taels forty five cents each.

436
00:53:40,350 --> 00:53:42,250
Times two, that comes to...

437
00:53:42,352 --> 00:53:45,719
What? It's so expensive.

438
00:53:45,822 --> 00:53:48,313
This isn't an ordinary prescription.

439
00:53:48,425 --> 00:53:50,655
It costs two taels eighty cents for

440
00:53:50,760 --> 00:53:54,423
just the bear's bladder
and rhino's horn powder.

441
00:53:58,301 --> 00:53:59,233
What are you doing?

442
00:53:59,336 --> 00:54:02,305
Keep it for me,
I don't have enough cash, I'll be back.

443
00:54:07,077 --> 00:54:10,877
I only have one tael, what about you?

444
00:54:14,818 --> 00:54:18,549
Don't you have some money
for your future wedding?

445
00:54:18,655 --> 00:54:20,919
Only two taels, I saved up for two years.

446
00:54:21,024 --> 00:54:23,322
Take it out... for saving a life.

447
00:54:23,426 --> 00:54:24,620
What?

448
00:54:29,065 --> 00:54:30,999
Saving a life is more important.

449
00:54:44,681 --> 00:54:47,946
Come on.

450
00:54:48,385 --> 00:54:49,909
Still not enough.

451
00:54:51,321 --> 00:54:53,414
I think you have some money.

452
00:54:53,523 --> 00:54:55,923
Hurry up! Take it out!

453
00:54:56,026 --> 00:54:58,221
Come on!

454
00:55:09,272 --> 00:55:12,070
You slept well after you took
the medicine last night.

455
00:55:12,175 --> 00:55:14,109
Are you feeling better?

456
00:55:16,179 --> 00:55:21,310
I'm a complete stranger to you,
yet you three...

457
00:55:21,418 --> 00:55:23,682
You're very welcome, Master Hong.

458
00:55:23,787 --> 00:55:25,186
Although we are nobody,

459
00:55:25,288 --> 00:55:27,085
but we know that you're a hero.

460
00:55:27,190 --> 00:55:29,750
That's why we'd like to help.

461
00:55:30,126 --> 00:55:34,495
You're indeed the real heroes.

462
00:55:55,285 --> 00:55:56,274
Come on.

463
00:56:20,677 --> 00:56:23,475
This is good medicine,
I guess you'd need to continue.

464
00:56:23,580 --> 00:56:27,607
Yes, at least ten times.

465
00:56:30,453 --> 00:56:31,715
What about the money for the medicine?

466
00:56:37,160 --> 00:56:39,253
Why don't you answer?

467
00:56:39,362 --> 00:56:41,853
I even used up the savings for my wedding.

468
00:56:41,965 --> 00:56:45,526
You're the one with all the ideas,
think of a plan!

469
00:56:48,171 --> 00:56:50,105
Alright, let us think!

470
00:56:53,943 --> 00:56:55,035
Steal!

471
00:56:56,946 --> 00:56:58,811
You're early today, Mei.

472
00:56:59,649 --> 00:57:02,516
Jin, two pieces of tofu.

473
00:57:03,553 --> 00:57:06,044
They're really fresh today.

474
00:57:09,225 --> 00:57:11,420
Yes, looks like it.

475
00:57:11,528 --> 00:57:13,621
Give me two pieces, Jin.

476
00:57:19,836 --> 00:57:20,803
Thanks.

477
00:57:21,504 --> 00:57:22,596
Let's go.

478
00:57:52,602 --> 00:57:56,094
Zhu Cai, what's the matter with you?

479
00:57:56,206 --> 00:57:58,174
Nothing.

480
00:57:58,274 --> 00:58:00,970
What can the poor do to get cash quick?

481
00:58:01,077 --> 00:58:06,606
Yes, there's one thing.

482
00:58:09,385 --> 00:58:10,545
It's called...

483
00:58:10,653 --> 00:58:13,315
Pawn things.

484
00:58:23,399 --> 00:58:25,458
The bill please.

485
00:58:30,573 --> 00:58:32,200
Twelve cents.

486
00:58:43,419 --> 00:58:44,545
Twelve cents.

487
00:58:47,490 --> 00:58:49,481
Did you enjoy the meal?

488
00:58:49,592 --> 00:58:52,322
It's alright, let's go.

489
00:58:58,968 --> 00:59:00,196
Think I'm too full.

490
00:59:00,303 --> 00:59:02,999
Good day.

491
00:59:06,376 --> 00:59:07,502
Take it. Thanks.

492
00:59:08,778 --> 00:59:12,214
Tofu? It's fresh today!

493
00:59:23,393 --> 00:59:25,623
The biggest piece, here you go.

494
00:59:26,629 --> 00:59:29,860
Mrs. Wang, it's been a while.
Want some tofu?

495
00:59:29,966 --> 00:59:30,796
Very fresh today.

496
00:59:30,900 --> 00:59:33,835
Please come back again.

497
00:59:39,842 --> 00:59:42,367
Jin, what are you doing?

498
00:59:42,478 --> 00:59:43,206
Nothing, it tickles.

499
00:59:43,313 --> 00:59:44,473
Tofu...

500
00:59:44,581 --> 00:59:45,809
A customer!

501
00:59:46,716 --> 00:59:49,207
Fresh tofu!

502
00:59:49,319 --> 00:59:51,150
The best quality!

503
00:59:51,754 --> 00:59:54,348
Here you go! Come back again! Thanks!

504
00:59:55,992 --> 00:59:58,756
Who would have thought?

505
00:59:58,861 --> 01:00:02,262
A dumb wit like you would steal from me!

506
01:00:07,003 --> 01:00:08,971
Count it! You've stolen so much from me!

507
01:00:09,072 --> 01:00:12,667
I'm running a business here.

508
01:00:12,775 --> 01:00:16,006
I've been treating you well.

509
01:00:16,112 --> 01:00:18,137
You bastard!

510
01:00:20,249 --> 01:00:23,514
You must pay ten times
of what you've stolen from me.

511
01:00:23,620 --> 01:00:25,315
Do you understand?

512
01:00:28,291 --> 01:00:29,258
"Pawn"

513
01:00:40,236 --> 01:00:42,227
Chen Ajin, how much do you have?

514
01:00:42,338 --> 01:00:43,896
I've got...

515
01:00:44,807 --> 01:00:46,570
You're looking for Jin?

516
01:00:46,876 --> 01:00:48,343
Do you know that he stole from me?

517
01:00:48,444 --> 01:00:50,537
And I caught him!

518
01:00:51,581 --> 01:00:54,414
You don't look like a decent person too.

519
01:00:54,517 --> 01:00:55,415
What are you here for?

520
01:00:55,518 --> 01:00:57,748
I...

521
01:00:57,854 --> 01:00:59,822
What are you doing here?

522
01:01:01,324 --> 01:01:02,848
I'm here to buy tofu.

523
01:01:02,959 --> 01:01:05,655
Buy tofu? How much?

524
01:01:05,762 --> 01:01:07,195
All of it.

525
01:01:10,333 --> 01:01:14,929
We've a big spender today!
I'll deal with you later.

526
01:01:16,739 --> 01:01:17,797
Come on.

527
01:01:18,841 --> 01:01:21,105
It won't be easy for you
to carry with all that tofu,

528
01:01:21,210 --> 01:01:23,940
I'll get my staff to help.

529
01:01:26,082 --> 01:01:29,108
Make the delivery and come back soon.

530
01:01:29,218 --> 01:01:32,187
I'll deduct from your pay
if you try to slack off.

531
01:01:37,493 --> 01:01:38,721
It's you!

532
01:01:39,062 --> 01:01:41,292
Do you know how expensive the vase is?

533
01:01:47,370 --> 01:01:50,168
What did you buy all that tofu for?

534
01:01:50,273 --> 01:01:54,175
You told me so. You didn't get any money.

535
01:01:54,277 --> 01:01:55,505
I pawned everything,

536
01:01:55,611 --> 01:01:57,943
and now I've all this tofu.

537
01:02:00,983 --> 01:02:02,712
What on earth are you two doing?

538
01:02:09,459 --> 01:02:11,586
Go get the medicine, hand me the tofu.

539
01:02:21,838 --> 01:02:24,898
Yang Dabao, where are you off to?

540
01:02:25,208 --> 01:02:27,438
What are you doing?

541
01:02:27,543 --> 01:02:29,238
Boss, we've got big business.

542
01:02:29,345 --> 01:02:31,142
We have guests who like tofu.

543
01:02:31,247 --> 01:02:32,908
Guests? Where?

544
01:02:37,487 --> 01:02:39,921
If they are,
bring these to the kitchen first.

545
01:02:40,022 --> 01:02:41,489
I'll take care of them.

546
01:02:43,826 --> 01:02:45,623
Please sit down.

547
01:02:49,699 --> 01:02:50,188
What's on the menu?

548
01:02:50,299 --> 01:02:51,231
Oh, tofu.

549
01:02:51,334 --> 01:02:52,892
How about some beef first?

550
01:02:55,138 --> 01:02:56,867
The beef, we kept it from last month.

551
01:02:56,973 --> 01:03:00,875
It's gone bad! Tofu is fresh.

552
01:03:00,977 --> 01:03:02,672
But we can't just eat tofu.

553
01:03:02,779 --> 01:03:05,213
Tofu is our specialty.

554
01:03:05,314 --> 01:03:07,214
We've fried, deep-fried, steamed,

555
01:03:07,316 --> 01:03:09,375
stewed, diced, chilled,

556
01:03:09,485 --> 01:03:11,953
with vegetables, with minced pork,

557
01:03:12,054 --> 01:03:15,581
in a soup... you name it, we have it.

558
01:03:15,992 --> 01:03:19,428
All of the above!

559
01:03:20,596 --> 01:03:22,962
Coming right up...

560
01:03:26,803 --> 01:03:27,963
At this time...

561
01:03:28,070 --> 01:03:30,561
No one would carry weapons so openly,

562
01:03:30,673 --> 01:03:32,538
must be some kind of officers.

563
01:03:36,245 --> 01:03:37,269
Thanks.

564
01:03:46,289 --> 01:03:46,778
Boss.

565
01:03:46,889 --> 01:03:48,550
Master Zeng.

566
01:03:48,658 --> 01:03:50,922
What did he buy just now?

567
01:03:51,027 --> 01:03:54,463
The best, he's been here a few times.

568
01:03:54,564 --> 01:03:55,792
I think someone is badly injured.

569
01:03:55,898 --> 01:03:59,595
Internal injuries.

570
01:04:04,006 --> 01:04:06,031
Can you remember the prescription?

571
01:04:11,647 --> 01:04:14,810
Master Zhou,
this is my friend Official Gao.

572
01:04:14,917 --> 01:04:17,408
He's on the Court's order
to catch Hong Xiguan.

573
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:19,954
Please assist him anyway you can.

574
01:04:20,056 --> 01:04:21,580
Certainly.

575
01:04:22,325 --> 01:04:25,123
We're trying to look for Hong Xiguan.

576
01:04:25,228 --> 01:04:28,720
According to my master White Brows,
Hong's injuries

577
01:04:28,831 --> 01:04:31,231
can only be healed by the Lama Clan.

578
01:04:32,168 --> 01:04:36,537
I wonder if Hong Xiguan came to you
for help.

579
01:04:38,174 --> 01:04:41,837
To be frank, he did.

580
01:04:43,880 --> 01:04:45,370
I'm a law-abiding citizen.

581
01:04:45,481 --> 01:04:47,711
A traitor like him came for help,

582
01:04:47,817 --> 01:04:50,547
I kicked him out right away.

583
01:04:50,653 --> 01:04:53,520
If Master Zhou captured him on the spot,

584
01:04:53,623 --> 01:04:56,649
you would have
helped the court a big deal.

585
01:04:56,759 --> 01:04:59,353
I think master Zhou didn't dare
to kill him.

586
01:04:59,462 --> 01:05:01,726
Hong Xiguan has a reputation.

587
01:05:08,604 --> 01:05:11,971
There's one prescription
to treat internal injuries.

588
01:05:12,074 --> 01:05:15,441
Bear's bladder powder,
rhino's horn powder...

589
01:05:15,544 --> 01:05:18,104
Yes, that's our special prescription.

590
01:05:18,214 --> 01:05:19,340
Zhu Cai bought this prescription
many times.

591
01:05:19,448 --> 01:05:23,248
Could it be...

592
01:05:24,654 --> 01:05:26,849
Right. He's cleaning the room

593
01:05:26,956 --> 01:05:28,583
when Hong Xiguan came here.

594
01:05:28,691 --> 01:05:30,283
Who's Zhu Cai?

595
01:05:30,660 --> 01:05:32,651
Don't worry, I can take care of him.

596
01:05:32,762 --> 01:05:34,730
He drops by everyday.

597
01:05:34,830 --> 01:05:39,631
Cheers! We've found the traitor!

598
01:05:59,855 --> 01:06:02,483
Let the "Qi" energy
travel through your body.

599
01:06:08,698 --> 01:06:10,996
You three excel in different areas.

600
01:06:11,100 --> 01:06:13,364
But no one has taught you about the Qi.

601
01:06:13,469 --> 01:06:16,267
That's why you might find it difficult

602
01:06:16,372 --> 01:06:19,034
for some complicated martial arts styles.

603
01:06:19,141 --> 01:06:21,302
With your foundation,

604
01:06:21,410 --> 01:06:23,401
it's easy for you to learn.

605
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:27,449
Let me teach you
Shaolin's own use of "Qi".

606
01:06:27,550 --> 01:06:29,780
Gather "Qi" at diaphragm.

607
01:07:00,449 --> 01:07:02,849
We're treating a VIP guest &
we don't have enough chefs

608
01:07:02,952 --> 01:07:06,217
It's a compliment that
we're using your chef.

609
01:07:06,322 --> 01:07:09,951
How can I run a restaurant without a chef?

610
01:07:10,059 --> 01:07:11,993
Do you have any idea who my guest is?

611
01:07:12,094 --> 01:07:14,119
Who cares whether or not
you can do business!

612
01:07:14,663 --> 01:07:16,187
Get the chef!

613
01:07:20,369 --> 01:07:25,306
Wait...

614
01:07:25,408 --> 01:07:26,773
We're just a small restaurant,

615
01:07:26,876 --> 01:07:29,071
our chef isn't that good.

616
01:07:29,178 --> 01:07:32,477
Yes, the dishes are only good for pigs.

617
01:07:34,283 --> 01:07:37,878
Well said.

618
01:07:41,590 --> 01:07:42,579
For your VIP guest,

619
01:07:42,691 --> 01:07:45,785
our chef is only useful
if you're serving a pig.

620
01:07:46,162 --> 01:07:47,424
What are you on about?

621
01:08:00,910 --> 01:08:05,506
Stop!

622
01:08:05,614 --> 01:08:07,138
Boss, we must.

623
01:08:07,249 --> 01:08:07,874
They've got the chef;

624
01:08:07,983 --> 01:08:09,610
without him, we've no business.

625
01:08:10,719 --> 01:08:12,550
Beat him!

626
01:08:17,526 --> 01:08:19,050
Beat him!

627
01:08:47,156 --> 01:08:48,487
Come on!

628
01:09:42,111 --> 01:09:43,874
Run!

629
01:09:49,018 --> 01:09:50,280
I can walk myself out.

630
01:09:50,386 --> 01:09:53,822
One, two, three.

631
01:09:58,494 --> 01:10:03,295
You broke everything!

632
01:10:03,399 --> 01:10:05,264
I'll deduct from your pay

633
01:10:08,537 --> 01:10:09,970
What are you doing?

634
01:10:11,807 --> 01:10:14,708
One, two, three.

635
01:10:17,346 --> 01:10:18,370
I'm Han Qi.

636
01:10:18,480 --> 01:10:19,913
I've seen you act.

637
01:10:20,015 --> 01:10:21,505
Brother Hong Xiguan is looking for you.

638
01:10:21,617 --> 01:10:22,948
I'm looking for him too.

639
01:10:23,452 --> 01:10:25,044
Come pick me up tonight,

640
01:10:25,154 --> 01:10:25,848
we'll go meet him.

641
01:10:25,955 --> 01:10:26,887
Sure.

642
01:10:29,358 --> 01:10:30,222
Master.

643
01:10:38,901 --> 01:10:41,461
Zhu Cai, the medicine you bought,

644
01:10:41,570 --> 01:10:43,197
who's that for?

645
01:10:43,305 --> 01:10:45,899
Speak up! Who's that for?

646
01:10:46,008 --> 01:10:49,068
For myself, it hurts here.

647
01:10:51,113 --> 01:10:55,015
Must be from the practising.
It's for myself.

648
01:10:56,452 --> 01:10:57,851
Hurts here?

649
01:10:57,953 --> 01:10:59,284
Yes.

650
01:11:00,155 --> 01:11:03,921
Interesting that you can
foresee your own injuries.

651
01:11:05,561 --> 01:11:07,825
Speak up! Who's that for?

652
01:11:07,930 --> 01:11:09,420
For myself.

653
01:11:14,370 --> 01:11:17,567
Where else does it hurt?

654
01:11:20,676 --> 01:11:26,239
Here... no... nowhere.

655
01:11:26,348 --> 01:11:27,940
What's the medicine for?

656
01:11:28,050 --> 01:11:30,245
Only Hong Xiguan would need
a prescription like that.

657
01:11:45,167 --> 01:11:48,330
Zhu Cai, if you show Official Gao
to Hong Xiguan,

658
01:11:48,437 --> 01:11:50,132
that's a merit.

659
01:11:51,940 --> 01:11:54,568
Speak up! Where is Hong Xiguan?

660
01:11:55,844 --> 01:11:59,211
He sneaks around in the tofu shop,

661
01:11:59,315 --> 01:12:01,749
I think Hong Xiguan could be there.

662
01:12:01,850 --> 01:12:04,842
No! He's not!

663
01:12:05,354 --> 01:12:08,221
Alright! You did us a favour.

664
01:12:18,901 --> 01:12:19,993
Who are you?

665
01:12:20,102 --> 01:12:22,002
Let me go! I'm the boss.

666
01:12:27,810 --> 01:12:28,936
Chen Ajin, run!

667
01:12:30,312 --> 01:12:31,244
Freeze.

668
01:13:08,951 --> 01:13:11,215
Where's Hong Xiguan? Speak up.

669
01:13:11,720 --> 01:13:13,017
At your grandma's.

670
01:13:30,572 --> 01:13:33,666
You! You can't do that

671
01:13:36,078 --> 01:13:37,511
This is more likely.

672
01:13:40,449 --> 01:13:42,007
Set a fire! And we can save them.

673
01:14:06,508 --> 01:14:08,237
They're below. We're setting a fire.

674
01:14:08,343 --> 01:14:09,605
Run!

675
01:14:17,953 --> 01:14:21,150
Don't panic! Run! Go!

676
01:14:27,296 --> 01:14:30,823
Run!

677
01:14:39,074 --> 01:14:40,268
Over there! Go!

678
01:14:40,375 --> 01:14:41,501
Go!

679
01:14:46,048 --> 01:14:47,106
Where to?

680
01:14:47,216 --> 01:14:49,184
The dye factory is right here,
let's hide inside.

681
01:14:49,284 --> 01:14:50,512
No, when they arrive,

682
01:14:50,619 --> 01:14:52,678
they would know that we're hiding there.

683
01:14:53,655 --> 01:14:56,089
We should hide in
Zhou Cheng's martial arts school.

684
01:14:56,191 --> 01:14:57,453
Good idea!

685
01:15:00,028 --> 01:15:02,622
Here you are!
Congratulations on catching Hong Xiguan,

686
01:15:02,731 --> 01:15:04,596
what an achievement!

687
01:15:06,034 --> 01:15:07,160
Well, I'm here.

688
01:15:07,269 --> 01:15:09,032
But no one caught me.

689
01:15:10,806 --> 01:15:13,366
You stay here. It's better for you.

690
01:15:18,780 --> 01:15:21,248
What a meal!

691
01:15:35,864 --> 01:15:37,058
Let's not ruin it.

692
01:15:37,165 --> 01:15:38,154
That's right.

693
01:16:20,442 --> 01:16:21,841
Zhu Cai works in the dye factory,

694
01:16:21,944 --> 01:16:23,673
he must be hiding in there.

695
01:16:27,916 --> 01:16:34,583
They're in the school, the master...

696
01:16:39,227 --> 01:16:42,492
Careful. After you!

697
01:16:42,598 --> 01:16:43,587
Me?

698
01:16:43,699 --> 01:16:44,859
Go!

699
01:17:18,500 --> 01:17:19,865
They're gone.

700
01:17:21,236 --> 01:17:23,830
Hey! Come on in! No one's here.

701
01:17:25,040 --> 01:17:27,531
I'll take a look first, follow me.

702
01:17:33,615 --> 01:17:36,243
How come he's suddenly acting so brave?

703
01:17:36,952 --> 01:17:40,410
They're gone, of course he would.

704
01:17:41,223 --> 01:17:42,850
It's clear.

705
01:17:55,270 --> 01:17:57,966
Next door is the dye factory,
wonder if they're there.

706
01:18:07,649 --> 01:18:10,550
No lights. Guess they must have fled.

707
01:18:10,652 --> 01:18:13,450
Official Gao, I'm being brave,

708
01:18:13,555 --> 01:18:15,352
I deserve a credit.

709
01:18:18,727 --> 01:18:20,661
Sure, you do.

710
01:18:25,033 --> 01:18:26,432
They're over there at the wall.

711
01:18:26,535 --> 01:18:29,003
They're in the dark.

712
01:18:29,104 --> 01:18:32,335
Unfamiliarity with the settings
is to our disadvantage.

713
01:18:32,441 --> 01:18:35,467
Zeng Shiguang is an example.

714
01:18:35,577 --> 01:18:36,805
Go to the magistrate's office
and get some manpower.

715
01:18:36,912 --> 01:18:38,106
Block all the exits.

716
01:18:38,213 --> 01:18:39,646
Yes.

717
01:18:42,617 --> 01:18:44,676
We indeed need the manpower.

718
01:18:44,786 --> 01:18:48,779
But it's late in the night,
I'd rather not alert them.

719
01:18:48,890 --> 01:18:50,949
And besides,
we haven't contacted the magistrate,

720
01:18:51,059 --> 01:18:54,495
I worry that we can't get any help
until daybreak.

721
01:18:54,596 --> 01:18:56,587
All we can do is bluff for now,

722
01:18:56,698 --> 01:18:59,223
we'll get the men in the morning.

723
01:19:05,474 --> 01:19:07,408
Why don't they attack?

724
01:19:07,776 --> 01:19:08,538
There's no light.

725
01:19:08,643 --> 01:19:11,703
They wouldn't dare to attack in the dark.

726
01:19:12,114 --> 01:19:14,275
The archers on the left,
shoot when you spot anyone.

727
01:19:14,382 --> 01:19:16,942
Soldiers with axes on the right,
chop if you see anyone

728
01:19:18,920 --> 01:19:21,320
We'll keep disturbing them over the night.

729
01:19:21,423 --> 01:19:24,449
That way, they can't sleep
and dare not escape.

730
01:19:24,559 --> 01:19:26,049
We'll launch a proper attack tomorrow.

731
01:19:52,487 --> 01:19:54,045
I think it's just a bluff,

732
01:19:54,156 --> 01:19:56,090
but we need to be prepared.

733
01:20:14,910 --> 01:20:17,344
The power of the palm is
different between yin & yang.

734
01:20:17,445 --> 01:20:20,881
After controlling your "Qi" right,
you can master it.

735
01:20:20,982 --> 01:20:22,745
Ah Jin, you try.

736
01:20:29,457 --> 01:20:32,017
You're not focused enough... once again.

737
01:20:50,178 --> 01:20:52,009
That's better.

738
01:21:10,932 --> 01:21:12,024
Not bad.

739
01:21:16,371 --> 01:21:18,669
Listen up, traitors!
You've been surrounded.

740
01:21:18,773 --> 01:21:21,333
This is where you'll die.

741
01:21:22,744 --> 01:21:24,974
Ah Jin, no!

742
01:21:37,993 --> 01:21:40,018
I brought Zhou Cheng's feast here.

743
01:21:40,128 --> 01:21:41,857
Let's have a good meal!

744
01:21:41,963 --> 01:21:43,931
That's right. If someone comes close,

745
01:21:44,032 --> 01:21:45,932
we can hear.

746
01:21:46,268 --> 01:21:48,566
I'll move all the weapons here.

747
01:21:49,004 --> 01:21:51,598
I think we should hide them first.

748
01:22:01,116 --> 01:22:02,674
Come on.

749
01:22:07,122 --> 01:22:09,647
Let's not congratulate ourselves
for escaping earlier;

750
01:22:09,758 --> 01:22:12,022
It's only because
Gao Jinzhong's gang underestimated us

751
01:22:12,127 --> 01:22:14,527
Those five are very skilled,

752
01:22:14,629 --> 01:22:17,189
and they're backed by the court.

753
01:22:17,299 --> 01:22:20,291
You had nothing to do with it,

754
01:22:20,402 --> 01:22:23,667
I appreciate that you helped me
with my medicine.

755
01:22:23,772 --> 01:22:26,935
I wouldn't blame you
for wanting to leave now.

756
01:22:27,876 --> 01:22:31,334
I'm their target.

757
01:22:34,149 --> 01:22:37,209
Hong Xiguan, you despise us.

758
01:22:41,723 --> 01:22:44,089
If I meant anything like that,

759
01:22:44,192 --> 01:22:45,887
please let me be struck by thunder.

760
01:22:49,664 --> 01:22:52,895
I was wrong, please forgive me.

761
01:22:53,001 --> 01:22:56,528
Come on, sit.

762
01:23:03,278 --> 01:23:05,269
I'm honoured to have friends like you.

763
01:23:05,380 --> 01:23:07,507
This is certainly
something to celebrate for.

764
01:23:08,183 --> 01:23:09,650
It's a long night.

765
01:23:09,751 --> 01:23:13,118
Let's drink and talk about martial arts.

766
01:23:13,221 --> 01:23:14,245
Come!

767
01:23:16,124 --> 01:23:17,523
Brother Hong, please teach us.

768
01:23:19,594 --> 01:23:23,428
Earlier on, Priest White Brows
learnt from Wudang Clan;

769
01:23:23,531 --> 01:23:25,726
Gao Jinzhong remains his best student.

770
01:23:25,834 --> 01:23:29,099
I hear they're hoping to build up
a White Brows Clan.

771
01:23:29,204 --> 01:23:32,469
We must watch out for Gao Jinzhong first,

772
01:23:32,574 --> 01:23:34,405
especially his braid.

773
01:23:35,810 --> 01:23:37,937
Know your enemy!

774
01:23:38,046 --> 01:23:41,573
Zou Feng's sword strikes fast and sneaky.

775
01:23:43,251 --> 01:23:46,379
He has a shield to protect himself.

776
01:23:46,488 --> 01:23:48,888
Watch out for his sword
breaking through the shield,

777
01:23:48,990 --> 01:23:50,355
that's his trick.

778
01:23:54,763 --> 01:23:56,526
Fan Tiancong is a man with
massive strength.

779
01:23:56,631 --> 01:23:59,429
I think he's the one hitting the wall now.

780
01:24:02,504 --> 01:24:05,029
Each strike is deadly,

781
01:24:05,140 --> 01:24:07,370
we must think of a way to deal with him.

782
01:24:13,314 --> 01:24:15,874
So boring! Let's check them!

783
01:24:15,984 --> 01:24:16,450
Sure.

784
01:24:16,551 --> 01:24:17,950
You cover for me.

785
01:24:34,969 --> 01:24:35,993
Go!

786
01:24:42,277 --> 01:24:45,508
They are the Tiger Kid and Leopard Kid.

787
01:24:45,613 --> 01:24:48,810
Tiger Kid has a deadly kick.

788
01:24:51,986 --> 01:24:55,046
Leopard Kid kills with the copper ring.

789
01:24:55,957 --> 01:24:59,552
Don't think that they're just kids,

790
01:24:59,661 --> 01:25:01,993
they're very vicious. You must be careful.

791
01:25:16,711 --> 01:25:19,612
The soldiers are gathering,
they'll be here soon.

792
01:28:09,884 --> 01:28:12,580
Wait. Come on.

793
01:29:45,346 --> 01:29:46,335
Come on.

794
01:30:01,295 --> 01:30:02,523
Have a drink.

795
01:30:10,872 --> 01:30:12,897
What style is this?

796
01:30:13,007 --> 01:30:15,237
The Black Tiger Clan's style.

797
01:32:07,588 --> 01:32:08,816
Zhu Cai...

798
01:32:10,958 --> 01:32:12,892
Zhu Cai...

799
01:39:20,354 --> 01:39:22,720
Dabao...

800
01:40:23,484 --> 01:40:25,076
Brother Hong, the soldiers are here!

801
01:40:25,185 --> 01:40:27,710
Leave with Han Qi, I'll stay behind.

802
01:40:28,756 --> 01:40:29,381
No!

803
01:40:29,490 --> 01:40:31,549
I'm injured anyway.

804
01:40:31,892 --> 01:40:34,326
Leave now! Or you won't make it!

805
01:40:34,428 --> 01:40:35,725
We'll stay behind and block them.

806
01:40:35,829 --> 01:40:37,228
Jin's badly injured too.

807
01:40:37,331 --> 01:40:40,892
If we all die,
who's going to complete the mission?

808
01:40:41,001 --> 01:40:42,093
Run!

809
01:40:42,936 --> 01:40:43,868
Run!

810
01:40:54,982 --> 01:40:56,074
Shoot!

811
01:41:03,891 --> 01:41:08,225
Dabao, we lived life to the fullest.

812
01:41:09,563 --> 01:41:11,155
Fun, isn't it?
