Look. their noses are exactly like yours.

00:01:26,576 --> 00:01:29,910
Yea, everybody from my family has a big nose,

5
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:32,523
It's be even better if they're fraternal twins,

6
00:01:32,596 --> 00:01:35,028
If our daughter has a nose like yours

7
00:01:35,067 --> 00:01:36,834
who wants her?

8
00:01:37,189 --> 00:01:39,550
Isn't it great with two dragons now?

9
00:01:39,695 --> 00:01:42,268
Give me the two dragons then,

10
00:01:45,159 --> 00:01:45,918

Call the headquarter, tell them I've got Crazy K,eung

13
00:01:52,675 --> 00:01:54,134
They look exactly the same

14
00:01:54,241 --> 00:01:55,735
Its difficult to separate them

15
00:01:55,841 --> 00:01:57,644
K,nock on wood and reword yourself!

16
00:01:57,686 --> 00:02:00,782
Don't talk about splitting them apart,

17
00:02:08,056 --> 00:02:10,417
The convict escaped!

18
00:02:11,779 --> 00:02:15,528
Be good. my son 

19
00:02:15,712 --> 00:02:16,613
Who are you?

20
00:02:16,826 --> 00:02:18,320
Who is it? Why are you here?

21
00:02:18,426 --> 00:02:20,679
Return my son to me 

22
00:02:22,185 --> 00:02:23,608
How dare you lay a hand on me?

23
00:02:23,751 --> 00:02:26,491
Please don't... K,eung, The child is innocent

24
00:02:26,918 --> 00:02:27,985
Don't do anything rash

25
00:02:29,006 --> 00:02:30,394
Open fire!

26
00:02:32,659 --> 00:02:34,735
Give me back my son!

27
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:37,773
How dare you fight over something with me? Get lost

28
00:02:47,693 --> 00:02:49,531
Go away!

29
00:02:59,003 --> 00:03:00,283
You bastard!

30
00:03:22,318 --> 00:03:26,067
Freeze. How could that impact not kill you?

31
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:29,926
You animal! You wouldn't even leave mercy on a child?!

32
00:03:30,426 --> 00:03:33,973
Cordate Telosma

33
00:03:34,846 --> 00:03:39,497
I will sing for you 

34
00:03:39,544 --> 00:03:43,293
Hey. boss! You still haven't gone home when it's so late at night.

35
00:03:43,407 --> 00:03:45,625
Are you looking for someone to drink with you?

36
00:03:45,738 --> 00:03:49,321
You don't drink, I drink!

37
00:03:50,262 --> 00:03:53,144
The infant is missing, Only a wheelchair remains,

38
00:03:53,534 --> 00:03:55,645
Keep searching! - Got it.

39
00:03:56,421 --> 00:04:00,062
You can't even protect a baby.

40
00:04:00,249 --> 00:04:02,716
What kind of policemen are you?

41
00:04:08,079 --> 00:04:10,676
They're crying in such sorrow

42
00:04:11,316 --> 00:04:12,976
They're crying in such sorrow

43
00:04:13,091 --> 00:04:14,620
Will they be in America for good?

44
00:04:14,969 --> 00:04:16,950
Pass them a handkerchief!

45
00:04:19,319 --> 00:04:21,264
Thanks!

46
00:04:34,666 --> 00:04:37,335
Yuen Ting, when did you had a baby with Yiu?

47
00:04:37,381 --> 00:04:40,607
Let me hold him, Who'd have a baby with him. I found him in the streets

48
00:04:42,008 --> 00:04:43,597
He's so cute

49
00:04:49,177 --> 00:04:51,644
Hey. kid! Fork over your protection fee

50
00:04:52,866 --> 00:04:53,802
Take this. idiot!

51
00:04:53,875 --> 00:04:55,856
Stay there. you little bastard

52
00:05:59,959 --> 00:06:02,284
How did this happen?

53
00:06:12,347 --> 00:06:13,806
Hey!

54
00:06:13,948 --> 00:06:15,572
Hi!

55
00:06:15,723 --> 00:06:16,826
He was molesting me!

56
00:06:16,942 --> 00:06:18,495
What? Who dare to do that!

57
00:06:18,611 --> 00:06:19,405
Stay there!

58
00:06:19,447 --> 00:06:20,727
He just suddenly wanted to beat me up. Die-Hard.

59
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:21,942
Fight back!

60
00:06:22,056 --> 00:06:22,886
Sure!

61
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:27,439
C'mon.

62
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:28,492
Come and hit me!

63
00:06:34,654 --> 00:06:36,006
Finish it and leave

64
00:06:36,116 --> 00:06:36,839
There they are!

65
00:06:36,986 --> 00:06:38,160
Beat him up!

66
00:06:39,769 --> 00:06:40,943
Go to hell!

67
00:06:41,057 --> 00:06:42,931
Don't hurt the innocent.

68
00:06:59,431 --> 00:07:02,693

A pretty girl!

71
00:07:34,091 --> 00:07:36,594
Love remains in our dreams

72
00:07:37,989 --> 00:07:41,014
Heart-to-heart with no regrets

73
00:07:42,895 --> 00:07:47,023
Each day, we meet and share our lives together

74
00:07:47,628 --> 00:07:51,697
Our hearts come close for eternity

75
00:07:52,082 --> 00:07:59,972
Nothing to consider regardless of the situation

76
00:08:00,086 --> 00:08:01,295
Nice 

77
00:08:01,757 --> 00:08:03,560
Nice sale for the night.

78
00:08:03,601 --> 00:08:04,846
Cheers - Cheers

79
00:08:04,958 --> 00:08:06,061
Is this good to drink?

80
00:08:06,107 --> 00:08:08,680
-Split it amongst the brothers -Split it amongst the brothers

81
00:08:10,908 --> 00:08:13,233
Brother Wai, let's take a look at the photos!

82
00:08:14,354 --> 00:08:17,688
Brother Wing. your driving technique is much better than Speedy K,uen's

83
00:08:17,799 --> 00:08:21,025
From now on. with your reputation in Princess Margaret Road and the Eastern Corridor

84
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:24,366
they can't even be considered racing

85
00:08:24,516 --> 00:08:27,185
no matter how hard they step on the pedal without your seal of approval

86
00:08:27,334 --> 00:08:29,137
Alright let's give a toast to Brother Wing

87
00:08:30,048 --> 00:08:34,082
Cheers

88
00:08:38,923 --> 00:08:40,726
Die-Hard. over here!

89
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:45,491
What's wrong with you? Why are you all dressed up?

90
00:08:45,674 --> 00:08:47,477
We're going to make it big

91
00:08:47,553 --> 00:08:49,356
Of course, it'd have to look cool

92
00:08:50,998 --> 00:08:52,278
Where's the weapon?

93
00:08:52,425 --> 00:08:54,477
Brought 'em right here!

94
00:08:54,651 --> 00:08:56,940
I still don't understand why you have insist on dressing up?

95
00:08:58,793 --> 00:09:00,417
Negotiation!

96
00:09:00,811 --> 00:09:03,243
Iron Wing was trying to seduce my girlfriend!

97
00:09:03,351 --> 00:09:05,047
You have a girlfriend? I didn't know that

98
00:09:05,195 --> 00:09:08,457
Did I ever need to tell you about it? Am I required to write a report as well?

99
00:09:10,346 --> 00:09:12,599
She's gorgeous

100
00:09:15,044 --> 00:09:16,633
This Filipino maid is your girlfriend?

101
00:09:16,679 --> 00:09:19,004
What bad taste! Doesn't she look like Maradonna?

102
00:09:19,115 --> 00:09:20,324
Maradonna's a soccer player

103
00:09:20,438 --> 00:09:22,062
If you're coming to open negotiations. please go ahead!

104
00:09:22,177 --> 00:09:24,395
You still tak e me as your boss after all.

105
00:09:25,379 --> 00:09:29,020
Brother Wing. Iet's sing a duet! C'mon...

106
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:30,527
Alright 

107
00:09:30,634 --> 00:09:32,294
Don't be shy. Brother Wing

108
00:09:32,409 --> 00:09:34,283
Bring her up to a room and get it done,

109
00:09:34,322 --> 00:09:35,294
Forget about the mood and the atmosphere

110
00:09:35,366 --> 00:09:37,311
This room has been book ed for 3 days already

111
00:09:40,239 --> 00:09:42,006
Sorry Sir

112
00:09:42,153 --> 00:09:43,647
It's a full house tonight

113
00:09:46,224 --> 00:09:48,300
Sing!

114
00:09:48,938 --> 00:09:55,154
Can destiny give results to love?

115
00:09:57,394 --> 00:10:05,082
Can an oath guarantee that love is real

116
00:10:07,104 --> 00:10:12,669
Spending time apart doesn't mean it's either good or bad

117
00:10:14,064 --> 00:10:17,742
The song hasn't even finished! Get back  to where you are.

118
00:10:17,822 --> 00:10:19,281
Die-Hard.

No other way. okay?

120
00:10:21,197 --> 00:10:24,115
We're here to negotiate, We won't need any tables, ok ay?

121
00:10:24,225 --> 00:10:25,754
Why are you standing there lik e an idiot?

122
00:10:25,826 --> 00:10:27,664
Go back  up to sing! -No more singing,

123
00:10:28,784 --> 00:10:30,408
Who said so?

124
00:10:30,454 --> 00:10:32,043
I did,

125
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,784
And just who do you think  you are?

126
00:10:33,899 --> 00:10:37,862
I'm Tarzan. He's my bodyguard, Die-Hard

127
00:10:37,971 --> 00:10:40,224
I've never heard of your name,

128
00:10:40,267 --> 00:10:41,820
Who are you to talk to me?

129
00:10:42,704 --> 00:10:45,373
Are you guys scared of being outnumbered?

130
00:10:45,487 --> 00:10:47,634
Not that many!

131
00:10:51,368 --> 00:10:53,277
Go get the microphone! - Yes!

132
00:10:53,386 --> 00:10:54,145
You tak e the microphone!

133
00:10:54,187 --> 00:10:55,539
I can't sing.

134
00:11:00,312 --> 00:11:02,909
I'm here to flirt with you no  I'm here to save you

135
00:11:02,956 --> 00:11:05,245
Save me? You or him?

136
00:11:07,794 --> 00:11:09,347
Take the speakers away,

137
00:11:23,106 --> 00:11:24,565
Die-Hard

138
00:11:27,038 --> 00:11:28,567
How to fight with the microphone?

139
00:11:40,018 --> 00:11:41,571
How dare you lay a finger on my girl?

140
00:11:44,473 --> 00:11:47,391
Boss...Die-Hard. come and save me!

141
00:11:48,022 --> 00:11:49,896
Damn you!

142
00:12:06,743 --> 00:12:08,367
Why haven't you draw your weapons?

143
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:09,898
Freeze!

144
00:12:12,764 --> 00:12:14,816
Don't move!

145
00:12:15,339 --> 00:12:16,762
Are you alright?

146
00:12:17,844 --> 00:12:21,284
I paid $800 to rent this suit, what do you think?

147
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,798
Don't move! Don't move...

148
00:12:24,874 --> 00:12:26,403
Don't move!

149
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:29,114
Don't move!

150
00:12:29,677 --> 00:12:31,409
Don't move! Don't move...

151
00:12:31,521 --> 00:12:33,324
My hand hurts!

152
00:12:33,435 --> 00:12:34,751
I went a little overboard

153
00:12:35,175 --> 00:12:36,835
Are you alright? Don't be afraid.

154
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,504
Are you Die-Hard? - Yes!

155
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:40,697
I can knock down 5 people with my bare-hands

156
00:12:40,743 --> 00:12:42,581
My bullets can hit another...

157
00:12:43,214 --> 00:12:45,290
Whatever....but anyway, it's alot

158
00:12:45,336 --> 00:12:47,412
Come forward if you are willing to sacrifice for your boss

159
00:12:47,494 --> 00:12:49,226
Come forward!

160
00:12:49,338 --> 00:12:52,849
Go away! - We're leaving, boss,

161
00:12:54,488 --> 00:12:57,085
Leaving?! Who's going to compensate for my loss?

162
00:12:57,133 --> 00:12:58,556
I'm not letting go that easily

163
00:12:58,664 --> 00:13:00,609
Pass me your gun. Let me show off a bit with it

164
00:13:00,683 --> 00:13:02,142
We've had enough of that

165
00:13:03,432 --> 00:13:05,543
You did. not me

166
00:13:05,659 --> 00:13:06,868
This gun is too light

167
00:13:07,156 --> 00:13:08,579
Stop nagging!

168
00:13:08,687 --> 00:13:11,878

It cost me a few dollars, what do you expect,

172

It's cool now.

180
00:14:10,734 --> 00:14:12,193

What now? You can't beat me. What a shame!

183
00:14:21,974 --> 00:14:24,227
How can you maintain a good name?

184
00:14:24,410 --> 00:14:25,204
Get up!

185
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:27,297

Die-Hard. I'm coming to save you!

188
00:14:45,290 --> 00:14:47,472
Why's it always like this?

189
00:14:48,526 --> 00:14:51,860
Great! Great!

190
00:15:03,107 --> 00:15:05,503
Who are you to compete with me? Look at yourself

191
00:15:05,717 --> 00:15:07,176
Twice as shorter than me

192
00:15:07,283 --> 00:15:10,094
You're not any better, baldy!

193

You're Ah Wai

195
00:15:17,409 --> 00:15:19,212
In our profession, we only beat the big one

196
00:15:19,254 --> 00:15:22,244
You wanna embarasse yourself again?

197
00:15:23,256 --> 00:15:24,715
Can't be as worse as you

198
00:15:29,345 --> 00:15:32,050
Hold on! Hit the left leg, will ya?

199
00:15:32,129 --> 00:15:34,490
Leave me the right leg to control the gas when the car is racing

200
00:15:34,565 --> 00:15:35,881
What did you say? A car race

201
00:15:35,992 --> 00:15:37,581
Lik e you wanna compete with me?

202

00:15:40,168 --> 00:15:41,721
You know what happened to Speedy Kuen?

204
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:43,820
His broke his ribs last time in the last race

205
00:15:45,005 --> 00:15:46,950
Speedy K,uen is nothing!

206
00:15:47,127 --> 00:15:50,496
His car headlights can't even spot our pumps on Princess Margaret Road

207
00:15:50,608 --> 00:15:52,304
Any drivers can beat him,

208
00:15:52,383 --> 00:15:53,912
Who do you think you are?

209
00:15:53,984 --> 00:15:57,080
I am k nown for my driving sk ill in Macau racetrack s

210
00:15:57,184 --> 00:15:58,773
Princess Margaret Road is nothing to me

211
00:15:58,855 --> 00:16:01,975
Fine, I'll race you in Macau

212
00:16:02,057 --> 00:16:03,195

216
00:16:09,817 --> 00:16:12,664
Sure! 300.000 is nothing to me

217
00:16:12,810 --> 00:16:14,304

222
00:16:31,010 --> 00:16:33,299
What are you to race with him? You can't even start your engine

223
00:16:39,292 --> 00:16:40,786
Do you guys remember me?

224
00:16:41,693 --> 00:16:44,611
Hop, ma'am! - Jump in!

225
00:16:44,652 --> 00:16:45,968
Thanks,

226

Thanks so much for that.

227
00:16:51,471 --> 00:16:53,309
I've been work ing at the karaoke for the past few days

228
00:16:53,455 --> 00:16:55,566
Iron Wing is always coming to watch my performance

229
00:16:55,647 --> 00:16:56,927
If you weren't there

230
00:16:56,970 --> 00:16:58,594
he would have harassed me to sleep with him

231
00:16:58,815 --> 00:17:01,104
It's alright, It was my pleasure

232
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:02,602
Is your name really Die-Hard?

233
00:17:02,677 --> 00:17:04,065
Yes

234
00:17:04,209 --> 00:17:05,738
This is such a weird name, What about you?

235
00:17:05,809 --> 00:17:07,338

Didn't you say she's your girl?

239
00:17:16,144 --> 00:17:18,682
Sooner or later, she'll be my girl

240
00:17:18,789 --> 00:17:22,680

00:17:33,022 --> 00:17:34,125
I'm about to get her,

244
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:37,016
I can risk my life for you You should know what you've got.

245
00:17:37,059 --> 00:17:39,135
Do you think there's a possibility that Maradonna would ever like you?

246
00:17:39,321 --> 00:17:40,709
Look at the color of her hair, will ya?

247
00:17:40,748 --> 00:17:42,966
She's make you a cuck olded.

254
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:13,456
Miss Barbara, please tell our hero

255
00:18:13,599 --> 00:18:17,834
Would you ever fall for him?

256
00:18:20,628 --> 00:18:22,989

257
00:18:27,483 --> 00:18:28,906

How can I raise $300,000?

266
00:19:23,267 --> 00:19:25,592
Where's my money, Chan?

267
00:19:25,737 --> 00:19:28,026
Didn't you use my car to race last time?

268
00:19:28,104 --> 00:19:29,135
How much will you pay for that?

269
00:19:29,182 --> 00:19:31,755
Dude, you bet on that too!

270
00:19:31,862 --> 00:19:33,321
You won and you took your share of the bonus

271
00:19:33,706 --> 00:19:36,138
That was my boss' car, The engines all fell apart

272
00:19:36,247 --> 00:19:38,358
That couldn't ever cover the repairing cost

273
00:19:38,439 --> 00:19:39,684
What are you trying to say?

274
00:19:39,762 --> 00:19:41,529
This car just had a respray

275

My boss didn't know Susan at the time when I got romantic with her

279
00:19:51,558 --> 00:19:55,141
Is that so? But there's no date indicated in this photo

280
00:20:00,814 --> 00:20:03,969
Tarzan! Print another few copies, it's on him,

00:20:12,995 --> 00:20:14,869

290
00:20:27,297 --> 00:20:29,586
So you think  you're better with a bigger car, eh?

291

00:21:00,113 --> 00:21:03,233
Tarzen. Why are you squatting there?

Is this a mirror?

307
00:21:29,935 --> 00:21:32,082
It's not 200,000. it's 400.000 shares

308
00:21:32,198 --> 00:21:33,894
Yau Ma

309
00:21:34,007 --> 00:21:35,395
Do you still recognize your uncle?

310
00:21:35,504 --> 00:21:36,535

She used to play the flutes with you

315
00:21:47,614 --> 00:21:49,346
Come and give a greeting, daughter dear.

316
00:21:51,059 --> 00:21:52,933
This is how encounters are supposed to be

317
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,989
She's a nurse

318
00:21:56,313 --> 00:21:59,053
She knew you were back  so she quit her job to take good care of you

319

You can easily catch endemic

322

You're an internationally famous conductor

323
00:22:07,171 --> 00:22:08,072
If you get sick

324
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:10,161
you can't do anything. and 

325
00:22:10,199 --> 00:22:13,497
Uncle. I'll go get a change of clothes, Alright, we'll do more catch up later

326
00:22:15,976 --> 00:22:18,052
Pull that lower

327
00:22:18,098 --> 00:22:19,794
I have a boyfriend

328
00:22:19,873 --> 00:22:22,863
I'm finding you a husband, not a boyfriend

329
00:22:22,901 --> 00:22:23,766
What about R ocky?

330
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:24,812
Stallone?

331
00:22:24,849 --> 00:22:26,758
No, Frankie Lok

332
00:22:26,798 --> 00:22:28,078
I call him R ocky

333
00:22:28,190 --> 00:22:30,479
Rock y tells people to work  hard too

334
00:22:30,522 --> 00:22:32,360
Hold this first aid kit

335
00:22:32,401 --> 00:22:34,346
Your dad is even more powerful than R ocky

336
00:22:34,385 --> 00:22:35,773
I'm handling seven at a time in the mark et

337
00:22:35,812 --> 00:22:37,757
I hope it work s out between you and him

338
00:22:37,794 --> 00:22:40,367
Then our business with the Ma's family would be fine

339
00:22:40,475 --> 00:22:42,313
This is struggling to succeed

340
00:22:42,388 --> 00:22:44,191
The mark et's quiet bad nowadays

341
00:22:44,893 --> 00:22:47,526
Yau Ma, My daughter is look ing for you

342
00:22:47,608 --> 00:22:51,286
Remember to "feel by touch". now get in there

343
00:22:54,881 --> 00:22:56,790
It's all up to you, daughter dear

344
00:23:00,484 --> 00:23:02,358
Alright, just leave them there

345
00:23:02,467 --> 00:23:03,961
Sigh. there's a lot of medicine

346
00:23:04,033 --> 00:23:05,171
I thought Uncle was just jok ing

347
00:23:05,216 --> 00:23:07,363
So nurses dress this sexy nowadays?

348
00:23:07,478 --> 00:23:08,509
You're exposing everything

349
00:23:08,871 --> 00:23:10,187
The top part

350
00:23:11,654 --> 00:23:15,545
Actually, I never tak e any medicinal products and vitamin pills since I was at a very young age

351
00:23:15,621 --> 00:23:18,088
If I k new it earlier, I wouldn't bring so many over

352
00:23:18,301 --> 00:23:19,510
Come, have a seat,

353
00:23:24,217 --> 00:23:27,551
Wearing a sk irt so tight is gonna affect your blood circulation

354
00:23:27,628 --> 00:23:29,016
Wrong posture is problematic too

355
00:23:29,542 --> 00:23:32,911
Your spine must be hurting right now

356
00:23:33,056 --> 00:23:34,716
How do you k now?

357
00:23:34,761 --> 00:23:36,385
Come, get into bed

358
00:23:36,467 --> 00:23:37,498
Already?!

359
00:23:41,025 --> 00:23:44,145
Don't be nervoue, tak e it slow. Take it easy.

360
00:23:44,262 --> 00:23:46,029
I'm all yours -your hand

361
00:23:46,071 --> 00:23:47,316
Do whatever you want,

362
00:23:50,595 --> 00:23:52,647
Here. raise your leg

363
00:23:52,752 --> 00:23:53,890
Relax

364
00:23:55,641 --> 00:23:56,957
It's almost done?

365
00:23:57,068 --> 00:23:58,835
Isn't it easier with my clothes off?

366
00:23:58,982 --> 00:24:01,034
Patience!

367
00:24:04,863 --> 00:24:06,666
Isn't this what you would call "foreplay"?

368
00:24:06,742 --> 00:24:08,960
I'm doing some warm up for you

369
00:24:10,187 --> 00:24:13,069
To help your blood circulation

370
00:24:13,563 --> 00:24:15,639
Are you ready?

371
00:24:15,755 --> 00:24:21,735
relax... is it getting comfortable yet?

372
00:24:22,262 --> 00:24:26,746
Hey... fell asleep already?

373
00:24:26,856 --> 00:24:30,047
It must be tiring for you to twist this hard

374
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:34,579
I grew up and learnt here

375
00:24:34,685 --> 00:24:36,238
Never thought of leaving this place

376
00:24:36,286 --> 00:24:38,611
I've never heard people wanting to sneak  back  to the mainland

377
00:24:38,723 --> 00:24:40,276
That's what mak es us cool

378
00:24:40,392 --> 00:24:43,512
We're the first ones. aren't we?

379
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:46,656
We may get listed in Guinness Book  of World R ecords

380
00:24:46,726 --> 00:24:48,114
Is there any cash prize?

381
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:51,036
I'd have to split everything with you. Hold onto this

382
00:24:51,111 --> 00:24:54,207
Me again? What about you?

383
00:24:54,312 --> 00:24:55,972
I'm calling Barbara

384
00:24:56,088 --> 00:24:58,235
Did she give you her number?

385
00:24:58,419 --> 00:25:02,453
I can check the white page, stupid!

386
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:03,948
Damn you

387
00:25:04,265 --> 00:25:06,174
I'd have to give you a lot of credit here

388
00:25:08,163 --> 00:25:09,135
You wok e up

389
00:25:09,241 --> 00:25:10,735
It was so comfortable last night,

390
00:25:10,808 --> 00:25:12,231
Can I get you any drinks, missy?

391
00:25:15,575 --> 00:25:17,520
Well. aren't you a little late, boss?

392
00:25:17,558 --> 00:25:18,946
Don't bother me, You go talk  to him

393
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:19,814
What's up with him?

394
00:25:19,889 --> 00:25:21,205
I don't wanna talk  about it. ask  him

395
00:25:21,316 --> 00:25:22,704
Where's the money?

396
00:25:22,813 --> 00:25:24,093
Tarzen. it's time to pay up!

397
00:25:24,135 --> 00:25:25,071
You pay

398
00:25:25,179 --> 00:25:26,246
The money's with you

399
00:25:26,327 --> 00:25:27,299
Right,

400
00:25:29,077 --> 00:25:30,393
Mak e it cheaper, yea?

401
00:25:30,539 --> 00:25:31,819
Just pay him,

402
00:25:32,696 --> 00:25:33,632
You stole this boat

403
00:25:33,671 --> 00:25:35,224
And it costed you nothing. You're making a fortune here!

404
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:37,104
Call me when you get to Shantou

405
00:25:37,603 --> 00:25:39,227
Hey. what's Barbara's last name?

406
00:25:39,308 --> 00:25:40,861
Barbara? Of course it's Bar.

407
00:25:40,909 --> 00:25:42,712
Snaky Sun. do we have enough gas for the boat?

408
00:25:42,823 --> 00:25:44,068
Yes!

409
00:25:50,479 --> 00:25:53,184
Something's wrong, Snak y Sun betrayed us

410
00:25:53,297 --> 00:25:54,233
No boat?

411
00:25:54,376 --> 00:25:55,764
No, but a lot of people came to send us off,

412
00:25:55,803 --> 00:25:57,119
They are too friendly

413
00:25:57,194 --> 00:25:59,412
Check it out, run!

414
00:26:04,085 --> 00:26:06,161
Where did you throw away my phone book?

415
00:26:06,207 --> 00:26:08,259
You can call 1 08 for the number, R elease the ropes!

416
00:26:10,383 --> 00:26:12,043
They're down there!

417
00:26:12,193 --> 00:26:13,224
Hurry up!

418
00:26:15,639 --> 00:26:18,593
Start it, Start the boat!

419
00:26:19,989 --> 00:26:21,341
Freeze!

420
00:26:21,450 --> 00:26:23,074
Crap... we can't make it

421
00:26:23,121 --> 00:26:25,138
Why don't you say goodbye to our boss before you leave?

422
00:26:25,173 --> 00:26:26,347
Return ashore

423
00:26:26,391 --> 00:26:27,399
You're funny,

424
00:26:27,470 --> 00:26:29,937
Get back  ashore. I can't swim,

425
00:26:29,976 --> 00:26:31,505
Stewed celery with vegetable, plus an egg. - What?

426
00:26:31,541 --> 00:26:33,070
I said "Bullshit"

427
00:26:33,142 --> 00:26:34,530
Sit still

428
00:26:36,031 --> 00:26:37,584
Block  the boat...

429
00:26:37,632 --> 00:26:39,328
Can't 

430
00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:48,272
Stewed celery with vegetable, plus an egg

431
00:26:48,385 --> 00:26:49,357
What the hell was that?

432
00:26:49,393 --> 00:26:51,896
Put on your lifejacket and stop standing here with bullshit

433
00:27:00,982 --> 00:27:02,785
Get them....

434
00:27:07,489 --> 00:27:08,877
Jump into the cars and get them

435
00:27:08,916 --> 00:27:10,054
Yes!

436
00:27:11,212 --> 00:27:13,750
Sit still and hang in there

437
00:27:13,788 --> 00:27:16,778
it's so eye-catching if we sailed to the high seas like this

438
00:27:22,209 --> 00:27:23,347
what are you doing?

439
00:27:23,462 --> 00:27:26,938
This is so springy, I feel lik e sailing,

440
00:27:27,151 --> 00:27:29,369
I feel weird since I arrived in Hong Kong,

441
00:27:29,447 --> 00:27:31,036
But... I was never on a boat.

442
00:27:31,084 --> 00:27:32,744
I am not sure if this is seasick.

443
00:27:35,051 --> 00:27:36,996
Dad said he'll lend you this car

444
00:27:37,103 --> 00:27:39,285
So it's more convenient for you

445
00:27:40,966 --> 00:27:41,974
It's useless

446
00:27:42,323 --> 00:27:44,304
I'm unfamiliar with the roads here, I'd be lost.

447
00:27:44,341 --> 00:27:46,702
Gimme a buzz if you're lost

448
00:27:50,327 --> 00:27:51,679
It's shaking like crazy,

449
00:27:57,287 --> 00:28:00,763
It's shaking a lot because we're close to the seas

450
00:28:13,678 --> 00:28:15,207
I think you oughta sit a little further down

451
00:28:15,244 --> 00:28:16,738
The waves around here are crazy

452
00:28:19,907 --> 00:28:22,232
Stop him. stop him.

453
00:28:24,709 --> 00:28:26,061
You're too careless

454
00:28:34,801 --> 00:28:37,755
Pull over and I'll beat him up to death Be careful

455
00:28:37,967 --> 00:28:41,751
Go to hell!

456
00:28:42,978 --> 00:28:44,674
That's a huge grouper!

457
00:28:44,788 --> 00:28:46,805
Let it go, We're running for life,

458
00:28:47,085 --> 00:28:50,454
Go to hell

459
00:28:50,530 --> 00:28:51,739
Got it

460
00:28:55,472 --> 00:28:57,453
A barge!

461
00:29:16,421 --> 00:29:17,488
Tarzen

462
00:29:17,569 --> 00:29:18,577
Got one

463
00:29:18,613 --> 00:29:21,009
Hit them. Hit them, you idiot!

464
00:29:21,119 --> 00:29:23,171
They've slowed down. go get them down.

465
00:29:24,076 --> 00:29:27,231
Die-Hard. I'll go first

466
00:29:30,376 --> 00:29:33,152
We haven't arrive Shantou yet. Hold on for a bit,

467
00:29:35,282 --> 00:29:36,634
I'll get them down for you

468
00:29:44,991 --> 00:29:47,873
Die-Hard. I'm alright, No need for revenge

469
00:29:49,446 --> 00:29:52,079
Shoot us eh? Shoot us with fish gun?

470
00:29:55,535 --> 00:29:58,761
I can't drive. Help

471
00:29:58,842 --> 00:30:00,051
Look ahead...

472
00:30:00,129 --> 00:30:01,338
A dead end!

473
00:30:08,411 --> 00:30:11,293
Help! 

474
00:30:11,369 --> 00:30:12,472
Sigh... what luck!

475
00:30:19,303 --> 00:30:20,999
Have a look!

476
00:30:21,357 --> 00:30:23,504
Tarzen

477
00:30:24,941 --> 00:30:27,646
Great. great!

478
00:30:27,690 --> 00:30:28,793
Watch out!

479
00:30:30,544 --> 00:30:32,073
Are you blind? Watch out for pedestrians!

480
00:30:32,318 --> 00:30:33,741
Be careful of the car!

481
00:30:39,730 --> 00:30:42,577
Brother Wing!... Are you ok ay?

482
00:30:53,998 --> 00:30:55,836
Get the bill!

483
00:30:59,078 --> 00:31:00,050
Sorry for getting you all wet...

484
00:31:00,122 --> 00:31:02,269
We're ashore now

485
00:31:02,907 --> 00:31:05,018
Why don't you go change and,

486
00:31:05,064 --> 00:31:06,309
we'll drink somewhere else

487
00:31:06,422 --> 00:31:07,774
It's alright, I'm afraid you'll go back to the boat

488
00:31:08,127 --> 00:31:09,301
Thank you!

489
00:31:10,075 --> 00:31:11,391
It's fine

490
00:31:11,502 --> 00:31:12,890
we'll find somewhere distance from the sea

491
00:31:12,964 --> 00:31:14,316
What are they doing? Drama practice, perhaps

492
00:31:14,355 --> 00:31:15,529
Tarzen

493
00:31:15,608 --> 00:31:18,669
Tarzen... Tarzen...

494
00:31:20,585 --> 00:31:23,811
Are we there yet? It's so noisy!

495
00:31:23,856 --> 00:31:25,623
No, you're still in Hong Kong,

496
00:31:25,665 --> 00:31:27,088
You're luck y. only some minor scratches

497
00:31:27,127 --> 00:31:28,586
and the bumper is slightly dented

498
00:31:28,624 --> 00:31:30,118
All parts of lron Wing fell apart

499
00:31:30,155 --> 00:31:31,744
Most likely, a total loss

500
00:31:31,790 --> 00:31:36,417
Brother Wing... Brother Wing...

501
00:31:36,523 --> 00:31:37,875
Shut up

502
00:31:37,914 --> 00:31:39,717
I can't even hear his heartbeat

503
00:31:45,466 --> 00:31:46,995
Are you a doctor?

504
00:31:47,033 --> 00:31:47,969
What are you talk ing about?

505
00:31:48,007 --> 00:31:49,038
Are you a doctor?

506
00:31:49,085 --> 00:31:51,137
Are you blind? Don't I look lik e one?

507
00:31:51,209 --> 00:31:52,597
Fine, we don't need you,

508
00:31:52,635 --> 00:31:56,241
We've got an expert with supernatural power to help our young master

509
00:31:56,289 --> 00:31:58,056
Get out of the way!

510
00:31:58,134 --> 00:32:00,079
Supernatural power?!

511
00:32:00,222 --> 00:32:02,274
This kind a medical technology is so behind

512
00:32:02,623 --> 00:32:04,176
You can go now

513
00:32:04,466 --> 00:32:06,827
Excuse me. everybody step back

514
00:32:06,937 --> 00:32:10,686
I don't wanna hurt you with my force.

515
00:32:21,344 --> 00:32:22,280
Out of breath?

516
00:32:22,318 --> 00:32:25,094
No, my energy hasn't transferred yet

517
00:32:25,172 --> 00:32:27,912
Get out of the way. It's very powerful

518
00:32:31,019 --> 00:32:32,264
It's alright now 

519
00:32:32,341 --> 00:32:33,764
Get on with it...

520
00:32:38,953 --> 00:32:40,162
Get on 

521
00:32:46,644 --> 00:32:49,634
Dude, I've practiced feat of strength too

522
00:32:49,671 --> 00:32:51,545
Let's see whose energy is more powerful

523
00:32:51,654 --> 00:32:53,730
Stop interrupting, I'm saving a life here

524
00:32:53,952 --> 00:32:56,004
Wow. That's too much!

525
00:32:59,172 --> 00:33:00,631
Eat slowly, it's hot

526
00:33:02,372 --> 00:33:03,403
Damn you.

527
00:33:05,366 --> 00:33:07,833
Hey! Don't stop my boss from eating

528
00:33:09,472 --> 00:33:12,568
This hospital is protected by us

529
00:33:12,604 --> 00:33:15,237
Hey brother. you're stepping into a death trap

530
00:33:15,980 --> 00:33:17,676
We'll move, brother

531
00:33:17,789 --> 00:33:18,797
Alright!

532
00:33:20,434 --> 00:33:21,928
My little bro...

533
00:33:21,999 --> 00:33:23,980
Don't move!

534
00:33:24,644 --> 00:33:26,720
If you can leave this hospital,

535
00:33:26,767 --> 00:33:28,320
then I'll denounce my title as Tso, the legal advisor

536
00:33:29,029 --> 00:33:32,149
I was gonna use Wing to do something

537
00:33:32,265 --> 00:33:33,688
Look what you did to him

538
00:33:33,762 --> 00:33:35,185
I k now your driving skills aint that bad

539
00:33:35,224 --> 00:33:36,540
You'll take his place

540
00:33:36,615 --> 00:33:37,646
To do what?

541
00:33:37,763 --> 00:33:38,937
Don't ask

542
00:33:39,051 --> 00:33:42,906
From now on. k eep you cell phone on in the next 24 hours

543
00:33:42,949 --> 00:33:43,980
On call

544
00:33:44,097 --> 00:33:47,395
Otherwise, prepare to receive Tarzan's corpse!

545
00:33:49,004 --> 00:33:50,664
Let's go

546
00:34:34,974 --> 00:34:37,964
Mood. What I want are the emotions

547
00:34:38,036 --> 00:34:41,026
Simply reading the notes to play is too robotic

548
00:34:41,099 --> 00:34:43,044
There's no mood, No heart that anyone will appreciate,

549
00:34:43,117 --> 00:34:44,849
Look at,

550
00:34:44,926 --> 00:34:47,595
My hand. my face, my eyes, my feet

551
00:34:47,676 --> 00:34:49,135
Follow my body language to play music

552
00:34:49,207 --> 00:34:51,116
express the emotion inside the music

553
00:34:51,156 --> 00:34:52,852
ok?!

554
00:34:56,132 --> 00:34:58,564
I need your feelings! Fuse it...

555
00:34:58,742 --> 00:35:00,165
with the music

556
00:35:08,485 --> 00:35:09,244
Hello

557
00:35:09,321 --> 00:35:12,441
Tong Sum. where are you? Speak up!

558
00:35:12,835 --> 00:35:15,789
I'm busy right now, R ocky

559
00:35:15,933 --> 00:35:17,878
Are you with another man?

560
00:35:17,985 --> 00:35:20,274
How would I have another boyfriend?

561
00:35:20,387 --> 00:35:22,463
I'm not lying to you

562
00:35:22,510 --> 00:35:23,933
I'll call you again in a few days

563
00:35:24,006 --> 00:35:25,987
I'm helping my father with some business

564
00:35:26,024 --> 00:35:27,791
Tong Sum!

565
00:35:27,868 --> 00:35:29,184
Is that him?

566
00:35:29,261 --> 00:35:32,001
You're ditching me for a street performer?

567
00:35:35,003 --> 00:35:37,185
My dad's business is collapsing

568
00:35:44,572 --> 00:35:46,897
That's the mood I'm looking for!

569
00:35:46,974 --> 00:35:48,634
But use your instruments to express your feelings. not your stools

570
00:35:48,679 --> 00:35:50,268
Instruments eh?

571
00:35:53,202 --> 00:35:55,005
Run! Or he'll beat you up to death!

572
00:36:04,477 --> 00:36:06,066
Dare to flirt my girl?

573
00:36:06,183 --> 00:36:07,642
Tarzen treated you so well

574
00:36:07,818 --> 00:36:09,727
The least you could do is give him a visit

575
00:36:13,073 --> 00:36:14,733
Who says women are soft-hearted?

576
00:36:14,779 --> 00:36:16,403
I've begged for the whole day without any response

577
00:36:16,448 --> 00:36:17,551
No gas

578
00:36:17,875 --> 00:36:19,499
You can buy gas anytime

579
00:36:19,859 --> 00:36:21,448
But confidence can't be bought

580
00:36:21,494 --> 00:36:22,632
Take him as a friend

581
00:36:22,678 --> 00:36:24,207
And give him some moral support

582
00:36:24,453 --> 00:36:26,885
I'm afraid he'll go insane if I go see him

583
00:36:26,958 --> 00:36:28,203
Go insane?

584
00:36:28,246 --> 00:36:31,236
You can cure him and he can have "A Better T omorrow"!

585
00:36:31,308 --> 00:36:32,375
"Why me"?

586
00:36:32,422 --> 00:36:33,975
Which movie are you talking about?

587
00:36:34,614 --> 00:36:36,832
I k now, Chow Yun Fat has starred in Why me

588
00:36:36,981 --> 00:36:39,899
I k now movies very well

589
00:36:43,557 --> 00:36:44,565
Table for two

590
00:36:44,636 --> 00:36:46,225
Two? This way please!

591
00:36:47,559 --> 00:36:49,884
Aren't you seated already?

592
00:36:52,013 --> 00:36:53,780
Don't mention Tarzan

593
00:36:53,823 --> 00:36:56,076
I'm also not too fond of you

594
00:36:56,119 --> 00:36:57,957
Don't you start laying the blame on me

595
00:36:58,103 --> 00:37:01,401
Sir. please don't lean against the glass

596
00:37:01,479 --> 00:37:04,504
You're pressing against the gentleman on the other side

597
00:37:05,655 --> 00:37:07,564
Mister... please don't lean against the glass

598
00:37:07,673 --> 00:37:10,342
It's no good for you to press against the gentleman on the other side

599
00:37:15,015 --> 00:37:16,782
Can you settle down?

600
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:19,007
Didn't your mom tell you about table manners?

601
00:37:19,053 --> 00:37:21,164
You and him are birds of a feather

602
00:37:21,210 --> 00:37:22,313
People do change

603
00:37:22,393 --> 00:37:24,410
Alright, I love music. do you?

604
00:37:24,516 --> 00:37:26,212
Music?!

605
00:37:28,553 --> 00:37:30,082
Are you done singing?

606
00:37:30,745 --> 00:37:31,954
What's music?

607
00:37:32,033 --> 00:37:33,456
What else have you got to say?

608
00:37:33,494 --> 00:37:35,605
Who was that just now?

609
00:37:35,930 --> 00:37:37,590
My boyfriend

610
00:37:37,670 --> 00:37:39,817
He's like an angel from hell

611
00:37:39,932 --> 00:37:41,806
He's my partner in the fitness gym

612
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:43,576
What? Aren't you a nurse?

613
00:37:43,655 --> 00:37:45,244
I don't care about his occupation

614
00:37:45,326 --> 00:37:46,571
It's about the click

615
00:37:46,613 --> 00:37:48,451
Then, what shall I say to him?

616
00:37:48,667 --> 00:37:50,327
Say whatever you want to say

617
00:37:50,442 --> 00:37:51,758
I understand the hearts of men very well

618
00:37:51,799 --> 00:37:52,866
With the way you treat him

619
00:37:52,913 --> 00:37:54,645
He's bound to have a fight with me

620
00:37:55,139 --> 00:37:57,428
Hey. they're not talking to you

621
00:37:57,576 --> 00:37:59,343
Go explain it to him

622
00:37:59,419 --> 00:38:01,637
I'm so lost lately

623
00:38:01,786 --> 00:38:05,369
Other than the fact that you're not as manly as him

624
00:38:05,509 --> 00:38:08,249
I've actually gotten quite fond of you

625
00:38:08,363 --> 00:38:11,732
What's the use if you're fond of me?

626
00:38:12,156 --> 00:38:14,659
I didn't say it, Someone else did!

627
00:38:14,801 --> 00:38:17,126
But you should see him

628
00:38:17,341 --> 00:38:19,393
Fine! Then. I'll go with you to visit him

629
00:38:19,464 --> 00:38:21,373
I'm taking no responsibility if anything happens

630
00:38:21,483 --> 00:38:22,977
Don't worry, I'll take care of everything

631
00:38:23,048 --> 00:38:24,886
Bring us the bill please

632
00:38:25,623 --> 00:38:27,176
Ok ay, coming

633
00:38:27,328 --> 00:38:29,166
Wait for me at the door. I'm going to the washroom

634
00:38:29,278 --> 00:38:32,196
Why don't we head home earlier for today? I have a rehearsal to attend

635
00:38:32,235 --> 00:38:33,136
and 

636
00:38:33,210 --> 00:38:35,677
Here's your bill, sir!

637
00:38:35,785 --> 00:38:38,181
I didn't order anything, What's the bill for?

638
00:38:38,291 --> 00:38:40,236
Something's wrong with my eyes

639
00:38:40,622 --> 00:38:42,211
Sir. here's your bill!

640
00:38:42,501 --> 00:38:44,553
He's not that mean after all

641
00:38:44,659 --> 00:38:46,355
Here comes your partner again

642
00:38:48,487 --> 00:38:50,254
Go hide yourself

643
00:38:59,936 --> 00:39:01,774
What about it? - Go hide

644
00:39:03,068 --> 00:39:04,835
Tong Sum

645
00:39:07,592 --> 00:39:10,712
You jerk! Stay there!

646
00:39:10,758 --> 00:39:13,225
You're mock ing on my girlfriend, jerk!

647
00:39:13,508 --> 00:39:15,797
Easy there, R ocky! Don't be stupid

648
00:39:15,944 --> 00:39:17,604
You jerk...

649
00:39:18,519 --> 00:39:19,586
Don't get so rash!

650
00:39:19,702 --> 00:39:21,362
Tong Sum. I want you do know

651
00:39:21,407 --> 00:39:22,415
what a real man is - R un

652
00:39:22,695 --> 00:39:23,275
He'll k ill you

653
00:39:23,321 --> 00:39:25,266
I'll knock you out, you street performer!

654
00:39:27,671 --> 00:39:30,411
Stand still. Tong Sum

655
00:39:36,335 --> 00:39:37,995
What's going on. buddy?

656
00:39:38,076 --> 00:39:40,093
Don't hit him. get me instead

657
00:39:40,198 --> 00:39:42,309
Missy, why are you so nice to a stranger?

658
00:39:42,495 --> 00:39:43,669
Get away!

659
00:39:45,837 --> 00:39:47,854
Run. I'll hold it for you.

660
00:39:48,029 --> 00:39:49,558
Hurry up and run!

661
00:39:49,664 --> 00:39:51,158
Missy

662
00:39:51,195 --> 00:39:53,627
You're hurting my male ego by saying that here

663
00:40:05,288 --> 00:40:07,091
Muscles!

664
00:40:07,933 --> 00:40:09,771
Here's your change, mister!

665
00:40:10,195 --> 00:40:11,654
Keep the change

666
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:14,151
This sport wear... Hold her

667
00:40:14,267 --> 00:40:15,275
Hold it

668
00:40:15,345 --> 00:40:16,934
Are you done yet?

669
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:25,432
I don't k now you.

670
00:40:25,508 --> 00:40:26,896
I don't k now you either

671
00:40:29,474 --> 00:40:31,692
Sorry!

672
00:40:33,441 --> 00:40:35,458
What took you so long!

673
00:40:38,140 --> 00:40:40,287
What are you scared for?

674
00:40:40,332 --> 00:40:41,992
Didn't pay the bills? -I did!

675
00:40:42,106 --> 00:40:43,730
There aren't your clothes

676
00:40:43,777 --> 00:40:45,165
You stole this after walk ing around?

677
00:40:45,204 --> 00:40:46,307
What? Steal what?

678
00:40:46,352 --> 00:40:47,668
Playing coy with me. aren't you?

679
00:40:47,779 --> 00:40:49,855
What a nice car

680
00:40:49,971 --> 00:40:52,889
You are using your customer's car in your garage. aren't you?

681
00:40:55,052 --> 00:40:57,199
Not bad. Does it belong to a doctor or a lawyer?

682
00:40:57,314 --> 00:40:58,381
Where are you going. miss?

683
00:40:58,462 --> 00:41:00,015
Let's go

684
00:41:00,168 --> 00:41:01,697
Real leather!

685
00:41:05,005 --> 00:41:06,179
Stop it...

686
00:41:07,580 --> 00:41:09,240
What a cheap ass.

687
00:41:09,632 --> 00:41:11,708
Your turn!

688
00:41:12,034 --> 00:41:13,493
You're playing dirty tricks,

689
00:41:13,635 --> 00:41:15,616
We gotta go! - Sir. I rented this booth to work

690
00:41:15,723 --> 00:41:17,182
I don't want to bother you. he was hitting me first

691
00:41:21,639 --> 00:41:23,168
Hey! I really don't know you

692
00:41:23,274 --> 00:41:25,291
Don't know huh?

693
00:41:25,397 --> 00:41:26,986
I don't k now you two either

694
00:41:27,380 --> 00:41:28,696
I'll kick  your head

695
00:41:28,842 --> 00:41:29,850
Knee?!

696
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:33,952
Damn you!

697
00:41:38,969 --> 00:41:40,107
Look out

698
00:41:40,222 --> 00:41:41,846
So you're sk illed in combat too

699
00:41:46,450 --> 00:41:48,003
This is frustrating They are expensive

700
00:41:53,271 --> 00:41:54,730
Everything is gone

701
00:41:54,837 --> 00:41:56,390
Hey. punk! Why didn't you borrow it to me?

702
00:41:56,438 --> 00:41:57,374
It's all gone!

703
00:41:59,222 --> 00:42:01,298
Gotta pick up as much as I can

704
00:42:06,634 --> 00:42:08,710
That's enough for you!

705
00:42:08,862 --> 00:42:11,115
I'll retaliate if you insist to continue

706
00:42:16,830 --> 00:42:19,463
You're hitting my face -I told you to stop

707
00:42:20,067 --> 00:42:21,383
Just a second

708
00:42:21,494 --> 00:42:23,368
My stuff was all broken. Who's gonna pay me back?

709
00:42:24,069 --> 00:42:25,836
Honestly. the loser pays. right?

710
00:42:27,862 --> 00:42:28,893
Again?!

711
00:42:29,950 --> 00:42:32,026
You're pretty strong.

712
00:42:32,142 --> 00:42:33,458
I'll going. He is rich

713
00:42:33,533 --> 00:42:35,193
You're rich! Pay for it, now! I have nothing!

714
00:42:35,239 --> 00:42:36,342
Nothing eh?

715
00:42:42,791 --> 00:42:44,772
He hit me!

716
00:42:44,913 --> 00:42:46,466
Marvelous!

717
00:42:46,549 --> 00:42:48,173
I never k new you before

718
00:42:48,289 --> 00:42:49,012
What are you doing?

719
00:42:49,089 --> 00:42:52,600
From this moment onwards, I'll really get to know you

720
00:42:52,709 --> 00:42:55,734
I think so. What do you want?

721
00:42:55,771 --> 00:42:57,752
Stop making jokes!

722
00:42:57,823 --> 00:43:01,192
Stop making jokes? Let's make something else

723
00:43:02,835 --> 00:43:04,115
What's your name. missy?

724
00:43:04,227 --> 00:43:06,065
Barbara

725
00:43:06,175 --> 00:43:08,808
You've ask ed me that 1 0 times already, Die-Hard!

726
00:43:09,864 --> 00:43:11,940
I'm not Die-Hard. I'm Yau Ma!

727
00:43:12,056 --> 00:43:13,645
Missy, where can I tak e you to?

728
00:43:13,727 --> 00:43:15,150
To see Tarzen!

729
00:43:15,571 --> 00:43:17,588
Tarzen? You wanna watch that movie?

730
00:43:17,729 --> 00:43:19,746
Well. you did say we'll visit him

731
00:43:19,852 --> 00:43:21,584
I did?

732
00:43:21,696 --> 00:43:23,249
It's a waste of talent if you're not an actor

733
00:43:23,367 --> 00:43:25,348
Right, I took opera in university.

734
00:43:25,489 --> 00:43:27,018
You sing opera?!

735
00:43:27,125 --> 00:43:28,263
Sure, I do!

736
00:43:31,996 --> 00:43:34,072
Very good, not bad at all

737
00:43:39,618 --> 00:43:40,898
You know that too?

738
00:43:41,009 --> 00:43:42,562
Sure, I do!

739
00:43:42,889 --> 00:43:44,870
I got my 9th grade in piano when I was 8,

740
00:43:44,942 --> 00:43:47,860
When I was 12. I got into the R oyal Music Conservatory

741
00:43:47,970 --> 00:43:50,331
Got the Beethoven Conducting Award when I was 20

742
00:43:50,441 --> 00:43:53,846
I k now, and you're rich too!

743
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:55,165
Well!

744
00:43:55,242 --> 00:43:58,338
Yeah. So you must have returned from studying abroad in another country

745
00:43:58,480 --> 00:43:59,689
How did you know?

746
00:43:59,732 --> 00:44:01,677
Oh, of course

747
00:44:01,785 --> 00:44:03,967
So you have a very keen interest in music, right?

748
00:44:04,047 --> 00:44:06,064
My father was a piano teacher in Mainland China

749
00:44:06,135 --> 00:44:09,469
You know. the situation wasn't all that great several decades ago

750
00:44:09,545 --> 00:44:11,205
He didn't leave me much

751
00:44:11,285 --> 00:44:13,681
He only left him his knowledge to me so I can make a living

752
00:44:14,208 --> 00:44:17,684
Too bad he passed away before I made his dreams come true

753
00:44:19,463 --> 00:44:22,132
You'll have the chance

754
00:44:28,058 --> 00:44:29,587
Its so big!

755
00:44:29,694 --> 00:44:32,541
Hey. you made me so comfortable last time

756
00:44:32,583 --> 00:44:34,243
Can you do it for me again?

757
00:44:34,288 --> 00:44:36,921
I'm good at repairing cars and nothing else

758
00:44:37,001 --> 00:44:39,219
I'll wait for you in bed

759
00:44:45,249 --> 00:44:47,681
This joke has gotten really big

760
00:44:47,824 --> 00:44:53,032
I can probably do that too. I'll try it out on her

761
00:45:02,371 --> 00:45:04,767
What about it? Beethoven!

762
00:45:04,842 --> 00:45:06,787
You wanna listen to some Beethoven?

763
00:45:18,518 --> 00:45:19,490
Stop!

764
00:45:19,736 --> 00:45:20,839
What's wrong?

765
00:45:20,919 --> 00:45:22,543
Keep going!

766
00:45:30,140 --> 00:45:31,669
Nothing, next song

767
00:45:31,741 --> 00:45:32,986
Ok ay

768
00:46:09,429 --> 00:46:11,682
Give it a try. C'mon!

769
00:46:11,725 --> 00:46:17,978
Me?! No... Don't!

770
00:46:19,625 --> 00:46:21,357
C'mon.

771
00:46:28,220 --> 00:46:29,714
Close your eyes

772
00:46:30,030 --> 00:46:31,619
Imagine it's your recital

773
00:46:38,103 --> 00:46:43,904
Can achievements bring you to a determined rank?

774
00:46:46,977 --> 00:46:53,171
Can money and reputation mak e you a better person

775
00:46:55,399 --> 00:46:58,768
Success and failure might not determine victory and loss

776
00:46:58,878 --> 00:47:04,478
Its difficult to differentiate between pretty and ugly. good and evil

777
00:47:05,178 --> 00:47:11,372
Can the importance of a lover be measured

778
00:47:12,660 --> 00:47:17,216
Although, everything can't be clearly identified

779
00:47:17,323 --> 00:47:21,843
If you love him so deeply. you don't need to ask

780
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:25,838
Love remains in our dreams

781
00:47:26,509 --> 00:47:29,985
Heart-to-heart with no regrets

782
00:47:30,859 --> 00:47:35,687
Each day, we meet and share our lives together

783
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:40,071
Our hearts come close for eternity

784
00:47:41,403 --> 00:47:47,619
Nothing to consider and regardless of the situation

785
00:48:01,761 --> 00:48:06,103
What's wrong? I'm waiting for you. Hurry up!

786
00:48:07,642 --> 00:48:09,516
Damn you!

787
00:48:09,556 --> 00:48:15,772
Can destiny give results to love?

788
00:48:18,778 --> 00:48:25,351
Can an oath guarantee that love is real

789
00:48:27,234 --> 00:48:30,295
Spending time apart doesn't mean it's either good or bad 

790
00:48:30,784 --> 00:48:36,099
Love is blind, and hard to distinguish

791
00:48:37,187 --> 00:48:43,381
Can the importance of love be measured?

792
00:48:52,672 --> 00:48:55,483
You drink  and smoke?

793
00:48:55,526 --> 00:48:58,123
I get drunk several times each night.

794
00:48:59,423 --> 00:49:01,605
What were we doing just now?

795
00:49:01,685 --> 00:49:03,867
You asked me to get on bed!

796
00:49:03,982 --> 00:49:05,963
It wasn't lik e that last time

797
00:49:06,070 --> 00:49:08,252
Haven't I had sex with you before?

798
00:49:08,367 --> 00:49:09,826
What kind of person did you think  I am?

799
00:49:09,898 --> 00:49:12,045
I didn't tak e you as a whore, Don't tak e me as a gigolo either!

800
00:49:12,717 --> 00:49:15,042
Whore? Gigolo?

801
00:49:16,197 --> 00:49:17,726
Go grab the phone

802
00:49:17,832 --> 00:49:20,085
You thought we're shopping in a red light district?

803
00:49:20,164 --> 00:49:22,382
What music recital were you talk ing about just now?

804
00:49:22,461 --> 00:49:23,813
That's what I'm here for

805
00:49:23,923 --> 00:49:26,105
What? When are you going to stop k idding around?

806
00:49:26,219 --> 00:49:29,374
Hey! My boss is off to Japan

807
00:49:29,421 --> 00:49:30,773
So don't give me any threats

808
00:49:30,812 --> 00:49:33,623
You're so rude! What's your name?

809
00:49:33,666 --> 00:49:34,697
Security!

810
00:49:34,745 --> 00:49:35,919
Die-Hard. stop playing around

811
00:49:35,962 --> 00:49:36,578
Kick him out!

812
00:49:36,693 --> 00:49:38,674
Sir... - What's the matter?

813
00:49:38,886 --> 00:49:41,033
It's nothing. He's just causing a ruck us here. I want to 

814
00:49:41,113 --> 00:49:42,916
Mr, Ma - Yes!

815
00:49:43,097 --> 00:49:44,864
You understand that your boss has been sent to Japan

816
00:49:44,907 --> 00:49:46,187
This happened because of his attitude towards the guests

817
00:49:46,229 --> 00:49:47,782
In fact l  -Apologize right away

818
00:49:48,526 --> 00:49:49,664
Sorry!

819
00:49:49,744 --> 00:49:52,105
Go back  to your work  It's alright!

820
00:49:52,389 --> 00:49:54,571
Nice meeting you. Mr, Ma

821
00:49:54,685 --> 00:49:57,188
Alright  enough, It's ok,

822
00:49:57,330 --> 00:49:58,302
I am sorry!

823
00:49:58,339 --> 00:49:59,311
I'm heading back  to my room

824
00:49:59,383 --> 00:50:01,292
Mr, Ma, your concert at 2pm is about to begin

825
00:50:01,436 --> 00:50:05,114
Right, I almost forgot

826
00:50:05,229 --> 00:50:07,067
I think you should tak e a rest

827
00:50:07,177 --> 00:50:09,194
We'll keep it a secret

828
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:10,412
Enjoy!

829
00:50:11,806 --> 00:50:13,858
Your last name's Ma? - Yes!

830
00:50:13,894 --> 00:50:15,210
Artists need love too

831
00:50:15,321 --> 00:50:17,753
Why did you dress me like that

832
00:50:17,791 --> 00:50:19,250
Honestly. one night stand is nothing

833
00:50:19,288 --> 00:50:21,162
You think  you can do whatever to me? - What are you talk ing about?

834
00:50:21,654 --> 00:50:23,278
Come, let's have a k iss

835
00:50:23,324 --> 00:50:25,957
Behave! Thousands of people are waiting for your performance

836
00:50:26,005 --> 00:50:27,357
You're kidding me! Me and you?

837
00:50:27,431 --> 00:50:29,613
Zip it up! -Hey! Tak e it easy,

838
00:50:29,658 --> 00:50:31,152
Elevator's here, hurry up...

839
00:50:31,259 --> 00:50:32,647
Where are we going to?

840
00:50:35,365 --> 00:50:37,310
How much did you pay for the show?

841
00:50:37,384 --> 00:50:39,293
The rent's $2000 per day

842
00:50:39,402 --> 00:50:40,611
$2000?

843
00:50:40,725 --> 00:50:41,970
U.S, dollars

844
00:50:42,081 --> 00:50:44,334
This little game is really pricy

845
00:50:44,656 --> 00:50:46,185
Here comes trouble

846
00:50:48,832 --> 00:50:50,670
Run quick! - For what?

847
00:50:59,969 --> 00:51:01,392
Stop fooling around

848
00:51:01,500 --> 00:51:03,409
I'm not fooling around - Who is he?

849
00:51:03,448 --> 00:51:04,456
I don't k now

850
00:51:07,868 --> 00:51:09,944
Master - What?

851
00:51:10,026 --> 00:51:12,102
Please take me as your student, Master!

852
00:51:12,218 --> 00:51:14,507
I beg you to tak e me in

853
00:51:14,549 --> 00:51:15,794
I want to learn from you

854
00:51:15,907 --> 00:51:17,436
Learn from me? - Yes!

855
00:51:17,577 --> 00:51:20,246
Please take me and teach me

856
00:51:22,101 --> 00:51:23,797
What grade were you in?

857
00:51:23,875 --> 00:51:27,351
8th grade K,arate and 9th grade T aekwondo

858
00:51:29,373 --> 00:51:31,140
You wanna learn from him with this kind of qualification?

859
00:51:31,323 --> 00:51:32,603
Please take me

860
00:51:32,715 --> 00:51:33,438
I guess there's misunderstanding

861
00:51:33,549 --> 00:51:34,343
I'm a musician

862
00:51:34,385 --> 00:51:36,638
I k now Do-Re-Me but not Ka-ra-te

863
00:51:36,681 --> 00:51:38,175
I don't lik e fighting either

864
00:51:38,248 --> 00:51:40,122
Y ea, he doesn't like fighting

865
00:51:40,162 --> 00:51:41,656
But he has supernatural powers

866
00:51:41,797 --> 00:51:42,733
Supernatural powers?

867
00:51:42,876 --> 00:51:44,679
Master. I also don't lik e to fight

868
00:51:44,825 --> 00:51:46,770
I'm a changed man

869
00:51:46,912 --> 00:51:50,317
Look. it was you who gave me these bruises

870
00:51:50,393 --> 00:51:51,709
Everyone one of them.

871
00:51:51,750 --> 00:51:54,288
Represent my determination to become your disciple

872
00:51:54,325 --> 00:51:56,021
Did you really beat him up lik e that?

873
00:51:56,065 --> 00:51:56,752
You've got it wrong.

874
00:51:56,795 --> 00:51:58,562
He didn't beat me It was a lesson brought upon by Master

875
00:52:01,911 --> 00:52:03,714
Even looks convincing too

876
00:52:03,860 --> 00:52:06,742
Please. master. Take me as your disciple! No

877
00:52:06,957 --> 00:52:07,858
I beg you

878
00:52:09,984 --> 00:52:10,920
I'll tak e you

879
00:52:11,064 --> 00:52:13,211
Great... this is so great.

880
00:52:13,326 --> 00:52:15,473
Master. when will I begin my lessons with you?

881
00:52:15,553 --> 00:52:16,383
Right away

882
00:52:16,458 --> 00:52:18,534
Go buy a piano and play it daily for 6 hours

883
00:52:18,754 --> 00:52:19,762
Piano?

884
00:52:19,867 --> 00:52:20,768
What is that for?

885
00:52:20,877 --> 00:52:21,980
To practice your fingers

886
00:52:22,095 --> 00:52:25,915
Oh right. for strength on my fingers

887
00:52:25,992 --> 00:52:26,786
I understand. master

888
00:52:26,898 --> 00:52:28,178
When shall I begin the practice?

889
00:52:28,254 --> 00:52:30,021
Right away. Now say goodbye

890
00:52:30,098 --> 00:52:31,521
Goodbye. master

891
00:52:32,813 --> 00:52:34,473
Goodbye. master

892
00:52:34,623 --> 00:52:35,631
Is that your wife?

893
00:52:35,841 --> 00:52:37,858
Byebye.... -Nonsense

894
00:52:37,893 --> 00:52:39,067
Let's leave it as it is

895
00:52:39,111 --> 00:52:42,065
Take care. Master! -Bye

896
00:52:42,452 --> 00:52:45,442
This bulk y guy that you hired definitely has terrible acting

897
00:52:45,480 --> 00:52:46,903
Who'd be convinced of you?

898
00:52:46,942 --> 00:52:47,914
I don't even believe it myself

899
00:52:48,020 --> 00:52:50,238
Crap! I have to get to the press conference

900
00:52:50,282 --> 00:52:52,299
What? A press conference?

901
00:52:53,240 --> 00:52:54,699
Let's go

902
00:52:57,416 --> 00:52:58,625
You really look lik e a musician

903
00:52:58,738 --> 00:53:00,090
What? I am one

904
00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:02,038
You thought I was lying all along?

905
00:53:02,149 --> 00:53:03,501
Obviously

906
00:53:03,610 --> 00:53:05,377
But I'm falling for it

907
00:53:14,781 --> 00:53:16,204
I have no idea where she's taking me to

908
00:53:16,312 --> 00:53:17,865
When would this end?

909
00:53:17,983 --> 00:53:20,344
I'm going to the washroom first

910
00:53:24,003 --> 00:53:25,699
Again?

911
00:53:25,848 --> 00:53:27,022
What's wrong with Barbara?

912
00:53:27,100 --> 00:53:29,638
She keeps following me

913
00:53:43,664 --> 00:53:44,980
Ghost!

914
00:53:45,091 --> 00:53:46,894
Why do you look exactly the same as I do?

915
00:53:47,284 --> 00:53:48,980
Even the clothes look the same

916
00:53:52,643 --> 00:53:53,817
Y eah!

917
00:53:53,931 --> 00:53:56,956
Are you human or ghost? Why are we exactly the same?

918
00:53:57,063 --> 00:53:58,687
Right, I'm glad I ran into you here

919
00:53:58,802 --> 00:54:01,613
It'd cause a scene if others see it

920
00:54:01,726 --> 00:54:06,448
Oh, that short hair girl must have thought I was you.

921
00:54:06,563 --> 00:54:08,472
That's why she dressed me like this

922
00:54:08,511 --> 00:54:09,305
Damn you

923
00:54:09,381 --> 00:54:11,634
That long hair girl thought I was you!

924
00:54:11,713 --> 00:54:13,242
That's why she thought I was lying about the concert

925
00:54:13,348 --> 00:54:15,495
Concert? You're the street performer!

926
00:54:15,610 --> 00:54:16,440
So?

927
00:54:16,550 --> 00:54:18,282
It's nothing. Hey. do you get it now?

928
00:54:18,394 --> 00:54:21,099
I got it, R emember to return my clothes to me

929
00:54:21,178 --> 00:54:23,087
I don't want to cause another ruckus

930
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:25,421
Alright, You also shouldn't mention to the girl...

931
00:54:25,459 --> 00:54:26,597
that I disguised myself as you, ok ay?

932
00:54:27,581 --> 00:54:28,719
You know Barbara?

933
00:54:28,834 --> 00:54:30,387
What? You've seen Barbara?

934
00:54:30,504 --> 00:54:32,521
I'm not sure if it was her

935
00:54:32,662 --> 00:54:34,358
She just jumped into my car

936
00:54:34,436 --> 00:54:36,239
And kept saying to see Tarzen

937
00:54:36,907 --> 00:54:39,683
So I just bought her the movie

938
00:54:46,268 --> 00:54:48,285
Hey. why do we sneeze at the same time?

939
00:54:48,356 --> 00:54:50,230
That's right!

940
00:54:50,757 --> 00:54:52,145
Have you been on a boat lately?

941
00:54:52,184 --> 00:54:53,085
Yeah!

942
00:54:53,228 --> 00:54:56,324
My God! No wonder I felt seasick

943
00:54:56,430 --> 00:54:58,506
Did you react when I came looking for a prostitute?

944
00:54:58,657 --> 00:54:59,973
So. did you really do it?

945
00:55:00,084 --> 00:55:01,780
Why should I tell you?

946
00:55:04,016 --> 00:55:05,569
I hope that was not his reaction

947
00:55:05,651 --> 00:55:07,275
Hey!...

948
00:55:07,670 --> 00:55:09,223
I don't lik e people patting my shoulder

949
00:55:09,480 --> 00:55:11,425
You forgot your cell!

950
00:55:12,959 --> 00:55:14,868
Thank... You

951
00:55:16,892 --> 00:55:19,288
Damn street performer!

952
00:55:20,476 --> 00:55:22,172
What took you so long?

953
00:55:23,852 --> 00:55:26,390
Mr, Ma, this way please.

954
00:55:29,907 --> 00:55:31,295
Done with the washroom?

955
00:55:31,368 --> 00:55:32,791
Barbara, what are you doing here?

956
00:55:32,865 --> 00:55:33,932
You alright?

957
00:55:34,013 --> 00:55:36,266
You brought me here! Your room's really nice!

958
00:55:37,041 --> 00:55:38,844
Since when have we been this close?

959
00:55:38,920 --> 00:55:41,423
Today! In the room!

960
00:55:41,529 --> 00:55:43,403
In the room?

961
00:55:43,513 --> 00:55:45,209
Did you went up with me?

962
00:55:45,323 --> 00:55:47,340
What's wrong with you? You forgot about it already?

963
00:55:47,619 --> 00:55:49,148
What did I do?

964
00:55:49,186 --> 00:55:50,253
What did he do?

965
00:55:50,299 --> 00:55:51,200
He...

966
00:55:51,239 --> 00:55:52,033
You don't know what you've done?

967
00:55:52,109 --> 00:55:53,638
Do I have to k eep reminding you?

968
00:55:53,710 --> 00:55:55,727
If he did it. I did it too

969
00:55:55,798 --> 00:55:57,672
I'll see if you remember it!

970
00:55:57,746 --> 00:55:59,822
Didn't you say you were going to buy me a Tarzan movie on VHS?

971
00:55:59,938 --> 00:56:01,776
When did Tarzan make a movie?

972
00:56:02,896 --> 00:56:04,176
Stop that

973
00:56:05,681 --> 00:56:06,582
Hey

974
00:56:06,655 --> 00:56:07,520
Hey. Die-Hard

975
00:56:07,594 --> 00:56:08,353
Die-Hard?

976
00:56:08,394 --> 00:56:11,134
I've been look ing for you. You got to show up

977
00:56:11,179 --> 00:56:13,575
I'm not Die-Hard. You've got the wrong number

978
00:56:15,876 --> 00:56:17,572
I grabbed the wrong cell phone

979
00:56:17,721 --> 00:56:19,903
The phone belongs to him -Liar

980
00:56:20,088 --> 00:56:21,333
Damn street performer

981
00:56:21,375 --> 00:56:23,071
He must have done similar things I've done

982
00:56:27,152 --> 00:56:28,468
I'll check up later

983
00:56:29,935 --> 00:56:32,046
Hey. Die-Hard

984
00:56:32,372 --> 00:56:34,839
I'm inside. Where are you?

985
00:56:34,877 --> 00:56:35,908
I'm outside right now

986
00:56:36,025 --> 00:56:38,907
Come on in! I have to protect Barbara

987
00:56:39,053 --> 00:56:40,927
This place is so dangerous

988
00:56:41,976 --> 00:56:43,079
I can't come in yet

989
00:56:43,194 --> 00:56:44,854
Come out and explain in for me. okay?

990
00:56:45,004 --> 00:56:47,151
I would have done it if I could

991
00:56:47,648 --> 00:56:48,620
I'm...

992
00:56:48,692 --> 00:56:50,768
Hello...

993
00:56:51,476 --> 00:56:53,872
Damn it. Out of batteries at this time!

994
00:56:54,329 --> 00:56:56,618
Wait here for me, I'll go grab my phone

995
00:56:57,671 --> 00:56:58,738
You're late

996
00:56:58,819 --> 00:57:00,408
I won't be long

997
00:57:01,116 --> 00:57:03,168
Wai's here for me, Stay there

998
00:57:14,165 --> 00:57:16,418
Mr, Ma, this way please

999
00:57:17,367 --> 00:57:19,514
Done? I've been waiting

1000
00:57:19,595 --> 00:57:21,148
Why is Wai waiting for me in the car?

1001
00:57:23,457 --> 00:57:25,474
Time's up

1002
00:57:25,580 --> 00:57:26,932
Stop fooling around

1003
00:57:27,041 --> 00:57:28,321
Let's go

1004
00:57:28,434 --> 00:57:29,264
Ok ay!

1005
00:57:29,373 --> 00:57:31,069
Where are we going to?

1006
00:57:31,321 --> 00:57:33,124
The concert!

1007
00:57:35,463 --> 00:57:38,618
Don't tell me he just left on that car

1008
00:57:38,734 --> 00:57:40,679
You saw it

1009
00:57:43,432 --> 00:57:45,614
You think  I'm seeing things?

1010
00:57:45,972 --> 00:57:51,323
God When did you get off the car?

1011
00:57:52,131 --> 00:57:53,198
What's going on?

1012
00:57:53,872 --> 00:57:55,781
Nice, I gotta explain one thing to you

1013
00:57:55,820 --> 00:57:57,029
Don't touch me

1014
00:57:57,142 --> 00:57:58,636
You act as if you don't know us

1015
00:57:58,709 --> 00:57:59,717
I really don't

1016
00:57:59,787 --> 00:58:02,076
Tarzan's on our hands, So. don't you play tricks on me!

1017
00:58:02,119 --> 00:58:02,913
You guys like watching Tarzan too?

1018
00:58:02,989 --> 00:58:04,970
Just keep in mind that we have Tarzan

1019
00:58:05,112 --> 00:58:06,606
Mak e it clear, I'm confused

1020
00:58:06,712 --> 00:58:07,992
Barbara

1021
00:58:08,174 --> 00:58:10,985
I k new what happened when I was in the washroom

1022
00:58:11,132 --> 00:58:14,014
You knew? You just got out from there

1023
00:58:14,125 --> 00:58:15,821
And keep asking me what happened

1024
00:58:16,665 --> 00:58:18,361
What did I tell you then?

1025
00:58:18,405 --> 00:58:20,422
Do you wanna ask  me again. what have you done?

1026
00:58:20,528 --> 00:58:22,853
No, but I'd be better if you tell me again.

1027
00:58:22,999 --> 00:58:24,695
take them both

1028
00:58:24,773 --> 00:58:26,505
Take them

1029
00:58:26,931 --> 00:58:29,007
Who are you people?

1030
00:58:35,422 --> 00:58:38,127
Hey. I don't k now the place. What do you want me to do?

1031
00:58:38,171 --> 00:58:39,179
Want you to save someone!

1032
00:58:39,214 --> 00:58:40,874
How great! Who do you want to rescue?

1033
00:58:40,955 --> 00:58:44,253
Our boss will be transferred to another prison today He's right in that car

1034
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:46,973
Are you kidding? Carjack ing a patrol wagon is a serious offense

1035
00:58:47,079 --> 00:58:49,676
With your skills. it's time you should show us what you got

1036
00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:52,607
If you fail. you can say goodbye to Tarzan and Barbara

1037
00:58:52,717 --> 00:58:54,591
Calm down!

1038
00:58:54,805 --> 00:58:56,014
Relax

1039
00:58:56,128 --> 00:58:57,551
You look  more nervous than I am

1040
00:59:02,566 --> 00:59:04,333
This is your concert

1041
00:59:04,375 --> 00:59:05,655
I didn't wanna come, You dragged me over here!

1042
00:59:05,698 --> 00:59:07,430
Don't fool around

1043
00:59:07,890 --> 00:59:10,251
Unless you say you're not Yau Ma

1044
00:59:10,708 --> 00:59:13,246
I'm really not Yau Ma. I'm Die-Hard

1045
00:59:13,493 --> 00:59:16,827
Don't joke with your future, Now go!

1046
00:59:17,703 --> 00:59:20,894
I hate people making fun of one's future

1047
00:59:21,426 --> 00:59:24,202
If you walk away, that's it for Yau Ma

1048
00:59:24,350 --> 00:59:26,046
Why don't you go out?

1049
00:59:26,263 --> 00:59:28,030
Got no guts?

1050
00:59:29,326 --> 00:59:31,793
I've got guts. but you're tak ing the consequence

1051
00:59:35,034 --> 00:59:37,631
I k now what the consequences are

1052
00:59:39,348 --> 00:59:40,700
So many people!

1053
00:59:40,809 --> 00:59:41,947
What are you doing?

1054
00:59:42,097 --> 00:59:43,626
How can I handle the crowd

1055
00:59:43,698 --> 00:59:45,121
Right, the baton

1056
00:59:45,229 --> 00:59:46,296
Isn't it a baseball bat?

1057
00:59:46,413 --> 00:59:48,738
We'll use a baseball bat next time

1058
00:59:49,718 --> 00:59:51,450
Damn you!

1059
01:00:00,123 --> 01:00:01,226
Take action!

1060
01:00:11,399 --> 01:00:12,751
Their firepower is so much stronger than ours

1061
01:00:12,825 --> 01:00:15,328
Contact headquarters 

1062
01:00:19,715 --> 01:00:21,767
Back off, back  off.

1063
01:00:23,230 --> 01:00:25,068
Don't be afraid, boss, I'm here to save you

1064
01:00:53,819 --> 01:00:55,657
Is that possible?

1065
01:01:06,103 --> 01:01:09,543
Take it easy! Don't be afraid  -Stop grabbing my hand

1066
01:01:13,411 --> 01:01:15,035
Wait for me here, relax,

1067
01:01:15,081 --> 01:01:16,777
You two. off the car - Yes!

1068
01:01:17,030 --> 01:01:18,939
What the hell? It won't budge!

1069
01:01:19,049 --> 01:01:20,994
The safety switch! Don't panic.

1070
01:01:21,101 --> 01:01:22,595
Calm down!

1071
01:01:43,964 --> 01:01:44,687
What?

1072
01:01:44,730 --> 01:01:46,462
Isn't that good enough for a porno?

1073
01:01:46,539 --> 01:01:48,413
Alright, cut that dialogue scene and

1074
01:01:48,453 --> 01:01:50,077
replace it with some scenes of bestiality

1075
01:01:54,439 --> 01:01:55,933
C'mon. be quick!

1076
01:01:58,754 --> 01:02:00,936
Look for something like two bulls with a girl, no...

1077
01:02:00,981 --> 01:02:02,119
Two pigs to be exact!

1078
01:02:02,165 --> 01:02:04,003
Bulls or pigs? Make your choice and call him back

1079
01:02:11,630 --> 01:02:13,219
Hello - Who are you?

1080
01:02:13,404 --> 01:02:16,001
Die-Hard! Where are you? Come and save me

1081
01:02:16,049 --> 01:02:18,481
Bro. come help me too

1082
01:02:18,520 --> 01:02:20,631
I'm performing for you at your concert

1083
01:02:20,678 --> 01:02:22,101
The conducting is a complete mess, brother!

1084
01:02:22,243 --> 01:02:25,339
It's worse than the Persian Gulf over here. Come and help me out here!

1085
01:02:25,375 --> 01:02:26,311
What's with Persian Gulf,

1086
01:02:26,385 --> 01:02:28,958
The Persian Gulf War! It's a battlefield out here

1087
01:02:28,995 --> 01:02:30,524
Listen if you don't believe me

1088
01:02:35,328 --> 01:02:37,166
What am I going to do now?

1089
01:02:37,312 --> 01:02:40,302
Scoundrel's motto, if you don't realize the situation,

1090
01:02:40,339 --> 01:02:41,999
Do not reveal yourself

1091
01:02:42,045 --> 01:02:42,910
Normally under these circumstances

1092
01:02:43,019 --> 01:02:45,000
we should stay on the ground as much as possible

1093
01:02:45,107 --> 01:02:46,731
Did you hear me?

1094
01:02:46,812 --> 01:02:48,401
You are now tak ing my spot

1095
01:02:48,483 --> 01:02:52,066
Just do what you think I'd do with the situation

1096
01:02:52,310 --> 01:02:53,899
You're tak ing my spot as well.

1097
01:02:53,945 --> 01:02:55,890
Just do whatever you think  I might do

1098
01:02:55,929 --> 01:02:57,732
Einstein once said

1099
01:02:57,844 --> 01:02:59,232
A good orchestra needs a conductor

1100
01:02:59,271 --> 01:03:01,560
A lousy one has an agitator

1101
01:03:01,776 --> 01:03:03,685
Get out!

1102
01:03:06,752 --> 01:03:08,376
Best of luck

1103
01:03:08,492 --> 01:03:11,446
Get out, go and open that patrol wagon -Let me cover my face first

1104
01:03:13,434 --> 01:03:14,643
You got a light?

1105
01:03:14,756 --> 01:03:16,773
Y es!

1106
01:03:28,954 --> 01:03:34,032
Damn you! I'll just do it!

1107
01:03:56,028 --> 01:03:57,902
It's started already

1108
01:03:57,977 --> 01:03:59,186
Start the car

1109
01:03:59,229 --> 01:04:00,545
This idiot still can't get it open

1110
01:04:00,587 --> 01:04:01,903
Who's that? He look s scary!

1111
01:04:02,014 --> 01:04:03,223
He's the boss of my boss

1112
01:04:03,336 --> 01:04:05,803
The biggest one?

1113
01:04:05,911 --> 01:04:08,129
If you don't start driving quickly you will have the biggest trouble

1114
01:04:08,242 --> 01:04:10,674
Start the car... Hurry up.

1115
01:04:22,962 --> 01:04:24,979
Feelings! ,

1116
01:04:25,086 --> 01:04:26,260
Start it up! What feelings?

1117
01:04:26,338 --> 01:04:28,556
Shut up!

1118
01:04:37,822 --> 01:04:40,004
Are you riding on a horse or starting up a car?

1119
01:04:44,643 --> 01:04:47,312
Run over him! Run over that bastard!

1120
01:04:47,496 --> 01:04:49,821
No way! That's illegal!

1121
01:05:06,984 --> 01:05:09,166
Don't run over him!

1122
01:05:39,068 --> 01:05:40,277
Are you alright. boss?!

1123
01:05:40,322 --> 01:05:40,938
I'll be going!

1124
01:05:42,897 --> 01:05:44,700
Start the car or I'll k ill you

1125
01:05:44,775 --> 01:05:46,471
Start it!

1126
01:05:57,443 --> 01:05:59,032
Brother Wai, they're here!

1127
01:06:02,628 --> 01:06:05,297
Step on the brakes. Step on it.... - You can do it!

1128
01:06:05,342 --> 01:06:06,136
What is that?

1129
01:06:06,177 --> 01:06:07,244
The brak e

1130
01:06:07,326 --> 01:06:08,429
What?

1131
01:06:08,997 --> 01:06:11,049
It's on fire!

1132
01:06:27,023 --> 01:06:28,552
Pull the hand-brak e!

1133
01:06:28,658 --> 01:06:30,390
You pull it. bro

1134
01:06:58,551 --> 01:07:00,318
Go rescues the boss!

1135
01:07:16,820 --> 01:07:19,596

01:07:21,518 --> 01:07:23,843
I heard your concert was a success

1137
01:07:23,953 --> 01:07:26,171
We've prepared you some champagne for celebration

1138
01:07:27,921 --> 01:07:30,210
Mr, Ma is back!

1139
01:07:32,828 --> 01:07:34,180
Hello, welcome!

1140
01:07:34,289 --> 01:07:37,872
Is the VlP function room ready? I'm pleased!

1141
01:07:37,943 --> 01:07:40,125
It's all ready

1142
01:07:41,771 --> 01:07:42,980
May I know who are you?

1143
01:07:43,128 --> 01:07:44,895
Yau Ma

1144
01:07:45,530 --> 01:07:47,783
Then who was that other guy?

1145
01:07:47,965 --> 01:07:49,839
Is he back  yet?

1146
01:07:49,949 --> 01:07:51,158
Who's back? - Yau Ma

1147
01:07:51,237 --> 01:07:53,740
People are all waiting for you

1148
01:07:53,777 --> 01:07:56,244
I'll go tak e a shower first, I'll be right there

1149
01:07:56,352 --> 01:07:57,976
Shower?

1150
01:08:01,015 --> 01:08:02,260
Come on in

1151
01:08:05,644 --> 01:08:09,393
You damned band boy! You got me in a huge mess

1152
01:08:09,541 --> 01:08:11,201
I almost died!

1153
01:08:11,281 --> 01:08:14,128
Whatever. we're going back to ourselves

1154
01:08:14,274 --> 01:08:17,228
You're Die-Hard and I'm Yau Ma, ok ay?

1155
01:08:17,302 --> 01:08:20,980
Hey. is there anything between you and Barbara?

1156
01:08:21,303 --> 01:08:23,628
No, of course not

1157
01:08:23,983 --> 01:08:25,857
This is my room

1158
01:08:31,429 --> 01:08:33,125
It's Tong Sum

1159
01:08:33,204 --> 01:08:35,980
Just hide upstairs for now

1160
01:08:37,450 --> 01:08:39,526
Alright, I'll leave you alone then

1161
01:08:45,001 --> 01:08:46,317
Thanks

1162
01:08:46,393 --> 01:08:47,567
Didn't you say you'll wait for me downstairs?

1163
01:08:47,681 --> 01:08:48,961
You haven't showered yet?

1164
01:08:49,073 --> 01:08:52,063
Everyone's waiting for you -Got it!

1165
01:08:52,100 --> 01:08:53,380
You go first, I'll be right there

1166
01:08:57,007 --> 01:08:57,979
What?

1167
01:08:58,086 --> 01:08:59,818
Gimme a kiss

1168
01:08:59,895 --> 01:09:02,006
Dude!

1169
01:09:02,819 --> 01:09:05,072
I'll be downstairs. waiting for you

1170
01:09:09,605 --> 01:09:11,514
Where's my purse?

1171
01:09:13,537 --> 01:09:16,134
Hey. are you alright? What are you doing?

1172
01:09:16,286 --> 01:09:18,824
Getting ready for shower? What else do you think it is?

1173
01:09:18,861 --> 01:09:20,557
It's getting complicated

1174
01:09:20,810 --> 01:09:22,957
What should we do now?

1175
01:09:23,072 --> 01:09:25,124
Tong Sum thought you were me

1176
01:09:25,438 --> 01:09:27,027
And Barbara thought I was you

1177
01:09:27,109 --> 01:09:28,662
I have no ideas what to do

1178
01:09:28,954 --> 01:09:30,863
Honestly. is Tong Sum your girl?

1179
01:09:31,006 --> 01:09:32,429
Come to think of it

1180
01:09:33,094 --> 01:09:35,905
I think I prefer Barbara

1181
01:09:36,156 --> 01:09:38,517
Barbara is Tarzan's girl

1182
01:09:39,010 --> 01:09:40,326
Don't even think  about that

1183
01:09:40,437 --> 01:09:43,948
Think about what? I don't even know this Tarzan

1184
01:09:44,996 --> 01:09:46,312
What?

1185
01:09:46,387 --> 01:09:49,020
Touching my good friend's girl is lik e touching my girl

1186
01:09:49,067 --> 01:09:50,941
You're like touching my girl, get it?

1187
01:09:51,120 --> 01:09:53,172
You touched my girl too

1188
01:09:54,635 --> 01:09:56,129
I didn't know she's your girl

1189
01:09:56,201 --> 01:09:57,861
I don't even care whose girlfriend she is

1190
01:09:58,602 --> 01:10:01,140
It's none of your business which girl I'm with

1191
01:10:01,212 --> 01:10:02,279
Say it again!

1192
01:10:02,361 --> 01:10:03,155
I can say whatever I want to say

1193
01:10:03,195 --> 01:10:04,748
What are you saying?

1194
01:10:04,866 --> 01:10:06,811
You are so rude

1195
01:10:08,555 --> 01:10:10,737
Yau Ma!

1196
01:10:14,436 --> 01:10:15,645
Are you alright

1197
01:10:15,723 --> 01:10:17,276
I'm fine

1198
01:10:19,830 --> 01:10:21,383
She's asking me, not you!

1199
01:10:21,500 --> 01:10:24,003
She tak es me as you. so I answered her

1200
01:10:24,075 --> 01:10:26,507
Who are you talk ing to?

1201
01:10:26,685 --> 01:10:29,046
What? She's my girlfriend

1202
01:10:29,086 --> 01:10:30,924
She thought she likes Yau Ma,

1203
01:10:30,966 --> 01:10:32,911
not Die-Hard!

1204
01:10:32,949 --> 01:10:36,283
Not necessarily, besides. we've already...

1205
01:10:37,995 --> 01:10:39,798
So you want her to k now that

1206
01:10:39,839 --> 01:10:41,856
she's been tricked by a fak e Yau Ma?

1207
01:10:42,449 --> 01:10:43,587
Open the door.

1208
01:10:43,702 --> 01:10:46,205
or I'll ask  someone to break  in

1209
01:10:46,277 --> 01:10:49,883
Coming  hide yourself, quick!

1210
01:10:51,323 --> 01:10:52,639
Just to mak e sure

1211
01:10:52,749 --> 01:10:54,338
Don't tak e advantage of her

1212
01:10:54,420 --> 01:10:56,044
Who's tak ing advantage of her right now?

1213
01:10:56,091 --> 01:10:58,072
If I do it, you do it too

1214
01:10:58,109 --> 01:11:00,647
What? -Use your brain to think

1215
01:11:03,572 --> 01:11:05,624
Intellectual!

1216
01:11:09,349 --> 01:11:10,973
What were you doing?

1217
01:11:11,124 --> 01:11:12,132
Are you alright?

1218
01:11:12,238 --> 01:11:13,032
I'm fine

1219
01:11:13,142 --> 01:11:15,538
Who were you talk ing to?

1220
01:11:16,901 --> 01:11:18,324
Did I trick  you?

1221
01:11:18,362 --> 01:11:20,935
No one's around, I was talking to myself

1222
01:11:20,972 --> 01:11:23,225
I'm done. Let's go

1223
01:11:29,603 --> 01:11:30,504
What are you doing?

1224
01:11:30,611 --> 01:11:33,636
You got me all wet, I need a shower too

1225
01:11:34,231 --> 01:11:36,212
Shower?

1226
01:11:38,963 --> 01:11:42,059
Excuse me. I'd lik e to tak e another one

1227
01:11:42,235 --> 01:11:45,390
it's ok ay, we'll tak e it together

1228
01:11:45,854 --> 01:11:47,728
I'm fine now

1229
01:11:47,837 --> 01:11:49,711
We did it last time

1230
01:11:49,821 --> 01:11:51,932
Did we?

1231
01:11:53,161 --> 01:11:56,767
Not only once, remember what you did

1232
01:11:56,815 --> 01:11:57,751
We'll have to do it again afterwards

1233
01:11:58,103 --> 01:12:00,012
That bastard

1234
01:12:02,906 --> 01:12:04,365
Didn't you say no

1235
01:12:04,645 --> 01:12:05,653
Why are you taking off your clothes?

1236
01:12:05,793 --> 01:12:07,322
I changed my mind according to the circumstance

1237
01:12:08,090 --> 01:12:10,071
You weirdo

1238
01:12:16,407 --> 01:12:18,518
Now you're putting your clothes back on?

1239
01:12:19,678 --> 01:12:22,311
Me? I've never taken anything off

1240
01:12:22,358 --> 01:12:23,567
No?

1241
01:12:24,898 --> 01:12:27,294
Was that a daju vu?

1242
01:12:31,510 --> 01:12:32,898
What?

1243
01:12:33,007 --> 01:12:34,015
Set up the water!

1244
01:12:34,121 --> 01:12:35,995
The water's clean

1245
01:12:36,103 --> 01:12:37,835
Didn't you shower just now?

1246
01:12:38,191 --> 01:12:39,815
Y ea I did. but...

1247
01:12:39,932 --> 01:12:42,708
I usually like to fill it up again

1248
01:12:42,750 --> 01:12:44,209
A habit,

1249
01:12:44,351 --> 01:12:47,898
I've got to get accustomed to this little habit of yours

1250
01:12:50,650 --> 01:12:52,346
I don't k now what to do

1251
01:12:52,494 --> 01:12:56,278
It's alright, I'm already all yours

1252
01:13:01,577 --> 01:13:02,786
You better not to tak e the bath

1253
01:13:02,864 --> 01:13:07,099
Otherwise we'll never finish

1254
01:13:07,145 --> 01:13:09,612
What is that?

1255
01:13:11,425 --> 01:13:14,580
Come here! We'll shower like we did back  then

1256
01:13:14,905 --> 01:13:16,637
Oh behave!

1257
01:13:17,480 --> 01:13:19,318
Stop fooling around

1258
01:13:19,359 --> 01:13:21,162
People are waiting

1259
01:13:21,413 --> 01:13:25,447
Stop it. No -it's okay

1260
01:13:29,486 --> 01:13:31,704
What's wrong? Why are you yelling at a mirror?

1261
01:13:31,748 --> 01:13:33,100
A mirror?!

1262
01:13:34,183 --> 01:13:35,677
Really?

1263
01:13:36,028 --> 01:13:37,416
Really?

1264
01:13:37,525 --> 01:13:38,984
You scared me

1265
01:13:39,090 --> 01:13:40,513
Yeah!

1266
01:13:42,918 --> 01:13:46,180
Where are you?

1267
01:13:49,530 --> 01:13:55,510
It's not a mirror. Yau, enough with the games

1268
01:13:57,916 --> 01:14:00,205
Stop fooling around

1269
01:14:04,355 --> 01:14:05,635
Hurry up!

1270
01:14:06,095 --> 01:14:07,031

1275
01:14:17,543 --> 01:14:19,132
Disgusting!

1276
01:14:19,180 --> 01:14:20,674
Crap

1277
01:14:23,564 --> 01:14:27,835
Operator... nothing. I wanna call a cab

1278
01:14:30,211 --> 01:14:32,014
What's wrong with you?

1279
01:14:32,055 --> 01:14:35,389
I just cleaned it up for you

1280
01:14:35,465 --> 01:14:38,763
You're naughty, c'mon. They're all waiting

1281
01:14:39,885 --> 01:14:41,830
Damn you!

1282
01:14:42,042 --> 01:14:44,118
What took you so long?

1283
01:14:47,680 --> 01:14:49,554
Who are you looking for?

1284
01:14:50,359 --> 01:14:51,675
I'm here for Die-Hard

1285
01:14:53,109 --> 01:14:55,185
What are you talk ing about. miss?

1286
01:14:57,215 --> 01:14:58,804
I think you've got the wrong room

1287
01:14:58,955 --> 01:15:00,307
I've been to this room before

1288
01:15:00,382 --> 01:15:01,876
He brought me in there today

1289
01:15:01,913 --> 01:15:02,600
Barbara!

1290
01:15:02,713 --> 01:15:05,109
Would you go check  if you've got the right room number?

1291
01:15:05,219 --> 01:15:06,808
Die-Hard

1292
01:15:07,133 --> 01:15:08,829
Go and hide

1293
01:15:09,430 --> 01:15:10,639
Die-Hard

1294
01:15:17,573 --> 01:15:19,376
Too shameful to see me?

1295
01:15:20,356 --> 01:15:22,159
I don't care who you're fooling around with

1296
01:15:22,897 --> 01:15:24,557
What?

1297
01:15:24,707 --> 01:15:26,996
Crazy Keung said you have to bring the briefcase

1298
01:15:27,039 --> 01:15:28,842
and see him at the Yau Lun Dock yard in an hour

1299
01:15:28,917 --> 01:15:31,170
Or else. Tarzan's dead

1300
01:15:34,172 --> 01:15:35,346
What's wrong with you?

1301
01:15:35,425 --> 01:15:37,228
You weren't like that just now

1302
01:15:37,304 --> 01:15:38,692
Why did you change all of a sudden

1303
01:15:38,800 --> 01:15:40,947
No wonder you can pay for this room

1304
01:15:40,993 --> 01:15:41,408
You must have been a gigolo

1305
01:15:41,445 --> 01:15:44,885
Hey. what are you trying to say?

1306
01:15:45,203 --> 01:15:46,863
Who is she?

1307
01:15:46,943 --> 01:15:48,437
Barbara!

1308
01:15:48,509 --> 01:15:49,825
Is she your client?

1309
01:15:49,901 --> 01:15:50,766
No!

1310
01:15:50,806 --> 01:15:55,077
I'm Tong Sum. he's my fiance

1311
01:15:55,121 --> 01:15:56,509
Fiance?

1312
01:15:56,757 --> 01:15:58,002
Barbara

1313
01:15:58,114 --> 01:15:59,667
Don't irritate me

1314
01:15:59,819 --> 01:16:02,072
Remember what you've promised me?

1315
01:16:02,150 --> 01:16:02,980
I promised 

1316
01:16:03,090 --> 01:16:05,107
People always had to give him reminders, how can he forget?

1317
01:16:05,178 --> 01:16:07,847
Why do you care so much about her?

1318
01:16:09,389 --> 01:16:12,651
Ok ay, this is crazy. I'm not sure if you two can tak e it

1319
01:16:12,799 --> 01:16:16,405
Die-Hard. Come out

1320
01:16:16,523 --> 01:16:19,228
Right now, Stop hiding.

1321
01:16:19,759 --> 01:16:22,297
He's afraid he might scare you.

1322
01:16:22,438 --> 01:16:25,011
Stop hiding! This is our only chance to explain ourselves

1323
01:16:25,779 --> 01:16:27,308
He has nowhere to go

1324
01:16:30,407 --> 01:16:31,343
We can find him for sure

1325
01:16:31,451 --> 01:16:33,740
Die-Hard. come out!

1326
01:16:34,827 --> 01:16:36,559
Not here!

1327
01:16:39,142 --> 01:16:42,096
Do I have schizophrenia?

1328
01:16:43,388 --> 01:16:47,101
It's all an illusion, There's no such person

1329
01:16:48,503 --> 01:16:50,163
The drawer 

1330
01:17:05,033 --> 01:17:07,215
Illusion?

1331
01:17:07,816 --> 01:17:09,132
Come out!

1332
01:17:10,427 --> 01:17:12,123
Really?

1333
01:17:14,846 --> 01:17:16,993
Tarzan's in trouble, you have to meet up with Crazy K,eung

1334
01:17:17,108 --> 01:17:19,125
Did she tell you where's Crazy Keung?

1335
01:17:19,336 --> 01:17:22,290
Yau Lun Dock yard... I guess

1336
01:17:22,502 --> 01:17:24,720
and bring him the briefcase

1337
01:17:24,764 --> 01:17:25,380
Look after them

1338
01:17:25,460 --> 01:17:27,156
Are you coming back?

1339
01:17:28,418 --> 01:17:30,435
I'll be back  if nothing happens to me

1340
01:17:31,655 --> 01:17:33,600
Is it that serious?

1341
01:17:37,466 --> 01:17:39,577
Whoever wants to take pictures, please proceed to the Function R oom.

1342
01:17:39,658 --> 01:17:42,196
Thank you for your cooperation...

1343
01:17:43,521 --> 01:17:45,110
Manager Chan!

1344
01:17:48,463 --> 01:17:49,992
Mr, Ma!

1345
01:17:50,098 --> 01:17:51,936
This way please 

1346
01:17:55,979 --> 01:17:58,232
Mr, Ma!

1347
01:18:01,478 --> 01:18:02,758
Die-Hard! - Mr, Ma!

1348
01:18:06,245 --> 01:18:07,525
Die-Hard

1349
01:18:08,577 --> 01:18:10,973
Since we look so much alike, we gotta be brothers

1350
01:18:11,813 --> 01:18:13,402
Life is not fair

1351
01:18:13,518 --> 01:18:14,549
But I'll tak e it

1352
01:18:14,597 --> 01:18:18,203
If I had your good background

1353
01:18:18,494 --> 01:18:20,118
I guess, I could have done just as well

1354
01:18:20,234 --> 01:18:21,966
You can die for Tarzan

1355
01:18:22,113 --> 01:18:24,924
I wish I have a brother lik e you

1356
01:18:25,037 --> 01:18:26,068
We'll go together

1357
01:18:26,115 --> 01:18:29,069
At least one of us can call for help

1358
01:18:30,431 --> 01:18:32,055
We'll have to dress the same

1359
01:19:01,227 --> 01:19:03,244
We've been waiting for you

1360
01:19:04,812 --> 01:19:06,341
May I know...

1361
01:19:06,483 --> 01:19:08,428
Be tough. this is no social gathering

1362
01:19:08,501 --> 01:19:09,853
Go!

1363
01:19:26,910 --> 01:19:28,534
So crowded!

1364
01:19:45,562 --> 01:19:47,507
Pass the briefcase over

1365
01:19:47,615 --> 01:19:49,275
Bring it over!

1366
01:19:49,320 --> 01:19:51,573
Don't move, Stay there

1367
01:19:51,861 --> 01:19:54,079
Pass the briefcase over -It's dynamite!

1368
01:19:54,192 --> 01:19:57,003
You wanna bet? It'll explode when I throw it

1369
01:19:57,115 --> 01:19:58,704
Or why do you think  I dared to come alone

1370
01:20:05,571 --> 01:20:06,401
I'm taking a piss

1371
01:20:06,477 --> 01:20:07,449
Go

1372
01:20:12,671 --> 01:20:15,340
Are the fish swimming? Breaststroke or backstrok e?

1373
01:20:29,096 --> 01:20:30,448
Where's Tarzan?

1374
01:20:30,558 --> 01:20:32,087
Close to the heaven!

1375
01:20:32,193 --> 01:20:36,156
Help, Die-Hard! Save me

1376
01:20:36,195 --> 01:20:38,069
I'm stuck to a big magnet

1377
01:20:38,318 --> 01:20:39,978
Help! 

1378
01:20:40,267 --> 01:20:43,149
Don't move, I'm scared. I'm so scared,

1379
01:20:43,259 --> 01:20:44,788
Are you Tarzan?

1380
01:20:44,895 --> 01:20:46,876
Help me, Die-Hard 

1381
01:20:47,018 --> 01:20:48,334
You hung him up so high

1382
01:20:48,375 --> 01:20:49,727
How can I be so sure that is Tarzan?

1383
01:20:50,567 --> 01:20:52,643
Let him down and you'll know

1384
01:21:01,007 --> 01:21:02,181
Is that clear enough for you?

1385
01:21:03,791 --> 01:21:05,250
When is Die-Hard going to arrive?

1386
01:21:05,322 --> 01:21:07,433
Does Ma Y au k now how to delay time?

1387
01:21:08,210 --> 01:21:10,986
Say something to prove you're T arzan

1388
01:21:11,099 --> 01:21:15,785
You bastard. you never lock  the door when you pee

1389
01:21:15,971 --> 01:21:17,703
Your farts reek more than anybody

1390
01:21:17,780 --> 01:21:19,856
Even the dog that belongs to the fat lady next door would faint

1391
01:21:20,042 --> 01:21:22,889
You pick  nose regardless And you  -Ok ay ok ay

1392
01:21:22,966 --> 01:21:24,555
Am I really like this?

01:21:26,585 --> 01:21:28,388
Alright, say something nice

1394

Which one should I pick? I'll take a wild guess!

1399
01:21:57,521 --> 01:21:59,668
Help! 

1400

Trying to trick me?

1402

01:22:30,929 --> 01:22:32,946
Stand aside

1408

How did you get down already?

1428

01:28:11,440 --> 01:28:12,934
I told you to beat him up

1493
01:28:14,781 --> 01:28:16,584
Get him!

1494
01:28:18,504 --> 01:28:20,521
I'm not telling you to let him get to you!

1495
01:28:26,786 --> 01:28:28,315
Hot  I'm burning here!

1496
01:28:28,387 --> 01:28:29,667
Why did you get merciful?

1497
01:28:29,745 --> 01:28:30,812
No!

1498
01:28:33,294 --> 01:28:35,370
Are you that useless?

1499
01:28:35,486 --> 01:28:37,075
I told you to go get him

1500
01:28:38,966 --> 01:28:40,140
Don't hit me

1501
01:28:40,184 --> 01:28:41,049
Hit you?!

1502
01:28:41,159 --> 01:28:43,104
Hit yourself

1503
01:28:44,639 --> 01:28:46,371
No! 

1504
01:28:46,587 --> 01:28:47,867
I'm gonna faint.

1505
01:28:47,944 --> 01:28:49,118
Only you?

1506
01:28:49,232 --> 01:28:51,865
Tarzan's in danger, Go help him

1507
01:28:59,498 --> 01:29:01,265
Help! 

1508
01:29:16,793 --> 01:29:18,940
Go to hell!

01:29:19,577 --> 01:29:22,317
No 

1510
01:29:23,266 --> 01:29:25,318
I didn't know I can kick  this well

1511
01:29:25,354 --> 01:29:26,777

Wow. nice. Powerful!

1518
01:29:47,903 --> 01:29:48,911
It's so hot!

1519
01:29:49,017 --> 01:29:49,740
I don't get it,

1520
01:29:49,783 --> 01:29:52,879
Why didn't you fight back until he beat you up so badly?

1521
01:29:53,228 --> 01:29:54,852
You must be k idding me Would I let him beat me to a bloody pulp?

1522
01:29:55,003 --> 01:29:57,576
Ok, I'll turn off the stove for you

1523
01:29:57,648 --> 01:29:58,786
Take your time to get him

01:30:07,773 --> 01:30:11,178
Why did it go down. Damn

1525
01:30:15,187 --> 01:30:17,298
Sorry, I got it wrong

1526
01:30:18,562 --> 01:30:20,222
What the hell, it's getting lower and lower

1527
01:30:20,337 --> 01:30:21,961
What are you doing? It's so hot!

1528
01:30:22,076 --> 01:30:24,258
Y es, it's so hot

Hurry up!

1549

Tarzan! Why are you going that way?

1550
01:31:52,728 --> 01:31:55,053

Be quick 

1554
01:32:05,848 --> 01:32:07,508
That's so fast!

1555
01:32:08,041 --> 01:32:10,437
Hey. why are you coming back  and forth?

1556
01:32:10,580 --> 01:32:14,258
You're driving me nuts. I'm not playing 

1557
01:32:15,870 --> 01:32:17,744
Hurry up!

1558
01:32:18,759 --> 01:32:20,977
Freeze!

1559
01:32:48,373 --> 01:32:49,962
Are you scared?!

1560
01:33:01,631 --> 01:33:03,327
Die-Hard...

1561
01:33:03,476 --> 01:33:05,552
Just find a place to hide and stop trying to be the hero

1562
01:33:24,668 --> 01:33:26,056
There he is!

1563
01:33:26,165 --> 01:33:27,754
Get him down!

1564
01:33:39,632 --> 01:33:41,328
Go to hell!

1565
01:33:41,442 --> 01:33:42,473
I'll keep that in mind!

1566
01:33:42,973 --> 01:33:44,467
Hurry up!

1567
01:33:44,574 --> 01:33:46,555
Don't run!

1568
01:33:46,662 --> 01:33:48,679
Shit, where's the phone?

1569
01:33:49,481 --> 01:33:52,399
Crap! See? I told you that it's safest to stay in the car

1570
01:34:05,035 --> 01:34:06,173
Go!

1571
01:34:06,289 --> 01:34:07,949
What a big crowd. Guaranteed victory here!

1572
01:34:31,657 --> 01:34:32,973
Over there,

1573
01:34:33,050 --> 01:34:34,746
Run! Chase after 'em!

1574
01:35:07,118 --> 01:35:08,612
Go!

1575
01:35:08,962 --> 01:35:10,456
Hurry up!

1576
01:35:10,563 --> 01:35:11,630
Yes!

1577
01:35:11,746 --> 01:35:13,620
Over there! Go...

1578
01:35:40,177 --> 01:35:40,936
I'll go first,

1579
01:35:41,013 --> 01:35:41,843
I'll go first

1580
01:35:41,952 --> 01:35:45,107
You're going?! The hell with you!

1581
01:35:53,018 --> 01:35:54,298
Go!

1582
01:35:57,333 --> 01:35:58,792
He can fly?

1583
01:36:05,754 --> 01:36:07,070
Tarzan?

1584
01:36:07,112 --> 01:36:08,084
Tarzan?

1585
01:36:14,210 --> 01:36:15,870
Go or we're dead,

1586
01:36:17,969 --> 01:36:19,736
Run. Die-Hard!

1587
01:36:27,678 --> 01:36:29,695
Tarzan!

1588
01:36:32,098 --> 01:36:35,052
Tarzan... Tarzan...

1589
01:36:35,160 --> 01:36:36,927
100km per hour

1590
01:36:37,039 --> 01:36:41,725
Seat belts on and the passenger shall be fine

1591
01:36:43,024 --> 01:36:44,091
Are you alright?

1592
01:36:44,208 --> 01:36:47,613
I've got my seat belt on  I'm fine!

1593
01:36:49,045 --> 01:36:51,298
You and I are going to fight and see who's better

1594
01:36:51,376 --> 01:36:54,045
I can't. Wai, you go and fight him,

1595
01:36:54,334 --> 01:36:56,552
Do you really need to go this far?

1596
01:36:56,875 --> 01:36:58,013
Go!

1597
01:37:07,419 --> 01:37:09,151
Weapons?

1598
01:37:22,974 --> 01:37:25,512
Just run! I'll see just how far you can run

1599
01:37:27,185 --> 01:37:29,237
Die-Hard. where are you?

1600
01:37:31,152 --> 01:37:32,705
It's block ed

1601
01:37:39,295 --> 01:37:40,884
There's two of them

1602
01:37:40,966 --> 01:37:42,804
One can fight. one can't

1603
01:37:42,948 --> 01:37:45,380
This one can fight or not? - What do you think?

1604
01:37:46,220 --> 01:37:47,987
He's a fighter

1605
01:38:15,973 --> 01:38:18,049
Wai, he's not Die-Hard, He's someone else

1606
01:38:18,131 --> 01:38:20,634
Dare to fight me?

1607
01:38:25,717 --> 01:38:28,707
Wai, fight me if you have guts,

1608
01:38:34,696 --> 01:38:35,727
Dodge!

1609
01:38:37,131 --> 01:38:38,234
Dodge!

1610
01:38:39,289 --> 01:38:40,498
Dodge!

1611
01:38:55,297 --> 01:38:58,179
The feeling's here, Get him 

1612
01:39:00,587 --> 01:39:03,398
Hit him, turn around and hit him hard

1613
01:39:09,808 --> 01:39:12,346
Kick.. Kick him...

1614
01:39:13,045 --> 01:39:15,156
Kick, not that side, the other side

1615
01:39:16,315 --> 01:39:17,809
Like this

1616
01:39:21,014 --> 01:39:23,339
Get him down!

1617
01:39:30,792 --> 01:39:33,188
Not me!

1618
01:39:33,541 --> 01:39:36,732
They're both fighters

1619
01:39:42,659 --> 01:39:45,649
Hey. open the door

1620
01:39:51,428 --> 01:39:54,275
Can you tell me who I am?

1621
01:39:54,490 --> 01:39:56,851
You're Y au Ma. who else do you think  you are?

1622
01:39:56,962 --> 01:39:59,844
I'm Yau Ma? But how come I can fight?

1623
01:39:59,954 --> 01:40:03,465
Just shut up and open the door. Open the door!

1624
01:40:07,436 --> 01:40:08,503
Where's Tarzan?

1625
01:40:08,654 --> 01:40:10,350
Should be in the car

1626
01:40:12,656 --> 01:40:14,803
Freeze!

1627
01:40:16,345 --> 01:40:18,942
Two of them? - One

1628
01:40:18,990 --> 01:40:21,101
One?! - You've got blurred vision!

1629
01:40:21,146 --> 01:40:22,355
Blurred?

1630
01:40:25,949 --> 01:40:29,283
Really? Squat down!

1631
01:40:30,438 --> 01:40:32,027
There's two of them!

1632
01:40:41,817 --> 01:40:43,346
Yau Ma!

1633
01:40:45,193 --> 01:40:47,518
Where? Where's the seat belt?

1634
01:40:55,493 --> 01:40:57,889
300km per hour

1635
01:40:58,034 --> 01:41:00,110
passengers don't have their seat belts on

1636
01:41:00,156 --> 01:41:03,217
Sorry! You're sure to die!

1637
01:41:12,475 --> 01:41:14,586
The flower's so fine -Thank you

1638
01:41:20,932 --> 01:41:23,364
What is tak ing him so long to arrive?

1639
01:41:23,472 --> 01:41:25,904
I'm longing to see the resemblance of Yau

1640
01:41:26,013 --> 01:41:27,436
I wish he's our son

1641
01:41:27,544 --> 01:41:29,168
Yes, I wish that too

1642
01:41:29,283 --> 01:41:31,916
But you should remain calm and avoid fainting

1643
01:41:31,998 --> 01:41:32,899
Got it!

1644
01:41:32,938 --> 01:41:36,058
Dad. Mom still haven't seen Die-Hard

1645
01:41:36,174 --> 01:41:37,383
I wonder where he's gone to

1646
01:41:42,959 --> 01:41:45,141
Mr, Ma, this is a letter for you.

1647
01:41:45,500 --> 01:41:47,374
Congratulations, Mr. And Mrs, Ma

1648
01:41:47,484 --> 01:41:48,515
Thanks so much

1649
01:41:48,632 --> 01:41:50,328
You two should take a rest

1650
01:41:50,407 --> 01:41:52,459
I'll be right over -Sure...

1651
01:41:53,226 --> 01:41:55,278
Die-Hard wrote this letter and left it for me

1652
01:41:55,697 --> 01:41:59,338
I'd never thought I'll have my family this soon

1653
01:41:59,490 --> 01:42:02,824
This is way too challenging for me

1654
01:42:02,935 --> 01:42:04,844
So I'm gonna hold it up for a bit

1655
01:42:04,919 --> 01:42:06,615
Take care of those two girls

1656
01:42:06,762 --> 01:42:08,291
I'm handing them over to you

1657
01:42:08,329 --> 01:42:09,360
See you later!

1658
01:42:11,669 --> 01:42:12,914
Dad and Mom

1659
01:42:13,096 --> 01:42:14,625
I think we have to cancel the wedding

1660
01:42:15,601 --> 01:42:16,810
Cancel?!

1661
01:42:16,889 --> 01:42:18,383
I'm going to go look for Die-Hard

1662
01:42:21,482 --> 01:42:22,513
Yau Ma!

1663
01:42:22,562 --> 01:42:24,115
Over there

1664
01:42:24,336 --> 01:42:25,795
Yau - Mr. Ma...

1665
01:42:25,867 --> 01:42:27,290
Yau - Mr. Ma...

1666
01:42:27,364 --> 01:42:28,431
Yau Ma!

1667
01:42:29,904 --> 01:42:30,935
Die-Hard

1668
01:42:31,052 --> 01:42:32,155
Yau Ma!

1669
01:42:32,271 --> 01:42:33,172
Where are you going?

1670
01:42:34,010 --> 01:42:35,398
You've brought a lot of people out here

1671
01:42:35,890 --> 01:42:37,443
Big twin, little twin

1672
01:42:37,560 --> 01:42:39,292
Don't faint!

1673
01:42:40,310 --> 01:42:42,563
Dad! Dad!

1674
01:42:42,885 --> 01:42:44,059
Now what?

1675
01:42:44,137 --> 01:42:45,311
Of course, we run!

1676
01:42:47,235 --> 01:42:48,788
They're gone,

1677
01:42:51,932 --> 01:42:52,797
Die-Hard!

1678
01:42:53,010 --> 01:42:54,077
Yau Ma!

1679
01:42:54,194 --> 01:42:56,590
Don't run! Come back!

1680
01:42:59,623 --> 01:43:01,461
They're completely identical

1681
01:43:01,606 --> 01:43:04,488
You're Die-Hard? You're Yau Ma?

1682
01:43:06,409 --> 01:43:08,318
Who is who?

1683
01:43:11,838 --> 01:43:13,498
It's you!

1684
01:43:18,480 --> 01:43:20,243
What should we do now?

1685
01:43:20,348 --> 01:43:21,940
Just grab one

1686
01:43:22,050 --> 01:43:22,880
Sure!

1687
01:43:22,951 --> 01:43:24,384
That'll do?
