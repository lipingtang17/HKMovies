3
00:00:26,976 --> 00:00:28,568
Mr. Lee

4
00:00:28,812 --> 00:00:30,370
Crystal called you twice this morning

5
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:32,179
and asked you to return her call

6
00:00:32,415 --> 00:00:34,280
Mr. Albert from London, Mr. Kay from
New York

7
00:00:34,317 --> 00:00:36,615
and Mr. Short from Geneva would like
to have a conference with you

8
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,212
shall l call them now?

9
00:00:39,756 --> 00:00:40,381
Daniel

10
00:00:41,424 --> 00:00:43,051
l know, the market has slide down over
400 points

11
00:00:43,326 --> 00:00:44,122
Sell all of 2137

12
00:00:44,427 --> 00:00:44,984
2137?

13
00:00:45,161 --> 00:00:45,991
Yes, 2137

14
00:00:46,596 --> 00:00:48,325
Mr. Lee, don't forget to call Crystal

15
00:00:48,398 --> 00:00:48,887
Got it

16
00:00:49,132 --> 00:00:50,656
Although the South East Asian Financial
crisis

17
00:00:50,934 --> 00:00:52,367
seems to be extending

18
00:00:52,502 --> 00:00:54,299
l don't think it will affect Hong Kong

19
00:00:54,604 --> 00:00:55,263
Shit

20
00:00:57,307 --> 00:00:59,969
l've tried to reach you for three days
the stock declined over 500 points

21
00:01:00,043 --> 00:01:01,067
and you're here fiddling your shoes?

22
00:01:02,979 --> 00:01:04,037
What can l do?

23
00:01:04,314 --> 00:01:06,179
l believe that HK won't be affected

24
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:10,918
we have a foreign exchange reserve of
90 billion US dollars

25
00:01:10,987 --> 00:01:12,284
we're world's number three

26
00:01:12,655 --> 00:01:15,021
Of course you are going to be
the Asian Sores

27
00:01:18,261 --> 00:01:18,955
Sores

28
00:01:20,363 --> 00:01:21,330
Sores?

29
00:01:22,198 --> 00:01:24,132
No thanks, l'll leave that for your dad

30
00:01:24,868 --> 00:01:26,631
Me? l just want to hold his daughter

31
00:01:28,037 --> 00:01:30,335
You're a Nobody and you want me to
marry you?

32
00:01:32,742 --> 00:01:36,143
We are World's third in terms of
foreign exchange reserve

33
00:01:36,379 --> 00:01:37,846
we have over 90 billion US dollars

34
00:01:38,448 --> 00:01:40,643
we have a very healthy economic
structure

35
00:01:41,317 --> 00:01:43,842
moreover, we have the full backup of
the China market.

36
00:01:44,487 --> 00:01:45,784
l'm worried that the drop will affect our

37
00:01:45,822 --> 00:01:47,585
investments in South East Asia

38
00:01:48,725 --> 00:01:49,919
l understand, Mr. Albert,

39
00:01:50,627 --> 00:01:52,254
but l can guarantee that everything will
be fine

40
00:01:52,529 --> 00:01:54,019
Then l have to trust you, but if/.,;'/.,;'/.,;'

41
00:01:55,165 --> 00:01:56,655
Excuse me, please hold on

42
00:01:57,967 --> 00:02:00,697
The morning market will be closed
in 15 minutes

43
00:02:01,104 --> 00:02:02,537
but it has declined 713 points already

44
00:02:03,173 --> 00:02:05,664
and with the full backup from
the China market

45
00:02:06,209 --> 00:02:07,369
Clear all of 3006

46
00:02:07,844 --> 00:02:10,540
Because we have 90 billion US dollars
as foreign exchange reserve

47
00:02:11,447 --> 00:02:13,278
The Government won't let the market fall
any further

48
00:02:14,417 --> 00:02:15,611
Let's hold on for a while

49
00:02:16,252 --> 00:02:17,219
we shall be able to sell once there's
a profit margin

50
00:02:18,388 --> 00:02:20,754
Buy 3005 for all of my accounts

51
00:02:22,992 --> 00:02:24,550
What are you thinking? Come on! Go!

52
00:02:28,431 --> 00:02:29,921
The Commissioner of Finance once

53
00:02:30,066 --> 00:02:33,729
mentioned that the crash would probably
be over around Christmas

54
00:02:33,970 --> 00:02:36,404
By that time, l believe the Hang Seng

55
00:02:36,639 --> 00:02:38,800
lndex will re-bounce to the level of
18,000 points

56
00:03:15,111 --> 00:03:18,638
We lost fifty million dollars

57
00:05:12,595 --> 00:05:14,187
There's nothing to live for/.,;'/.,;'/.,;'

58
00:05:17,333 --> 00:05:18,630
l agree

59
00:05:19,669 --> 00:05:22,797
l wish that someone rich will take care of
this baby

60
00:05:27,777 --> 00:05:28,835
Your mom must be crazy

61
00:05:30,613 --> 00:05:32,581
How would someone rich adopt you?

62
00:06:42,452 --> 00:06:43,282
The baby!

63
00:06:54,630 --> 00:06:55,756
l'm sorry

64
00:06:59,135 --> 00:06:59,863
ls he all right?

65
00:07:00,470 --> 00:07:01,368
Not very good

66
00:07:02,038 --> 00:07:03,505
His body temperature and blood
pressure are very low

67
00:07:04,507 --> 00:07:05,474
How can you be so careless?

68
00:07:05,775 --> 00:07:06,673
Adopting a child?

69
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:08,572
So you've already cleared up the mess
in the company?

70
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:11,943
Just picked up a baby back and be his
adopted father?

71
00:08:16,546 --> 00:08:18,104
Wanna check your blood pressure, Miss

72
00:08:19,015 --> 00:08:19,811
lt's free

73
00:08:21,317 --> 00:08:22,045
Next time then

74
00:08:28,958 --> 00:08:32,018
Ming, You come to see me?

75
00:08:32,962 --> 00:08:33,792
Ming

76
00:08:40,469 --> 00:08:43,438
Ming, l'm going to treat you and Wing
with dessert tonight

77
00:08:44,006 --> 00:08:44,904
You want to take advantage of him again

78
00:08:45,575 --> 00:08:46,371
What advantage?

79
00:08:47,210 --> 00:08:50,338
Wing said you always take advantage
of others

80
00:08:52,882 --> 00:08:55,373
But l'm making your favorite green bean
dessert

81
00:08:55,618 --> 00:08:56,243
Don't you like it?

82
00:08:57,019 --> 00:08:57,542
l like

83
00:08:57,954 --> 00:09:00,286
So you'll bring Wing with you tonight
for dessert, OK

84
00:09:00,523 --> 00:09:00,852
OK

85
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:01,554
See you then

86
00:09:01,757 --> 00:09:02,052
Bye

87
00:09:02,892 --> 00:09:03,551
Watch your steps

88
00:09:03,726 --> 00:09:04,124
OK

89
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:12,130
Lan, didn't l tell you not to set
your stall here?

90
00:09:12,668 --> 00:09:14,101
They can charge you on blocking
the road

91
00:09:15,605 --> 00:09:20,099
Sir Lung, You don't go and warn those
money-making stalls at the back

92
00:09:20,643 --> 00:09:22,167
but to complain about me who is doing
free social services?

93
00:09:22,812 --> 00:09:26,248
The Hawker's Control Team will take
care of them

94
00:09:27,116 --> 00:09:30,950
but affecting road order is my
responsibility, don't you see?

95
00:09:32,722 --> 00:09:33,848
Just in case some stupid guy drives a

96
00:09:33,889 --> 00:09:35,652
vehicle down and hit you

97
00:09:35,725 --> 00:09:37,955
l can't bear that responsibility if anything
happens to you

98
00:09:38,594 --> 00:09:40,824
You spooky mouth! Who would want
you to be responsible?

99
00:09:41,797 --> 00:09:44,561
l don't mean that, just move a hit

100
00:09:47,069 --> 00:09:49,902
Ming, Come and touch my mahjong for
luck

101
00:09:51,674 --> 00:09:52,606
Where's Wing?

102
00:09:53,175 --> 00:09:55,200
He's not back yet, just wait for a while

103
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:01,976
Want a popsicle, Ming

104
00:10:02,385 --> 00:10:03,784
No, Thank you

105
00:10:05,021 --> 00:10:05,817
No, thank you

106
00:10:07,857 --> 00:10:08,585
Put this back for me

107
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:11,217
Go and play

108
00:10:15,298 --> 00:10:17,789
ls it really so difficult for a fresh grad to
get a job now?

109
00:10:20,636 --> 00:10:22,797
lt's no good to have our neighbors
seeing you.

110
00:10:23,139 --> 00:10:24,436
sitting here all day doing nothing

111
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:25,871
Get a job

112
00:10:26,108 --> 00:10:28,099
lt's not that difficult to get a job, sister

113
00:10:29,078 --> 00:10:31,546
but it's hard to find a job which you
really enjoy

114
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:32,740
don't you understand?

115
00:10:33,282 --> 00:10:35,341
What do you like to do? l'll help you

116
00:10:37,486 --> 00:10:38,612
Wing is back

117
00:10:40,589 --> 00:10:41,715
Let's eat

118
00:10:44,493 --> 00:10:45,187
You're not finishing this round?

119
00:10:45,728 --> 00:10:46,524
Thanks

120
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:48,389
Let me help you

121
00:10:48,664 --> 00:10:49,392
How's your luck today?

122
00:10:49,565 --> 00:10:51,055
lt's too late, my pockets are emptied
already

123
00:10:51,901 --> 00:10:52,663
Take it easy, man

124
00:10:52,868 --> 00:10:53,425
l'm leaving

125
00:10:53,536 --> 00:10:53,900
Bye

126
00:10:56,906 --> 00:10:57,736
Fatty

127
00:10:58,708 --> 00:10:59,367
Wing

128
00:11:00,943 --> 00:11:04,140
Lan asked us to go over to have dessert
tonight

129
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:06,273
Really? She wants to take advantage
of me again?

130
00:11:06,682 --> 00:11:08,047
This is what l told her too

131
00:11:08,517 --> 00:11:10,610
Did you really say that?

132
00:11:35,111 --> 00:11:35,907
Done

133
00:11:36,645 --> 00:11:38,977
Wing, please fix those hanging hooks
in the kitchen too

134
00:11:39,548 --> 00:11:40,537
Didn't you fix them yesterday?

135
00:11:41,384 --> 00:11:42,442
You did! They're so useful

136
00:11:42,718 --> 00:11:44,345
So l bought three more today, thanks

137
00:11:45,121 --> 00:11:47,351
This one is for Chuen, go and get your
own in the kitchen

138
00:11:47,556 --> 00:11:48,488
O.K. l'll help himself

139
00:12:03,806 --> 00:12:04,431
Sir Lung?

140
00:12:05,608 --> 00:12:06,267
l'm sorry

141
00:12:06,609 --> 00:12:08,509
but your boxes outside blocked the fire
exit

142
00:12:09,478 --> 00:12:11,912
l thought these are concerns of the
Fire Department

143
00:12:13,015 --> 00:12:14,915
Well, in case of any accident, it will be
too late

144
00:12:16,385 --> 00:12:18,046
When l'm out on the road, you said
l'm blocking the road

145
00:12:18,387 --> 00:12:20,355
when l'm home, you said l'm blocking
the fire exit

146
00:12:20,890 --> 00:12:21,857
Are you picking on me

147
00:12:22,391 --> 00:12:23,085
lt's nothing like that

148
00:12:23,592 --> 00:12:24,422
The new Fire Ordinance

149
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:26,758
it's illegal to block the fire exit

150
00:12:27,530 --> 00:12:29,555
And besides, so many elderly living at
your place

151
00:12:29,732 --> 00:12:30,994
if the Fire Department discovers this

152
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:33,198
they'll charge you on illegal running an
elderly home

153
00:12:34,370 --> 00:12:36,201
l'll help you to bring them in

154
00:12:36,439 --> 00:12:37,804
No thanks, l'll do it myself

155
00:12:38,174 --> 00:12:40,574
Want some dessert?

156
00:12:41,043 --> 00:12:43,409
lt's all finished, l didn't expect you

157
00:12:44,747 --> 00:12:45,372
Next time then

158
00:12:46,115 --> 00:12:46,581
Jogging?

159
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:47,774
Keeping fit

160
00:12:48,951 --> 00:12:49,440
Next time then

161
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:58,854
l'm teaching you this today: No problem

162
00:12:59,395 --> 00:13:02,592
No, problem, low/.,;'/.,;'/.,;' paul/.,;'/.,;'/.,;' pump

163
00:13:04,099 --> 00:13:05,066
What is no problem?

164
00:13:08,504 --> 00:13:09,528
OK

165
00:13:10,272 --> 00:13:14,402
l'll teach you another phrase: no good

166
00:13:50,412 --> 00:13:52,676
Don't stay so close to the TV, it's bad
for your eyes

167
00:13:53,482 --> 00:13:54,449
Come, let's sit here

168
00:13:57,286 --> 00:13:58,719
Tell me what you are watching?

169
00:13:58,787 --> 00:14:00,755
l hereby on behalf of the committee of
the Children's Hope Project

170

the kind donors

172
00:14:06,729 --> 00:14:08,754
this Charity show in Hong Kong

173
00:14:09,231 --> 00:14:11,756
which reminds me that our organization

174
00:14:11,901 --> 00:14:15,428
might have neglected a lot of friends
around us

175
00:14:16,038 --> 00:14:18,268
l would like to take this opportunity

176
00:14:18,741 --> 00:14:22,575
on behalf of my former husband's
organization

177
00:14:22,912 --> 00:14:24,470
donate 100 million Hong Kong dollars

178
00:14:24,847 --> 00:14:28,010
to help those in need in Hong Kong

179
00:14:28,517 --> 00:14:31,645
We'll consider any kind of proposals

180
00:14:31,987 --> 00:14:32,544

We'll see, OK

199
00:15:08,591 --> 00:15:10,422
No problem, of course work comes first

200
00:15:10,859 --> 00:15:12,258
we can arrange in the future

201
00:15:12,394 --> 00:15:14,658
l should leave you to rest now, good-bye

202
00:15:14,697 --> 00:15:15,686

203
00:15:16,899 --> 00:15:21,563
Welcome Mrs. Leung! Welcome

204
00:15:21,804 --> 00:15:22,793
Don't

205
00:15:23,539 --> 00:15:24,267
Please go out

206
00:15:24,473 --> 00:15:25,462
Mrs. Leung is tired

207
00:15:25,808 --> 00:15:27,400
Please go away

208
00:15:29,378 --> 00:15:30,675
Please

209
00:15:39,088 --> 00:15:40,316
Are you all right? Mrs. Leung?

210
00:15:45,594 --> 00:15:49,121
Mrs. Leung, let's go out for dinner,
and relax/.,;'/.,;'/.,;'

211
00:15:52,134 --> 00:15:53,761
l don't want to go anywhere

212
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:56,031
l just want to go back Hong Kong
tomorrow morning

213
00:15:56,205 --> 00:15:56,967
You want to see Dr. Chung?

214
00:15:57,306 --> 00:15:58,068
l'll arrange an appointment

215
00:16:06,148 --> 00:16:08,048
Or, do you want to try other doctors?

216
00:16:09,885 --> 00:16:11,853
l think l'll be scared of children for the
rest of my life

217
00:16:12,121 --> 00:16:13,088
Whatever l do is useless

218
00:16:14,089 --> 00:16:17,718
lt's very difficult for me to mix with kids

219
00:16:19,495 --> 00:16:20,826
Don't feel so bad

220
00:16:21,797 --> 00:16:22,627
Things may get better

221
00:16:25,467 --> 00:16:26,024
Thank you

222
00:16:27,269 --> 00:16:28,736
You go back and rest now, l'm fine

223
00:16:29,171 --> 00:16:30,433
Don't stay up too late then

224
00:17:44,813 --> 00:17:46,303
We can have a bigger sitting area here

225
00:17:46,749 --> 00:17:47,477
if l knock down the room at the back

226
00:17:47,950 --> 00:17:48,644
Knock down that room?

227
00:17:49,218 --> 00:17:49,946
Wing, take this

228
00:17:52,488 --> 00:17:53,045
Here?

229
00:17:53,188 --> 00:17:53,654
Okay

230
00:17:53,956 --> 00:17:55,082
Are you sure?

231
00:17:55,858 --> 00:17:57,450
You said there's lot of stuff left from your

232
00:17:57,626 --> 00:17:58,217
husband inside there

233
00:17:58,494 --> 00:18:00,359
and you wanna knock the room down

234
00:18:00,395 --> 00:18:00,952
if not, there won't be enough space for
the children's home

235
00:18:01,029 --> 00:18:01,620
Ten and a half feet

236
00:18:03,098 --> 00:18:06,192
Ten and a half times twelve feet should
be big enough

237
00:18:06,235 --> 00:18:07,133
Think twice

238
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:09,059
No need

239
00:18:09,805 --> 00:18:12,774
These two years, the elderly has gone
one by one

240
00:18:13,809 --> 00:18:15,936
most of them have gone to 'the other side
of the world''

241
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:20,771
This neighborhood has a lot of children
wandering around

242
00:18:21,316 --> 00:18:22,806
a children's home can take care of them

243
00:18:25,654 --> 00:18:28,851
Over, Over! Ming forgets his clothes

244
00:18:30,259 --> 00:18:33,319
Over, Over! Ming forgets his clothes

245
00:18:34,096 --> 00:18:35,222
Are you there? Wing?

246
00:18:35,397 --> 00:18:36,455
l don't know where your clothes are

247
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:37,493
go get yourself

248
00:18:38,901 --> 00:18:42,337
Wing! He's still a baby, you asked him
to get it himself?

249
00:18:43,005 --> 00:18:44,336
He's four and still a baby?

250
00:18:44,873 --> 00:18:46,170
Then l'm thirty something baby

251
00:18:46,341 --> 00:18:47,433
How can you ask me to do so much?

252
00:18:48,610 --> 00:18:49,508
Wing! Come over! Wing

253
00:18:50,112 --> 00:18:50,635
Now what?

254
00:18:50,813 --> 00:18:53,304
Hold this for me, l want to measure this
area

255
00:18:56,885 --> 00:18:57,476
5 feet

256
00:18:57,719 --> 00:18:58,913
You're not wearing your slippers again

257
00:18:59,955 --> 00:19:02,116
Your feet will looks like frog's feet when
you grow up

258
00:19:03,659 --> 00:19:06,958
Wing! l want to build a wall downstairs

259
00:19:07,563 --> 00:19:09,053
to separate the elderly and the children's
home

260
00:19:09,231 --> 00:19:09,629
Good

261
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:13,063
And here, will be the children's bathroom

262
00:19:15,204 --> 00:19:15,863
Here?!

263
00:19:16,205 --> 00:19:17,194
l'll get it! l'll get it

264
00:19:17,973 --> 00:19:18,564
You go then

265
00:19:18,874 --> 00:19:20,034
Let's move on, Lan, what else?

266
00:19:20,442 --> 00:19:22,376
You're still not wearing your slippers

267
00:19:23,145 --> 00:19:25,204
l know, l know

268
00:19:26,014 --> 00:19:26,946
So why don't you buy me more

269
00:19:30,919 --> 00:19:32,614

l'm playing with him

292
00:20:45,994 --> 00:20:47,586
You're only a four years old baby

293
00:20:47,863 --> 00:20:48,887
and you're not ready for this

294

00:20:59,074 --> 00:21:00,473
Only Ming and do it

So comfy

297
00:21:27,669 --> 00:21:30,035
Wing, l want to buy a popsicle

298
00:21:33,175 --> 00:21:33,766
You're thirsty

Hey, You're looking for someone?

Are you that lady on TV?

303

You're in the wrong place, please go!

304

No

312
00:23:09,704 --> 00:23:10,568
What's your name?

313
00:23:10,806 --> 00:23:11,864
Ming, four years old

314
00:23:12,574 --> 00:23:13,598
You were with your mother?

315

Hey kid! Why are you here?

Mrs. Leung, are you Ok

319
00:23:25,821 --> 00:23:27,448
How can they just have these kids
wandering around

320
00:23:36,331 --> 00:23:38,856
You, did you make a mess at the boat?

321
00:23:39,468 --> 00:23:40,127
No

322
00:23:40,635 --> 00:23:41,761
l know you won't tell me

323
00:23:43,105 --> 00:23:44,197
but if you'll do this again

324
00:23:44,473 --> 00:23:46,703
You'll not only hurt your hand but your
foot as well

325
00:23:48,810 --> 00:23:51,711
OK! Done

326
00:23:53,648 --> 00:23:54,342
What's that?

327
00:23:57,986 --> 00:23:59,851
You took advantage of me again

328
00:24:00,021 --> 00:24:00,885
The fish is mine

329
00:24:01,356 --> 00:24:04,257
You're right! Just to remind you not to
trust people so easily

330
00:24:04,893 --> 00:24:05,587
Have a bit more

331
00:24:08,730 --> 00:24:09,219
You're full?

332
00:24:09,664 --> 00:24:10,130
Full

333
00:24:10,565 --> 00:24:13,728
Full! Ok, now wipe your mouth!
go to sleep

334
00:24:16,771 --> 00:24:18,762
Go ahead, l'll still got work to do

335
00:24:20,242 --> 00:24:20,867
What?

336
00:24:22,777 --> 00:24:23,709
Again

337
00:24:27,415 --> 00:24:29,940
OK, just two phrases

338
00:25:16,164 --> 00:25:17,290
This one's better! This one

339
00:25:18,466 --> 00:25:19,057
Thank you

340
00:25:20,969 --> 00:25:22,334
Sir Lung

341
00:25:22,938 --> 00:25:24,200
lt's raining like shit, come on over

342
00:25:30,078 --> 00:25:30,601
Ming

343
00:25:33,081 --> 00:25:33,809
This grumpy rain

344
00:25:34,282 --> 00:25:36,011
You look busy today, running back and
forth

345
00:25:38,186 --> 00:25:41,587
lf you sell umbrellas here, people will
complaint

346
00:25:42,691 --> 00:25:44,420
You've been working with the Hawkers'
Control Team

347
00:25:45,093 --> 00:25:46,287
l'm responsible for maintaining road
order

348
00:25:47,229 --> 00:25:48,196
Just in case someone stupid drives

349
00:25:48,230 --> 00:25:49,788
a vehicle down and hit you

350
00:25:49,831 --> 00:25:51,924
l can't take the responsibility

351
00:25:52,133 --> 00:25:53,327
OK/.,;'/.,;'/.,;'

352
00:25:55,904 --> 00:25:58,964
l'm not asking you to leave, just be
careful

353
00:26:00,408 --> 00:26:01,067
l will

354
00:26:01,176 --> 00:26:01,608
Hey, Wing

355
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:02,242
What?

356
00:26:02,377 --> 00:26:04,436
Why aren't Lan measuring people's
blood pressure these few days?

357
00:26:05,113 --> 00:26:07,946
She's sick! Why don't you go and
see her?

358
00:26:08,984 --> 00:26:09,712
lt's not serious, is it?

359
00:26:10,485 --> 00:26:11,349
Quite

360
00:26:13,188 --> 00:26:14,348
lt's just that l didn't see her around

361
00:26:15,624 --> 00:26:16,556
Got to go and work

362
00:26:18,426 --> 00:26:19,358
Go and see her

363
00:26:20,829 --> 00:26:21,796
Send my regards to Lan

364
00:26:22,130 --> 00:26:22,687
All right!

365
00:26:24,299 --> 00:26:26,460
Lan is ill, you go and see her

366
00:26:26,501 --> 00:26:28,128
l know, Ming, good boy

367
00:26:31,439 --> 00:26:33,907
Watch the umbrellas, let's have fun/.,;'/.,;'/.,;'

368
00:26:34,075 --> 00:26:34,666
Let me do it

369
00:26:39,981 --> 00:26:40,811
See

370
00:26:41,049 --> 00:26:41,947
Umbrellas

371
00:26:51,226 --> 00:26:53,956
l thought giving my child to someone rich

372
00:26:54,596 --> 00:26:56,530
he'll be happier

373
00:26:57,198 --> 00:26:58,529
and then l can start all over again

374
00:27:00,402 --> 00:27:01,460
but finally understand that

375
00:27:02,570 --> 00:27:06,939
losing someone close is even more
painful than being poor

376
00:27:08,543 --> 00:27:10,272
l've tried very hard

377
00:27:11,479 --> 00:27:12,741
and l still can't find my own child

378
00:27:14,683 --> 00:27:16,617
and then l got this fear

379
00:27:16,651 --> 00:27:17,879
l can't get close to kids

380
00:27:19,187 --> 00:27:20,085
but, it's strange

381
00:27:20,989 --> 00:27:22,183
l'm not afraid of Ming

382
00:27:23,391 --> 00:27:25,188
l was a bit scare at the very beginning

383
00:27:26,227 --> 00:27:27,717
but then afterwards, l'm fine

384
00:27:28,763 --> 00:27:32,665
maybe it's because l was helping with
his wounds, distracted

385
00:27:33,735 --> 00:27:35,760
l think it's a good start

386
00:27:36,304 --> 00:27:38,397
you begin to open up yourself to others

387
00:27:38,573 --> 00:27:40,473
not only children, but other people
as well

388
00:27:40,842 --> 00:27:42,434
l believe this is the only way that

389
00:27:42,744 --> 00:27:44,075
can heal your psychological fear

390
00:27:44,913 --> 00:27:45,880
l've got something for you

391
00:27:47,048 --> 00:27:47,878
New medication

392
00:27:48,016 --> 00:27:48,482
No

393
00:27:49,718 --> 00:27:53,950
l've brought this movie for you,
a children movie

394
00:27:54,089 --> 00:27:55,283
you'll watch it before you go to sleep
tonight

395
00:27:55,790 --> 00:27:58,816
and you'll let me know in the morning

396
00:27:59,227 --> 00:28:01,161
Whether you can sleep or not, or
nightmare? OK

397
00:28:01,796 --> 00:28:02,421
Thank you

398
00:28:03,932 --> 00:28:04,626
l'm leaving now

399
00:28:05,166 --> 00:28:05,757
l'll see you to the door

400
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:06,357
Thanks

401
00:28:09,804 --> 00:28:10,896
Thank you, Doctor Jones

402
00:28:11,706 --> 00:28:14,504
Oh yes, you have been torturing yourself
for four years

403
00:28:15,210 --> 00:28:16,768
Whatever you have done wrong in

404
00:28:17,078 --> 00:28:18,102
the past, should more or less be justified

405
00:28:18,513 --> 00:28:20,003
Take care, good-bye

406
00:28:39,367 --> 00:28:41,301
Mrs. Leung, we've received eight
proposals today

407
00:28:41,636 --> 00:28:43,160
This one is quite interesting, take a look

408
00:28:48,443 --> 00:28:50,070
Changing a elderly home to children's
home?

409
00:28:52,614 --> 00:28:54,172
Playing with fire is very dangerous

410
00:28:55,550 --> 00:28:58,041
You may burn someone, yourself

411
00:28:58,553 --> 00:29:01,044
or even a whole house if you're not
careful, you know that

412
00:29:02,323 --> 00:29:05,258
There're many other fun things to play
with the fire

413
00:29:06,694 --> 00:29:08,662
Give me the candle! Give it to me

414
00:29:09,164 --> 00:29:12,429
And you, what's that in your pocket?
Cigarettes?

415
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:13,257
Give it to me

416
00:29:15,670 --> 00:29:18,366
Why don't you play yo-yo when you
have one?

417
00:29:19,374 --> 00:29:20,102
Give it to me

418
00:29:21,376 --> 00:29:22,104
Did you steal this?

419
00:29:22,544 --> 00:29:23,203
No

420
00:29:24,612 --> 00:29:25,169
No

421
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:29,106
Let me teach you how to play this

422
00:29:34,055 --> 00:29:37,047
Bring the dog out

423
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:40,325
Baby's cradle

424
00:29:42,230 --> 00:29:43,458
Around the world

425
00:29:44,098 --> 00:29:48,091
Here the top one, Extravaganza

426
00:29:48,436 --> 00:29:52,133
Play yo-yo and not fire, OK

427
00:29:53,074 --> 00:29:54,063
Go now, or l'll spat you

428
00:29:58,179 --> 00:29:59,305
Watch the cars

429
00:30:08,056 --> 00:30:09,717
l'm sorry, Miss,

430
00:30:10,391 --> 00:30:11,415
did they hurt you?

431
00:30:11,726 --> 00:30:12,522
l'm fine

432
00:30:13,027 --> 00:30:16,929
May l ask you where is this Lan's
Elderly Home?

433
00:30:17,465 --> 00:30:18,625
At the back, over there

434
00:30:19,367 --> 00:30:20,163
Thank you!

435
00:30:20,235 --> 00:30:22,066
Let me show you the way! lt's difficult
to find

436
00:30:22,537 --> 00:30:23,367
Sorry about the trouble

437
00:30:24,038 --> 00:30:25,005
You're from somewhere?

438
00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:25,801
l came from Shanghai

439
00:30:26,508 --> 00:30:27,065
You're very tall

440
00:30:28,977 --> 00:30:30,308
Who are you looking for at the Lan's?

441
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:34,471
No, my uncle wants to find
an elderly home

442
00:30:34,849 --> 00:30:36,282
l hope you don't mind me being nosy

443
00:30:36,951 --> 00:30:39,146
the place actually can't be taken as an

444
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:39,979
elderly home, there's no facilities

445
00:30:40,855 --> 00:30:43,289
Lan is a kind person

446
00:30:43,391 --> 00:30:45,188
but now can she take care of so many
elderly on her own

447
00:30:46,427 --> 00:30:48,691
Just taking care of their meals would
have killed her

448
00:30:48,863 --> 00:30:51,127
Your uncle should go somewhere else

449
00:30:51,666 --> 00:30:53,133
Excuse me, who is Lan?

450
00:30:53,968 --> 00:30:56,766
Lan is a kind-hearted person, she had a
pitiable past

451
00:30:57,472 --> 00:30:59,030
Her parents passed away when she was

452
00:30:59,474 --> 00:31:00,270
small, she married when she just got
over twenty

453
00:31:00,408 --> 00:31:01,705
but then her husband died a few years
later

454
00:31:02,343 --> 00:31:03,901
Leaving her nothing but this old flat and
its rent to live on

455
00:31:04,779 --> 00:31:05,746
Lan always says, she didn't take up her

456
00:31:05,914 --> 00:31:08,940
responsibility as a daughter when she
was young

457
00:31:09,684 --> 00:31:11,174
and now she runs this elderly home

458
00:31:11,853 --> 00:31:13,878
to compensate her fault

459
00:31:15,089 --> 00:31:16,078
You seem to know her very well

460
00:31:16,257 --> 00:31:17,121
You're a good friend of hers?

461
00:31:17,492 --> 00:31:20,586
l've been patrolling this area for a long
time, it's just something l heard

462
00:31:21,062 --> 00:31:22,154
9466, 9466 roger?

463
00:31:23,064 --> 00:31:24,122
9466, send

464
00:31:25,133 --> 00:31:27,192
6th floor, 24 Sring Alley

465
00:31:27,702 --> 00:31:31,035
an old man has fainted, go check it out

466
00:31:31,906 --> 00:31:33,601
9466 will go now

467
00:31:34,576 --> 00:31:35,235
lt's Lan's place

468
00:31:35,944 --> 00:31:38,174
What happen? Sir?

469
00:31:40,815 --> 00:31:42,908
Lan, is there somewhere quiet that l can

470
00:31:42,951 --> 00:31:44,009
take the witness report with you?

471
00:31:44,452 --> 00:31:47,319
Somewhere quiet? lt's a small place here

472
00:31:49,190 --> 00:31:49,986
come to my room

473
00:31:50,258 --> 00:31:51,282
OK

474
00:31:53,428 --> 00:31:54,793
Don't touch anything

475
00:31:57,398 --> 00:31:58,956
An old man goes 'home'!

476
00:32:00,134 --> 00:32:03,228
Someone's dead and you're so happy?

477
00:32:07,241 --> 00:32:08,538
l don't want you to feel sad

478
00:32:09,143 --> 00:32:11,668
Everything is fine, l've got to work

479
00:32:12,347 --> 00:32:14,440
Go back and take a rest

480
00:32:15,183 --> 00:32:16,047
Play mahjong

481
00:32:17,218 --> 00:32:20,085
Lan, this is Miss Wong, she's some to
see you

482
00:32:20,355 --> 00:32:23,882
Miss Wong, Sir Lung has told me about
you

483
00:32:24,726 --> 00:32:26,387
But l don't encourage those who don't

484
00:32:26,594 --> 00:32:27,458
take care of their own elderly

485
00:32:28,262 --> 00:32:31,891
The situation is, my uncle's family has
emigrated

486
00:32:38,439 --> 00:32:39,337
l've got a resident here who takes care

487
00:32:39,374 --> 00:32:40,966
of my elderly affairs

488
00:32:41,342 --> 00:32:43,037
Why don't you have leave your name
and phone number

489
00:32:43,077 --> 00:32:44,339
l'll ask him to call you back

490
00:32:46,047 --> 00:32:47,344
Are you looking for Wing?

491
00:32:47,915 --> 00:32:49,439
Yes, we are looking for Wing

492
00:32:49,817 --> 00:32:53,218
You're so smart, Ming

493
00:32:54,489 --> 00:32:56,116
Bring this lady to Wing, will you?

494
00:32:56,257 --> 00:32:56,746
Sure

495
00:32:57,058 --> 00:32:57,547
Really?

496
00:32:58,226 --> 00:32:59,318
Smart kid

497
00:32:59,627 --> 00:33:01,322
Lan, who is it this time?

498
00:33:01,796 --> 00:33:03,388
The schoolmaster! This room

499
00:33:10,238 --> 00:33:13,332
A bit small, but quite clean and tidy

500
00:33:15,076 --> 00:33:19,376
Sir Lung, are you here to do the report
or renting a room?

501
00:33:19,414 --> 00:33:20,108
The report, of course

502
00:33:22,283 --> 00:33:22,908
lD please

503
00:33:33,027 --> 00:33:33,789
Wong Mei Lan

504
00:33:36,064 --> 00:33:37,224
What's the name of the schoolmaster?

505
00:33:39,634 --> 00:33:40,532
Cheung Chi Choi

506
00:33:41,836 --> 00:33:42,666
Cheung spelt as C H E U N G?

507
00:33:42,904 --> 00:33:43,461
Yes

508
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:46,699
Lan

509
00:33:47,675 --> 00:33:48,573
besides residents here

510
00:33:48,643 --> 00:33:52,204
is there any man who would come here?

511
00:33:53,681 --> 00:33:54,648
What does that have to do with this?

512
00:33:55,683 --> 00:33:58,345
Someone's dead here, it's just routine
question

513
00:34:00,588 --> 00:34:01,577
Wing whom lives upstairs?

514
00:34:02,590 --> 00:34:03,716
Wing? He has already got a kid

515
00:34:04,726 --> 00:34:05,693
What do you want to know?

516
00:34:07,395 --> 00:34:08,726
Just asking

517
00:34:16,070 --> 00:34:17,196
Why are you ill? What's wrong?

518
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:20,434
l'm fine, it's just flu, thanks

519
00:34:22,143 --> 00:34:23,075
Are you from the northe rn region?

520
00:34:23,811 --> 00:34:24,778
Yes

521
00:34:25,246 --> 00:34:26,270
Do you speak Mandarin?

522
00:34:28,082 --> 00:34:29,379
l was born in Hong Kong

523
00:34:31,352 --> 00:34:32,148
Any other question? Done?

524
00:34:32,987 --> 00:34:33,715
Almost

525
00:34:35,990 --> 00:34:39,824
Lan, you've got to see a doctor when
you're ill

526
00:34:40,328 --> 00:34:42,558
Try Chinese medicine

527
00:34:45,166 --> 00:34:45,996
Thank you

528
00:34:53,107 --> 00:34:54,039
l'll see you off

529
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:16,218
Ming, you're not taking care of your
guest

530
00:35:17,031 --> 00:35:18,259
go get a popsicle for the lady

531
00:35:20,501 --> 00:35:21,991
Orange Flavor?

532
00:35:22,503 --> 00:35:23,470
No thanks, Ming

533
00:35:24,038 --> 00:35:25,938
lt's delicious, l'll get it for you

534
00:35:28,609 --> 00:35:30,975
Am l bothering you with your work?

535
00:35:31,012 --> 00:35:34,277
Of course not, just daily stuff

536
00:35:36,484 --> 00:35:38,884
Ming/.,;'/.,;'/.,;' is very cute

537
00:35:42,557 --> 00:35:44,354
Does Wing always leave Ming behind
like this

538
00:35:44,592 --> 00:35:46,287
Just let him wander around?

539
00:35:48,529 --> 00:35:51,726
Actually, l think, Ming really needs a
mother

540
00:35:51,766 --> 00:35:56,726
Don't you think so?

541
00:36:00,441 --> 00:36:02,033
Are you a vegetarian?

542
00:36:02,710 --> 00:36:04,200
Your skin looks very soft and smooth

543
00:36:08,349 --> 00:36:09,816
lt's for the lady

544
00:36:11,519 --> 00:36:12,213
Which lady?

545
00:36:12,453 --> 00:36:13,078
Kwan

546
00:36:14,589 --> 00:36:18,320
Oh yes, Lan asked Ming to bring her to
see you

547
00:36:18,860 --> 00:36:19,827
She's taking advantage of me again

548
00:36:22,263 --> 00:36:24,231
My name is Wong, l/.,;'/.,;'/.,;'

549
00:36:24,398 --> 00:36:25,797
Daniel Lee, where are you going?

550
00:36:26,634 --> 00:36:27,464
East and West Road

551
00:36:28,069 --> 00:36:28,660
Great

552
00:36:31,672 --> 00:36:33,264
Yours, thank you

553
00:36:33,574 --> 00:36:34,336
lt's my uncle

554
00:36:34,375 --> 00:36:35,569
Let's walk back while you talk

555
00:36:36,377 --> 00:36:41,371
Registered mail, yours

556
00:36:42,617 --> 00:36:43,311
She's pretty

557
00:36:44,285 --> 00:36:45,343
Quite a good match

558
00:36:45,786 --> 00:36:46,445
Too tall

559
00:36:46,921 --> 00:36:48,286
lf she is changing it to children's home

560
00:36:48,456 --> 00:36:50,048
l don't think she'll take in any more
elderly

561
00:36:50,658 --> 00:36:52,592
l think you'd better find another place for
your uncle

562
00:36:53,361 --> 00:36:54,589
Thanks anyway

563
00:37:00,902 --> 00:37:01,527
Ming

564
00:37:01,702 --> 00:37:02,930
Who's in 3A

565
00:37:03,137 --> 00:37:04,297
l know, fatty Cheung

566
00:37:04,639 --> 00:37:05,936
OK, go

567
00:37:08,009 --> 00:37:09,806
Ming's mother has gone to work?

568
00:37:11,312 --> 00:37:13,837
She left him behind when he's only a few
months old

569
00:37:14,815 --> 00:37:15,440
Cold blooded

570
00:37:18,586 --> 00:37:20,349
lf there's a children's home here

571
00:37:20,922 --> 00:37:23,652
then kids like Ming would be better off

572
00:37:25,359 --> 00:37:26,223
Not really

573
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:30,018
Taking care children doesn't mean only
literally taking care of them

574
00:37:30,564 --> 00:37:32,589
You need to have a loving heart, time

575
00:37:35,069 --> 00:37:35,797
Are you married?

576
00:37:38,472 --> 00:37:39,131
Are you married?

577
00:37:39,173 --> 00:37:40,105
Yes

578
00:37:40,741 --> 00:37:41,332
Got kids?

579
00:37:43,577 --> 00:37:44,441
Not yet

580
00:37:45,746 --> 00:37:47,043
Well, when you have kids

581
00:37:47,581 --> 00:37:49,344
come see me then, l'll teach you

582
00:37:51,619 --> 00:37:52,551
l'd better go

583
00:37:53,187 --> 00:37:54,882
Keep in touch, bye

584
00:37:54,989 --> 00:37:55,387
Bye

585
00:37:56,624 --> 00:37:58,489
Stop fussing

586
00:38:03,764 --> 00:38:06,130
lt's over a thousand dollars, we don't
have the money

587
00:38:06,167 --> 00:38:06,997
Let's go

588
00:38:12,406 --> 00:38:14,636
What did you say just now?

589
00:38:16,043 --> 00:38:17,670
You're only a 4 years old baby

590
00:38:18,446 --> 00:38:19,470
who taught you to talk like that?

591
00:38:20,147 --> 00:38:23,014
Look who's talking?

592
00:38:23,985 --> 00:38:24,713
How dare you

593
00:38:25,152 --> 00:38:26,915
Kid, don't try to behave like an adult

594
00:38:27,655 --> 00:38:29,646
You'll regret when you grow up

595
00:38:41,402 --> 00:38:42,061
Ming

596
00:38:43,838 --> 00:38:44,827
Look at your shoestring

597
00:38:45,172 --> 00:38:46,298
Come, sit down

598
00:38:47,375 --> 00:38:48,603
Didn't Wing teach you how to tie your
shoestring?

599
00:38:49,010 --> 00:38:49,738
For whom?

600
00:38:50,911 --> 00:38:51,878
For Lan

601
00:38:53,114 --> 00:38:54,411
Lan took advantage of you?

602
00:38:54,682 --> 00:38:57,173
No! it's a gift for Lan

603
00:38:58,119 --> 00:38:58,847
What's this?

604
00:38:59,387 --> 00:39:01,617
Orchid bulbs, will grow orchid flowers!

605
00:39:01,789 --> 00:39:02,551
How?

606
00:39:04,558 --> 00:39:05,718
Lan knows how!

607
00:39:06,060 --> 00:39:06,754
Bring this to her for me

608
00:39:39,827 --> 00:39:41,351
Let's be partner

609
00:39:43,297 --> 00:39:45,629
l'm making money, in the way you taught
me

610
00:39:47,435 --> 00:39:48,561
You're good with foreign exchange

611
00:39:49,603 --> 00:39:50,433
Piece of cake

612
00:39:51,338 --> 00:39:52,498
easier than stocks

613
00:39:53,274 --> 00:39:55,674
Don't be so serious! lt's just a game

614
00:39:57,978 --> 00:39:58,945
You were not like that

615
00:40:00,448 --> 00:40:01,608
l knew how to act then

616
00:40:07,621 --> 00:40:08,815
l still have a kid to take care of

617
00:40:11,025 --> 00:40:12,014
lf you come back and work

618
00:40:12,426 --> 00:40:13,893
you can earn at least a hundred thousand
dollars per month

619
00:40:15,129 --> 00:40:17,097
You can hire over ten Philippine maids
to look after him

620
00:40:19,467 --> 00:40:20,627
lt's not like that

621
00:40:22,837 --> 00:40:23,496
Fine

622
00:40:24,772 --> 00:40:26,034
think carefully, call me any time

623
00:40:31,278 --> 00:40:32,438
Cheers

624
00:40:34,849 --> 00:40:35,816
What's up? What are you celebrating?

625
00:40:36,250 --> 00:40:37,774
Wing, Wing, cheers

626
00:40:38,853 --> 00:40:39,820
This suits, l wear for my company

627
00:40:41,689 --> 00:40:43,623
He got a job at last

628
00:40:44,592 --> 00:40:47,254
U-grade should bet a job with a suit

629
00:40:47,628 --> 00:40:49,357
There's no future just sitting in shop

630
00:40:49,463 --> 00:40:50,122
A man is a man

631
00:40:52,299 --> 00:40:53,527
lt's a temp! For the time being!

632
00:40:54,401 --> 00:40:56,266
What do you mean by temp? lt's a job

633
00:40:57,371 --> 00:40:58,963
Let's eat

634
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:10,642
Wing, you've got letters

635
00:41:11,185 --> 00:41:11,810
Letters?

636
00:41:17,391 --> 00:41:21,953
Seems like some good news for Lan's
children's home

637
00:41:23,397 --> 00:41:23,988
Yes!

638
00:41:26,901 --> 00:41:27,629
And this?

639
00:41:31,939 --> 00:41:33,736
Nosy body, l'm not telling you

640
00:41:53,194 --> 00:41:55,059
Sir Lung, you're looking for me?

641
00:41:55,362 --> 00:41:57,159
Where's Ming?

642
00:41:58,566 --> 00:41:59,555
You're looking for Ming?

643
00:42:01,168 --> 00:42:02,294
Seems like he's not back yet!

644
00:42:02,670 --> 00:42:04,001
Mind didn't come today?

645
00:42:05,306 --> 00:42:06,432
Probably not yet

646
00:42:07,441 --> 00:42:08,601
Let him come back first, Ming

647
00:42:11,445 --> 00:42:12,139
Ming

648
00:42:12,313 --> 00:42:12,745
Sir Lung

649
00:42:14,815 --> 00:42:16,112
Did you give it to Lan?

650
00:42:16,717 --> 00:42:18,742
Sure! The orchid bulbs

651
00:42:19,987 --> 00:42:22,683
What orchid bulbs? Those are water
lily bulbs

652
00:42:23,190 --> 00:42:25,158
lt's too early for them; it's not Chinese
New Year yet

653
00:42:25,559 --> 00:42:27,424
Oh? They are water lily bulbs

654
00:42:30,698 --> 00:42:31,289
Bye now

655
00:42:31,599 --> 00:42:32,122
Wait, wait

656
00:42:33,601 --> 00:42:35,034
These flowerpot and soil, also suitable
lilies

657
00:42:37,238 --> 00:42:38,227
Thank you!

658
00:42:43,377 --> 00:42:45,607
Lan, the Foundation has a letter for you

659
00:42:45,913 --> 00:42:47,005
They want to see you

660
00:42:47,982 --> 00:42:48,573
Really?

661
00:42:52,486 --> 00:42:53,453
But l'm ill/.,;'/.,;'/.,;'

662
00:42:53,654 --> 00:42:55,645
OK, OK! lt's me anyway

663
00:42:56,557 --> 00:42:57,615
Thanks, Wing

664
00:42:57,725 --> 00:42:59,750
You'd better rest more, you're still so ill

665
00:43:00,060 --> 00:43:00,754
lt's not getting better

666
00:43:01,428 --> 00:43:02,292
Thanks again, Wing

667
00:43:12,072 --> 00:43:14,939
Whoever loses the race will wash
the dishes

668
00:43:15,276 --> 00:43:18,712
One, two, three

669
00:44:55,209 --> 00:44:57,439
l know l'd promised you the beach

670
00:44:57,644 --> 00:44:58,633
but l've to do something important first

671
00:44:58,679 --> 00:44:59,475
l'll come back and fetch you afterwards

672
00:44:59,513 --> 00:44:59,842
OK?

673
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:00,539
OK!

674
00:45:00,581 --> 00:45:02,446
l'll be back soon, OK

675
00:45:02,483 --> 00:45:03,142
OK

676
00:45:03,183 --> 00:45:06,084
Wait for me, bye

677
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:07,052
Bye

678
00:46:01,241 --> 00:46:02,936
Mr. Lee, please come in, Mrs. Leung
is expecting you

679
00:46:10,284 --> 00:46:11,046
Come in, please sit down

680
00:46:12,386 --> 00:46:13,717
l'm sorry about last time

681
00:46:14,054 --> 00:46:15,316
l didn't explain clearly

682
00:46:16,056 --> 00:46:18,684
lt's OK, you're only disguising to see
the truth

683
00:46:22,229 --> 00:46:23,321
Here's the cheque

684
00:46:24,097 --> 00:46:26,190
ls Lan's name correct?

685
00:46:27,334 --> 00:46:29,461
lf not, l can write another one

686
00:46:31,038 --> 00:46:32,027
There shouldn't be any problem

687
00:46:32,940 --> 00:46:35,135
Actually, you've only see Lan once

688
00:46:35,209 --> 00:46:36,039
what makes you believe in us?

689
00:46:37,611 --> 00:46:40,045
When doing charity, one can't be so
calculative

690
00:46:40,447 --> 00:46:41,539
l know she's sincere

691
00:46:44,351 --> 00:46:47,650
Here are some documents, l need you
to fill in them

692
00:46:48,188 --> 00:46:50,452
They're for lnland Revenue and Social
Welfare

693
00:46:51,525 --> 00:46:52,150
No problem

694
00:46:54,161 --> 00:46:56,959
Then Ming won't have to wander around
anymore?

695
00:46:58,198 --> 00:46:59,290
That may not be so

696
00:46:59,600 --> 00:47:02,398
you know, l travel a lot for work

697
00:47:02,469 --> 00:47:03,959
and he has to follow me

698
00:47:04,938 --> 00:47:06,371
Mrs. Leung, the security says that

699
00:47:06,406 --> 00:47:08,169
this child was playing around downstairs
on his own

700
00:47:13,780 --> 00:47:14,439
Wing

701
00:47:15,415 --> 00:47:16,143
Thank you, lvy

702
00:47:16,984 --> 00:47:17,882
Why are you here

703
00:47:18,051 --> 00:47:19,609
That uncle brought me here

704
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:20,852
Brought you here

705
00:47:21,588 --> 00:47:23,385
You brought him here and you left him
downstairs?

706
00:47:23,624 --> 00:47:26,388
l didn't bring him, he follows me

707
00:47:27,494 --> 00:47:29,223
Didn't l ask you to wait for me at home?

708
00:47:30,097 --> 00:47:32,497
Did you promise to bring Ming to the
beach?

709
00:47:35,035 --> 00:47:35,660
Wanna join us?

710
00:47:36,737 --> 00:47:37,635
l don't know how to swim

711
00:47:38,305 --> 00:47:39,363
We are not swimming

712
00:47:39,439 --> 00:47:42,533
l want to show him something uncommon

713
00:49:08,428 --> 00:49:09,258
lt's cloudy

714
00:49:24,611 --> 00:49:25,737
Why were you so angry just now

715
00:49:27,180 --> 00:49:29,512
Because of the sky, there're cloud

716
00:49:29,883 --> 00:49:30,815
Why does that matter?

717
00:49:34,588 --> 00:49:35,316
l'm not telling you

718
00:49:38,525 --> 00:49:41,494
Actually, l think Ming needs another

719
00:49:43,397 --> 00:49:46,332
l did whatever a mother do to a child

720
00:49:48,168 --> 00:49:50,432
only except breast-feeding

721
00:49:51,304 --> 00:49:54,671
To him, l'm both father and mother

722
00:49:57,177 --> 00:49:58,269
Actually l don't think you are the kind of

723
00:49:58,745 --> 00:50:01,612
person who does temp work

724
00:50:02,315 --> 00:50:03,805
who can just let days by

725
00:50:04,751 --> 00:50:06,150
l think you belong to Central

726
00:50:06,186 --> 00:50:06,811
l know what you mean

727
00:50:11,291 --> 00:50:11,985
l did that

728
00:50:12,893 --> 00:50:13,587
Did what?

729
00:50:14,628 --> 00:50:16,027
l did what you think l should do

730
00:50:19,700 --> 00:50:20,291
Funds

731
00:50:20,967 --> 00:50:21,490
Really?

732
00:50:21,768 --> 00:50:23,292
Funds manager, the best

733
00:50:24,738 --> 00:50:27,764
So, what can you say about life

734
00:50:29,943 --> 00:50:30,671
But l do believe

735
00:50:30,711 --> 00:50:33,373
as long as you don't give up, you'll
survive anyhow

736
00:50:38,418 --> 00:50:40,010
Survive anyhow?

737
00:50:41,288 --> 00:50:42,550
You heard of the crash

738
00:50:43,490 --> 00:50:44,923
lt's just one afternoon, know how much
l lost?

739
00:50:46,326 --> 00:50:47,554
Survive some how?

740
00:50:48,395 --> 00:50:49,885
That's how you lost all your money?

741
00:50:51,398 --> 00:50:55,232
Not my money, it's my clients' money

742
00:50:59,706 --> 00:51:01,697
lf l'll have to pack back all the monies

743
00:51:03,176 --> 00:51:04,700
a few more lifetime couldn't even be
possible

744
00:51:11,551 --> 00:51:12,643
As for my money

745
00:51:19,593 --> 00:51:20,855
l gave them all to my woman

746
00:51:24,030 --> 00:51:26,021
Then you must love her very much

747
00:51:29,102 --> 00:51:30,865
At that time, l thought she loves me more

748
00:51:30,904 --> 00:51:31,962
than l do to her

749
00:51:33,974 --> 00:51:35,908
She later found that

750
00:51:35,942 --> 00:51:39,503
l wasn't the kind of man that she likes

751
00:51:45,952 --> 00:51:46,714
Just like that

752
00:51:55,462 --> 00:51:56,326
You're still young

753
00:51:58,632 --> 00:52:00,190
You can start all over, anything will do

754
00:52:03,036 --> 00:52:04,264
Besides, you've got Ming with you

755
00:52:09,576 --> 00:52:11,737
Maybe it's because l lost someone whom
l wanna love

756
00:52:13,246 --> 00:52:16,044
here comes someone who wanna me to
love

757
00:52:16,950 --> 00:52:17,507
ls that right?

758
00:52:17,551 --> 00:52:18,210
Right

759
00:52:18,752 --> 00:52:20,242
Burn more candles

760
00:52:23,924 --> 00:52:25,050
Since then

761
00:52:26,493 --> 00:52:30,020
whenever l can't sleep at night, l look at
the sky

762
00:52:31,932 --> 00:52:34,492
That's why l started to fall in love
watching stars

763
00:52:35,502 --> 00:52:36,093
Shooting stars

764
00:52:37,070 --> 00:52:37,559
Really?

765
00:52:39,973 --> 00:52:41,099
They are so beautiful

766
00:52:42,976 --> 00:52:44,273
Yes so short-lived

767
00:52:45,011 --> 00:52:48,378
Not really

768
00:52:48,415 --> 00:52:49,177
lt's because they are so short-lived

769
00:52:49,249 --> 00:52:52,309
that's why you find them brilliant and
beautiful

770
00:52:52,619 --> 00:52:53,244
You're pretty too

771
00:52:54,554 --> 00:52:56,454
but can you guarantee that you can be as
pretty life long?

772
00:52:57,057 --> 00:52:58,752
Can you forever rely on makeup?

773
00:53:04,130 --> 00:53:04,755
Let me tell you

774
00:53:04,831 --> 00:53:05,627
l'm angry today because it's cloudy

775
00:53:06,299 --> 00:53:08,893
and we can't see the shooting stars

776
00:53:09,436 --> 00:53:10,562
Really? Where?

777
00:53:11,705 --> 00:53:12,399
Northeast side

778
00:53:14,774 --> 00:53:19,006
Then l can make a lot of wishes

779
00:53:19,279 --> 00:53:20,109
See how greedy you are

780
00:53:22,249 --> 00:53:23,238
l'm not greedy

781
00:53:26,620 --> 00:53:28,053
Since you like stars so much

782
00:53:29,656 --> 00:53:32,216
have you ever considered studying
astrology?

783
00:53:34,995 --> 00:53:36,053
Have you heard of Greenwich?

784
00:53:37,530 --> 00:53:38,189
Yes

785
00:53:38,732 --> 00:53:39,391
That Observatory

786
00:53:43,136 --> 00:53:43,966
They offered me a job there

787
00:53:45,605 --> 00:53:46,196
Really?

788
00:53:47,707 --> 00:53:48,605
Congratulations

789
00:53:50,110 --> 00:53:51,042
When are you going then?

790
00:53:53,046 --> 00:53:53,705
l don't know yet

791
00:53:55,882 --> 00:53:57,008
Their living conditions

792
00:53:57,150 --> 00:53:58,344
doesn't allow me to bring anybody along

793
00:53:59,419 --> 00:54:00,010
That's impossible

794
00:54:06,526 --> 00:54:09,461
Actually, l can get someone to take care
of Ming

795
00:54:10,797 --> 00:54:13,595
He can then grow up in a better
environment

796
00:54:16,303 --> 00:54:18,897
and you can go to do what you like

797
00:54:24,277 --> 00:54:25,209
Let me think about it

798
00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:27,803
Thanks for offering

799
00:54:32,519 --> 00:54:33,577
See, shooting stars

800
00:54:35,488 --> 00:54:36,580
lt's beautiful

801
00:54:36,656 --> 00:54:38,283
lt's started

802
00:54:47,133 --> 00:54:48,065
Ming can you see?

803
00:54:51,371 --> 00:54:52,360
lt's beautiful

804
00:54:55,008 --> 00:54:56,134
lt's beautiful

805
00:57:05,572 --> 00:57:06,266
What is it?

806
00:57:07,674 --> 00:57:08,698
Cigarette? Show me

807
00:57:11,211 --> 00:57:12,007
Superman

808
00:57:13,546 --> 00:57:14,342
Where did you get this?

809
00:57:14,848 --> 00:57:15,974
l just found it up there

810
00:57:17,684 --> 00:57:19,709
Up there?

811
00:57:21,788 --> 00:57:23,915
Don't play with fire anymore, superman
is fine

812
00:57:30,463 --> 00:57:31,430
What a big mess?

813
00:57:32,899 --> 00:57:33,763
Are we having a war?

814
00:57:43,076 --> 00:57:44,543
Wing, how about this?

815
00:57:45,345 --> 00:57:47,813
We've got lots already, and it's so dirty

816
00:57:48,214 --> 00:57:48,976
Find something else

817
00:57:51,384 --> 00:57:52,408
This book is much better

818
00:57:53,119 --> 00:57:56,987
Sir Lung, just moved out, see if anything
suitable

819
00:57:57,257 --> 00:57:58,588
Did you have the consent of the owner?

820
00:57:59,259 --> 00:58:01,022
Can't be bothered! lt's not the first time

821
00:58:01,594 --> 00:58:02,356
You go and take a look too

822
00:58:04,063 --> 00:58:05,462
Wing, come out

823
00:58:11,337 --> 00:58:12,167
What is it? Sir Lung

824
00:58:13,706 --> 00:58:16,106
We never discriminate on what job a
person is doing

825
00:58:16,276 --> 00:58:17,971
as long as he is earning with his own
ability

826
00:58:18,011 --> 00:58:18,773
that he is not stealing from someone, right?

827
00:58:20,580 --> 00:58:21,478
What do you want to say?

828
00:58:22,282 --> 00:58:23,306
l hope you don't mind

829
00:58:23,917 --> 00:58:25,316
l just thought whatever you do is fine

830
00:58:25,952 --> 00:58:27,214
but Ming is only four years old

831
00:58:27,987 --> 00:58:29,079
He has still got a long way to go

832
00:58:30,690 --> 00:58:31,987
You shouldn't let him get used to

833
00:58:32,225 --> 00:58:34,386
growing up amongst all these rubbish

834
00:58:34,994 --> 00:58:36,393
and still feeling happy about it

835
00:58:37,630 --> 00:58:41,862
Those kids, if their parents haven't been
working

836
00:58:42,468 --> 00:58:44,732
they wouldn't let them to play around in
the rubbish

837
00:58:45,405 --> 00:58:46,167
You should understand what l mean

838
00:58:52,445 --> 00:58:54,572
Wing, you wanted feelings in things
you do

839
00:58:55,582 --> 00:58:56,947
But Ming needs a future

840
00:58:58,051 --> 00:58:58,949
Understand

841
00:59:02,689 --> 00:59:03,451
Wing

842
00:59:10,863 --> 00:59:11,852
Where did you find this?

843
00:59:12,699 --> 00:59:13,666
l found it down there

844
00:59:21,541 --> 00:59:23,941
So this is my company, all you can see

845
00:59:24,611 --> 00:59:25,475
Good morning, Mr. Leung

846
00:59:29,749 --> 00:59:32,718
You'll use this room for time being

847
00:59:44,163 --> 00:59:45,130
Piece of cake

848
00:59:51,404 --> 00:59:54,168
Let's go shopping after lunch, OK

849
00:59:57,176 --> 00:59:57,870
Sam

850
01:00:00,313 --> 01:00:01,007
Thanks

851
01:00:05,952 --> 01:00:07,385
Mr. Lee, l'm Eva,

852
01:00:07,487 --> 01:00:08,818
just page me if you need me

853
01:00:09,555 --> 01:00:10,385
Thank you

854
01:00:11,658 --> 01:00:12,181
Eva

855
01:01:11,551 --> 01:01:12,176
Daniel

856
01:01:39,145 --> 01:01:41,045
We can put aside some food for Wing

857
01:01:41,414 --> 01:01:42,312
Come on, let's eat

858
01:01:43,716 --> 01:01:44,205
Ming

859
01:01:45,585 --> 01:01:46,142
Wing

860
01:01:48,588 --> 01:01:49,384
You're home

861
01:01:52,392 --> 01:01:54,326
Mr. Lee, l'm lvy, Mrs. Leung's assistant

862
01:01:55,928 --> 01:01:57,589
l met you at the office a few days ago

863
01:01:59,232 --> 01:02:02,565
l've brought the contract for Lan to sign

864
01:02:02,802 --> 01:02:03,996
and she told me to show you first

865
01:02:04,937 --> 01:02:07,132
Ming was alone and there was nothing
to eat

866
01:02:07,407 --> 01:02:08,601
l'm sorry to have taken so much of
your time

867
01:02:09,208 --> 01:02:11,176
lt's OK, l called Mrs. Leung

868
01:02:11,778 --> 01:02:12,938
she asked me to stay behind

869
01:02:15,882 --> 01:02:18,180
Ming's hungry, Why don't you have
dinner first

870
01:02:20,019 --> 01:02:20,781
l'm leaving

871
01:02:25,825 --> 01:02:26,587
Wait a minute

872
01:02:29,629 --> 01:02:32,393
Ming, can you tell this lady

873
01:02:32,899 --> 01:02:34,594
Have l ever ignore you

874
01:02:35,201 --> 01:02:36,099
and leave you with no dinner

875
01:02:38,671 --> 01:02:40,935
lgnore me, no, without dinner, yes

876
01:02:44,410 --> 01:02:45,638
l just remember that l have to go back
to the office

877
01:02:46,012 --> 01:02:47,070
These stuff are too heavy

878
01:02:47,780 --> 01:02:48,337
Bye now

879
01:02:50,082 --> 01:02:50,776
Mrs. Leung

880
01:02:52,218 --> 01:02:52,980
Kwan

881
01:02:59,058 --> 01:02:59,922
Oh you're back

882
01:03:00,626 --> 01:03:03,060
lvy told me that Ming has been waiting
for you for a whole day

883
01:03:05,531 --> 01:03:07,931
l need to work for living , Miss lvy

884
01:03:08,634 --> 01:03:10,192
Money just doesn't come running into
the house itself

885
01:03:11,304 --> 01:03:13,169
But still you shouldn't leave a 4 years
old child at home alone

886
01:03:13,206 --> 01:03:15,766
Don't you know that it's illegal

887
01:03:23,850 --> 01:03:26,250
l know you wanted to be with the child

888
01:03:26,886 --> 01:03:28,649
but a child need someone who can take
care of him

889
01:03:29,422 --> 01:03:32,448
why don't you consider about sending
him to boarding school?

890
01:03:32,492 --> 01:03:33,925
lt's OK, thank you

891
01:03:34,827 --> 01:03:35,521
We're fine

892
01:03:36,362 --> 01:03:37,021
Fine?

893
01:03:37,363 --> 01:03:38,921
He doesn't even know how to take care
of a kid

894
01:03:40,633 --> 01:03:41,725
l don't?

895
01:03:42,568 --> 01:03:43,933
l've been taking care of him for 4 years

896
01:03:45,037 --> 01:03:45,901
He's very happy

897
01:03:46,539 --> 01:03:47,403
Only for the time being

898
01:03:48,908 --> 01:03:50,933
Taking care of children is not only
making them happy

899
01:03:51,511 --> 01:03:54,036
lt's not that difficult to make a child
happy

900
01:03:54,280 --> 01:03:54,769
l agree

901
01:03:56,616 --> 01:03:57,344
Really?

902
01:03:59,218 --> 01:04:02,813
OK, Ming

903
01:04:03,789 --> 01:04:05,347
You'll bring him away for 1 or 2 days

904
01:04:06,058 --> 01:04:07,047
try taking care of him

905
01:04:07,527 --> 01:04:08,255
and try to make him happy

906
01:04:09,362 --> 01:04:10,795
Deal, just wait and see

907
01:04:12,899 --> 01:04:13,422
How is it?

908
01:04:21,040 --> 01:04:21,904
Let's watch TV

909
01:04:25,044 --> 01:04:27,308
Shall we sleep early so that we can get

910
01:04:27,346 --> 01:04:28,370
up early tomorrow and go out to play

911
01:04:28,548 --> 01:04:30,243
l can't sleep so early

912
01:04:31,684 --> 01:04:32,548
Don't be so boring?

913
01:04:35,621 --> 01:04:36,713
Let's watch the stars

914
01:04:39,659 --> 01:04:41,092
What shall l do, Dr. Chung?

915
01:04:42,395 --> 01:04:45,057
You should relax and play with him

916
01:04:46,065 --> 01:04:46,690
Play what?

917
01:04:49,135 --> 01:04:50,534
l've no toys here

918
01:04:51,270 --> 01:04:52,294
lt doesn't matter

919
01:04:52,838 --> 01:04:54,465
ask him what he wants to play

920
01:04:54,840 --> 01:04:55,829
use some imagination

921
01:04:56,208 --> 01:04:58,176
a child can hold a pillow and think that
it's an airplane

922
01:04:58,611 --> 01:05:01,079
This is a good opportunity to deal with
your fear

923
01:05:01,547 --> 01:05:02,639
Call me if you need me

924
01:05:03,382 --> 01:05:04,906
Thank you

925
01:05:17,730 --> 01:05:20,631
Mrs. Leung, Maybe l bring Ming back
to my place tonight

926
01:05:23,603 --> 01:05:25,537
Just the two of you?

927
01:06:10,149 --> 01:06:12,208
l'll bring Ming out tomorrow

928
01:06:13,419 --> 01:06:15,080
Where's Ming

929
01:06:15,554 --> 01:06:16,714
We were watching stars just now

930
01:06:18,424 --> 01:06:19,220
l'll go check there

931
01:06:38,377 --> 01:06:39,901
No, he's not here

932
01:06:44,216 --> 01:06:47,208
Ming, you scared me to death

933
01:06:47,586 --> 01:06:49,486
l'm sorry, shouldn't have let the kid to
run around

934
01:06:49,655 --> 01:06:50,747
lt's Ok, it's usual that a kid lost his way

935
01:06:52,892 --> 01:06:53,586
What is this?

936
01:06:54,326 --> 01:06:55,554
Don't touch other people's thing

937
01:06:55,928 --> 01:06:56,724
Come on

938
01:06:57,029 --> 01:06:58,656
What is it? l wanna know

939
01:06:58,698 --> 01:07:00,325
Use to talk with other uncles here

940
01:07:01,967 --> 01:07:02,956
Good night! Mrs. Leung

941
01:07:04,003 --> 01:07:04,992
Excuse me,

942
01:07:05,037 --> 01:07:05,969
There's something l'd like to discuss with
you

943
01:07:30,629 --> 01:07:31,220
Sir Lung

944
01:07:33,432 --> 01:07:33,955
looking for Lan?

945
01:07:34,934 --> 01:07:36,561
Can you give this to Lan for me

946
01:07:36,969 --> 01:07:37,526
What's it?

947
01:07:37,870 --> 01:07:39,963
lt's fertilizer, for the lilies

948
01:07:43,809 --> 01:07:47,745
Wing, tell Lan to try a few more doctors

949
01:07:48,380 --> 01:07:50,177
Some doctors nowadays are not so
ethical

950
01:07:50,683 --> 01:07:51,581
Why don't you tell her yourself

951
01:07:52,685 --> 01:07:53,515
You know why

952
01:07:55,588 --> 01:07:56,885
Got to go, thanks

953
01:07:56,956 --> 01:07:57,718
Bye

954
01:08:03,162 --> 01:08:03,958
Wing? lt's you?

955
01:08:06,866 --> 01:08:07,594
Looking for Sir Lung?

956
01:08:08,167 --> 01:08:08,826
He's gone

957
01:08:10,736 --> 01:08:12,499
He gave you this fertilizer

958
01:08:15,741 --> 01:08:16,708
He left so soon

959
01:08:17,076 --> 01:08:17,838
Can l use your phone?

960
01:08:20,412 --> 01:08:22,744
You must have forgotten the bill and have
your line disconnected

961
01:08:29,622 --> 01:08:31,613
Brother Wah, it's wing

962
01:08:32,558 --> 01:08:33,582
Any jobs these few days?

963
01:08:36,128 --> 01:08:37,925
Remember to call me. OK

964
01:08:47,606 --> 01:08:49,471
Hello, Brother Cha, it's Wing

965
01:08:50,576 --> 01:08:52,168
Any boat that need to scrape the shells?

966
01:08:54,647 --> 01:08:55,875
l'm available if you need me

967
01:09:01,020 --> 01:09:02,920
Hello, Miss May, it's Wing

968
01:09:03,589 --> 01:09:04,578
The one who delivers clothes

969
01:09:06,759 --> 01:09:08,021
do you need someone to deliver your
clothes?

970
01:09:37,790 --> 01:09:39,314
You didn't like it here?

971
01:09:40,025 --> 01:09:43,051
You come out first, l'm tired

972
01:09:44,029 --> 01:09:45,587
ls Ming missing his father?

973
01:09:47,867 --> 01:09:48,526
Are you?

974
01:09:49,869 --> 01:09:51,393
Wing was so fierce

975
01:09:53,339 --> 01:09:54,738
Has him been like that before?

976
01:09:55,174 --> 01:09:55,799
No

977
01:09:56,609 --> 01:09:58,099
Maybe he's unhappy

978
01:09:58,911 --> 01:10:00,344
Has Ming been unhappy before?

979
01:10:03,582 --> 01:10:04,879
When l'm unhappy

980
01:10:04,917 --> 01:10:06,680
Wing would try to make me happy again

981
01:10:07,920 --> 01:10:09,353
How did he do it?

982
01:10:09,622 --> 01:10:11,055
He sang to me

983
01:10:12,424 --> 01:10:15,120
That's it, Wing would sing to Ming

984
01:10:15,160 --> 01:10:17,094
Would Ming sing to him too?

985
01:10:17,496 --> 01:10:19,396
Wing doesn't want me to sing!

986
01:10:19,665 --> 01:10:21,326
He said l sang like a pig

987
01:10:21,567 --> 01:10:22,534
and scared away everyone

988
01:10:29,642 --> 01:10:31,132
You don't have to sing

989
01:10:31,877 --> 01:10:33,344
You can be good and listen to him

990
01:10:34,847 --> 01:10:35,575
Really?

991
01:10:36,882 --> 01:10:43,754
lf you listen to me, l'll be very happy too

992
01:10:48,527 --> 01:10:49,926
lf l'll listen to you and be good

993
01:10:49,962 --> 01:10:51,827
will you tell Wing about it?

994
01:12:52,885 --> 01:12:53,647
Ming

995
01:13:10,936 --> 01:13:16,738
Look, Ming, let's go on board

996
01:13:21,246 --> 01:13:23,578
Wing, Ming is going to steer the ship

997
01:13:27,953 --> 01:13:30,183
lf you steer like this, all the people will die

998
01:13:32,958 --> 01:13:35,791
To make a child happy is really not that
difficult

999
01:13:40,899 --> 01:13:47,270
l'm sorry, l've bought him too much one
time

1000
01:13:48,974 --> 01:13:51,704
You just want to make him happy

1001
01:13:51,910 --> 01:13:53,309
Actually, Ming makes me happy

1002
01:13:53,512 --> 01:13:56,538
These two days there were the happiest
days l ever had

1003
01:13:59,952 --> 01:14:02,182
There's something l want to discuss with
you

1004
01:14:03,021 --> 01:14:04,921
didn't you say that you want go to
Greenwich

1005
01:14:05,958 --> 01:14:07,550
Maybe you can let Ming stay with me

1006
01:14:08,260 --> 01:14:10,490
then you can go and do what you can to
do

1007
01:14:11,196 --> 01:14:12,185
At the president suite

1008
01:14:14,867 --> 01:14:16,061
l can buy a house

1009
01:14:17,102 --> 01:14:18,364
somewhere close to you

1010
01:14:18,737 --> 01:14:19,567
l'm serious

1011
01:14:22,040 --> 01:14:23,302
l really like Ming a lot

1012
01:14:23,909 --> 01:14:25,001
why don't you think about it

1013
01:14:25,711 --> 01:14:26,735
You'd better rest, bye

1014
01:14:26,778 --> 01:14:27,506
Bye

1015
01:15:12,057 --> 01:15:12,751
Give it to us

1016
01:15:13,292 --> 01:15:14,259
You wan to rob me

1017
01:15:14,760 --> 01:15:18,457
Come on, one, two, three

1018
01:15:28,140 --> 01:15:28,834
Look! They're back

1019
01:15:30,976 --> 01:15:32,307
Stop

1020
01:15:40,252 --> 01:15:41,116
lt's mine

1021
01:15:45,724 --> 01:15:46,952
Watch out

1022
01:15:50,762 --> 01:15:52,093
l've over ten years' driving experience

1023
01:15:52,331 --> 01:15:54,822
Tell me, who would look at the bottom
of car before driving?

1024
01:15:54,866 --> 01:15:58,962
What is it? What happened? Don't
quarrel

1025
01:15:59,338 --> 01:16:00,566
Sir Lung, you're right on time

1026
01:16:00,672 --> 01:16:01,969
This guy almost hit Lok

1027
01:16:04,943 --> 01:16:06,706
Luckily, it's just a few scratches only

1028
01:16:07,412 --> 01:16:08,003
Ming

1029
01:16:08,046 --> 01:16:08,774
Wing

1030
01:16:09,214 --> 01:16:09,873
Are you OK?

1031
01:16:10,449 --> 01:16:12,417
Wing, keep your eyes on Ming

1032
01:16:13,085 --> 01:16:14,609
You're not even doing the father's job

1033
01:16:16,321 --> 01:16:18,482
Everything is fine now

1034
01:16:19,458 --> 01:16:21,449
Hey, you've almost got me in trouble

1035
01:16:31,737 --> 01:16:32,999
Would you still dare to run around like
this

1036
01:16:33,939 --> 01:16:34,667
No

1037
01:16:38,243 --> 01:16:39,141
Would you dare not listening to me

1038
01:16:40,612 --> 01:16:41,374
No

1039
01:16:45,083 --> 01:16:45,879
lf ever l left you

1040
01:16:46,218 --> 01:16:48,243
would you dare following me?

1041
01:16:49,187 --> 01:16:49,710
Yes

1042
01:16:50,389 --> 01:16:50,980
Really?

1043
01:16:51,390 --> 01:16:51,822
Really

1044
01:16:52,858 --> 01:16:54,155
Do you know where Wing wants to go?

1045
01:16:55,227 --> 01:16:56,194
To the homes of the stars

1046
01:16:56,628 --> 01:16:57,526
Where's the home of the stars

1047
01:16:57,896 --> 01:16:58,385
There?

1048
01:16:58,764 --> 01:16:59,287
Yes

1049
01:16:59,598 --> 01:17:00,326
What's the name of that star?

1050
01:17:00,799 --> 01:17:01,265
l don't know

1051
01:17:01,700 --> 01:17:02,826
That is called BUULUU BUULUU star

1052
01:17:04,269 --> 01:17:04,894
What about that one?

1053
01:17:06,071 --> 01:17:07,402
That one is poo-poo star

1054
01:17:07,873 --> 01:17:09,363
So dirty

1055
01:17:12,177 --> 01:17:14,839
l'm telling you, that one over there

1056
01:17:15,013 --> 01:17:16,446
it's called Fartty star

1057
01:17:20,018 --> 01:17:20,609
What's that one?

1058
01:17:21,253 --> 01:17:23,050
Superman star

1059
01:17:23,488 --> 01:17:24,420
Superman star

1060
01:17:48,513 --> 01:17:50,845
Wing

1061
01:17:52,184 --> 01:17:53,515
He may be out

1062
01:17:53,852 --> 01:17:55,080
l'm/.,;'/.,;'/.,;' l'm sorry

1063
01:17:55,787 --> 01:17:56,617
You're so early

1064
01:18:00,058 --> 01:18:00,820
Please come in

1065
01:18:01,460 --> 01:18:02,859
Let me introduce

1066
01:18:03,295 --> 01:18:04,819
This is the representative from the
Education Department

1067
01:18:05,364 --> 01:18:07,389
This one's from Social Welfare

1068
01:18:07,799 --> 01:18:09,357
and this lady is from the District Office

1069
01:18:10,068 --> 01:18:11,194
l brought them here because they can

1070
01:18:11,603 --> 01:18:13,764
help you to apply for the Government aid
funds

1071
01:18:15,440 --> 01:18:17,305
They can also find a school for Ming

1072
01:18:17,809 --> 01:18:20,642
Miss, what was that you just mentioned?

1073
01:18:20,779 --> 01:18:22,110
Daily Living Aid for single family

1074
01:18:22,381 --> 01:18:23,040
That's it

1075
01:18:23,248 --> 01:18:24,180
But you got to be co-operative

1076
01:18:24,783 --> 01:18:25,272
What's your name?

1077
01:18:25,517 --> 01:18:26,040
Lee

1078
01:18:26,451 --> 01:18:27,145
Yes, Lee Siu Wing

1079
01:18:27,753 --> 01:18:29,277
Mr. Lee, how old is your son?

1080
01:18:29,488 --> 01:18:31,456
Four, just about to apply for school

1081
01:18:32,090 --> 01:18:33,216
What's your profession?

1082
01:18:33,492 --> 01:18:36,620
He's just a temp worker, no steady job

1083
01:18:36,728 --> 01:18:38,127
nor steady income

1084
01:18:38,864 --> 01:18:40,161
ls it him or you who is applying?

1085
01:18:41,066 --> 01:18:43,034
lt's him, l'm just helping

1086
01:18:44,069 --> 01:18:46,799
Mr. Lee, you should fundamental be
qualified

1087
01:18:46,938 --> 01:18:49,532
in addition to the kid's car accident
yesterday

1088
01:18:49,574 --> 01:18:52,042
you have a good case to appeal

1089
01:18:52,744 --> 01:18:53,676
please fill in all these forms first

1090
01:18:53,879 --> 01:18:54,971
You've got it wrong, l don't need any
help

1091
01:18:56,248 --> 01:18:58,307
l've got my hands and feet

1092
01:18:58,350 --> 01:18:59,214
l don't need any help

1093
01:19:00,051 --> 01:19:03,145
Even if you don't, Ming does

1094
01:19:03,622 --> 01:19:04,554
l've been thinking in your shoes

1095
01:19:04,623 --> 01:19:06,056
lt won't get you and Ming anywhere the
way you are

1096
01:19:07,325 --> 01:19:09,122
Of course you've the choice to reject our
help

1097
01:19:09,761 --> 01:19:11,820
but since we've opened the file

1098
01:19:11,863 --> 01:19:12,795
You have to fill in a rejection form

1099
01:19:12,831 --> 01:19:14,731
for our record

1100
01:19:14,866 --> 01:19:15,855
Good, let me have a copy of that form

1101
01:19:16,535 --> 01:19:17,797
How long have you been living in HK?

1102
01:19:18,703 --> 01:19:20,637
Does this child have a birth certificate?

1103
01:19:20,672 --> 01:19:21,434
l'd like to have a look

1104
01:19:22,674 --> 01:19:23,606
Hey, you people are so troublesome

1105
01:19:24,009 --> 01:19:26,603
For the sake of Ming

1106
01:19:26,845 --> 01:19:27,436
it's not trouble at all

1107
01:19:29,948 --> 01:19:30,573
Excuse me

1108
01:19:44,029 --> 01:19:44,757
Chan Kai Ming

1109
01:19:45,263 --> 01:19:45,888
l'm here

1110
01:19:46,498 --> 01:19:48,295
You're up

1111
01:19:49,501 --> 01:19:50,160
Did you wee-wee?

1112
01:19:50,502 --> 01:19:50,991
Not yet

1113
01:19:51,536 --> 01:19:53,800
Wee-wee first, you

1114
01:19:54,139 --> 01:19:54,764
Chan Chi Chiu

1115
01:19:56,074 --> 01:19:56,870
You're not his father

1116
01:19:58,944 --> 01:19:59,842
Adopted father

1117
01:20:00,745 --> 01:20:02,508
Where's your proof that you can adopt
this kid?

1118
01:20:07,686 --> 01:20:12,180
Read the back, it says clearly

1119
01:20:13,625 --> 01:20:14,387
He just picked him back

1120
01:20:15,994 --> 01:20:16,619
lt's clear

1121
01:20:17,128 --> 01:20:19,528
lllegal adoption, we've work to do here

1122
01:20:20,198 --> 01:20:21,529
What do you mean by illegal adoption

1123
01:20:22,267 --> 01:20:24,531
Didn't you say that you are going to help
him to apply for government aid?

1124
01:20:24,970 --> 01:20:26,597
And find a school for the child

1125
01:20:26,838 --> 01:20:27,532
That's another case

1126
01:20:28,673 --> 01:20:29,970
We have to deal with the legal matter
first

1127
01:20:30,842 --> 01:20:33,310
Colleagues, please prepare a report

1128
01:20:33,512 --> 01:20:34,672
have one cc to my senior

1129
01:20:35,046 --> 01:20:36,843
and then we'll decide whether we'll
charge this Mr. Lee here

1130
01:20:38,350 --> 01:20:39,942
Let's bring the kid to the Children
Protection Unit

1131
01:20:40,318 --> 01:20:40,943
Don't do this

1132
01:20:41,987 --> 01:20:43,045
What did you say? Don't you touch
the kid

1133
01:20:43,288 --> 01:20:43,947
You can't take him away

1134
01:20:44,523 --> 01:20:45,387
Don't stop us from work

1135
01:20:47,359 --> 01:20:48,621
You may apply to adopt him

1136
01:20:49,127 --> 01:20:50,424
come to my office and fill in a form

1137
01:20:50,562 --> 01:20:51,551
Go away, to hell with your office

1138
01:20:51,596 --> 01:20:52,460
Mr. Lee, please understand that we have

1139
01:20:52,497 --> 01:20:54,397
the right and responsibility to do this

1140
01:20:54,432 --> 01:20:55,694
We're just doing our job

1141
01:20:55,934 --> 01:20:57,128
Leave alone, l just want my kid back

1142
01:20:57,168 --> 01:20:58,032
Please calm down, Mr. Lee

1143
01:20:58,236 --> 01:20:58,964
Go away

1144
01:20:59,371 --> 01:21:00,599
Just suppose that l didn't approach you
guys

1145
01:21:01,773 --> 01:21:03,502
You'd better leave, you'll regret if you
don't

1146
01:21:03,875 --> 01:21:05,103
You can't give him a future

1147
01:21:05,410 --> 01:21:06,035
Why do you hit me?

1148
01:21:06,444 --> 01:21:07,877
Let's go, don't scare the child

1149
01:21:09,447 --> 01:21:10,675
Give me back the birth certificate

1150
01:21:12,417 --> 01:21:13,213
lf you have guts, don't go away

1151
01:21:13,718 --> 01:21:14,878
l'm not going anywhere, l'll wait for you

1152
01:21:15,520 --> 01:21:16,179
Go away, and stop talking

1153
01:21:17,889 --> 01:21:18,446
Don't be scared

1154
01:21:21,026 --> 01:21:23,085
Wing, l just wanted to help

1155
01:21:23,328 --> 01:21:23,885

1156
01:21:26,197 --> 01:21:27,129
l really wanted to help

1157
01:21:27,265 --> 01:21:27,856
Go away

1158
01:21:34,039 --> 01:21:36,098
l'd really meant to help

1159
01:21:38,710 --> 01:21:39,438
Police

1160
01:21:40,845 --> 01:21:41,869
Come with me, there's someone
kidnapping

1161
01:21:42,948 --> 01:21:44,210
Don't you dare to seize an officer

1162
01:21:44,449 --> 01:21:45,211
Show me your lD

1163
01:21:45,917 --> 01:21:47,942
Dear sir,

1164
01:21:48,520 --> 01:21:50,613
Go upstairs, faster, go

1165
01:21:54,159 --> 01:21:55,751
Ming, will you listen to me?

1166
01:21:56,027 --> 01:21:56,516
Yes

1167
01:21:57,529 --> 01:22:00,362
Do what l told you to do, go down to
Lan and wait for me there

1168
01:22:02,200 --> 01:22:03,098
lt may take a while when these people

1169
01:22:03,134 --> 01:22:03,998
bring me somewhere

1170
01:22:04,269 --> 01:22:05,395
l can't bring you there, do you understand

1171
01:22:05,604 --> 01:22:06,093
Understand

1172
01:22:07,772 --> 01:22:09,899
Also, don't tell anyone what happened

1173
01:22:10,308 --> 01:22:10,797
OK

1174
01:22:14,779 --> 01:22:15,404
Go now, Go

1175
01:22:19,584 --> 01:22:21,609
Hurry up

1176
01:22:30,095 --> 01:22:31,221
Bye, go

1177
01:22:36,801 --> 01:22:37,631
Open the door

1178
01:22:42,841 --> 01:22:44,468
Somebody is complaining that you are
illegally keeping Ming

1179
01:22:46,311 --> 01:22:47,073
Mind the head

1180
01:22:49,881 --> 01:22:50,870
Let's find the kid first

1181
01:22:53,785 --> 01:22:55,446
Ming is not your son?

1182
01:22:56,955 --> 01:22:59,685
Sir, don't just chat, we're here to work

1183
01:23:00,625 --> 01:23:02,650
Hey you, Can't you see that l'm
investigating

1184
01:23:03,695 --> 01:23:07,324
Lee Siu Wing, where is Chan Kai Ming
now? Ming?

1185
01:23:08,667 --> 01:23:09,463
He's scared by them, and ran away

1186
01:23:11,069 --> 01:23:11,933
You have scared him away

1187
01:23:13,171 --> 01:23:14,001
You may search for awhile

1188
01:23:14,572 --> 01:23:15,800
if you can't find him, then we'll have to
leave

1189
01:23:17,175 --> 01:23:20,542
lt's possible, How can such a small kid
run away so fast

1190
01:23:21,312 --> 01:23:22,210
We'll search carefully

1191
01:23:23,248 --> 01:23:24,647
Sir, is this how you called investigation?

1192
01:23:25,383 --> 01:23:26,077
Just like this?

1193
01:23:30,889 --> 01:23:32,288
l don't need you to tell me what to do

1194
01:23:34,559 --> 01:23:37,551
Wing, if you see Ming you'll inform this
officer here

1195
01:23:38,897 --> 01:23:40,888
Give him your card, he needs to contact
you

1196
01:23:41,633 --> 01:23:43,260
Let's make things easier

1197
01:23:43,468 --> 01:23:43,991
Sir

1198
01:23:44,169 --> 01:23:44,897
Now what?

1199
01:23:45,837 --> 01:23:47,702
l want to charge him for hurting me

1200
01:23:50,475 --> 01:23:51,271
l wanted a wound examination

1201
01:23:53,712 --> 01:23:54,804
Seems that he really dislikes you

1202
01:23:56,214 --> 01:23:57,203
Would you come with me to the Police
Station?

1203
01:23:58,249 --> 01:23:58,806
Let's go

1204
01:23:59,050 --> 01:23:59,709
Bring your lD

1205
01:24:05,924 --> 01:24:06,856
These young people nowadays

1206
01:24:07,158 --> 01:24:08,386
they just don't have any manner

1207
01:24:26,077 --> 01:24:27,101
Ming, what's up?

1208
01:24:27,812 --> 01:24:30,178
Wing asked me to wait for him here

1209
01:24:33,685 --> 01:24:35,016
Lan is very ill

1210
01:24:37,288 --> 01:24:40,121
Ming, ask Wing

1211
01:24:40,825 --> 01:24:42,554
To bring Sir Lung to see me

1212
01:24:47,232 --> 01:24:48,256
Ming, be good

1213
01:24:49,167 --> 01:24:50,191
listen to me

1214
01:24:51,703 --> 01:24:54,968
ask Wing to bring Sir Lung to see

1215
01:25:17,495 --> 01:25:19,486
There's no proof that he illegally adopted
the kid

1216
01:25:20,031 --> 01:25:22,556
Beside, his family didn't approach us for
help

1217
01:25:23,668 --> 01:25:24,896
Even now, the kid is missing

1218
01:25:25,870 --> 01:25:26,700
Give me some time

1219
01:25:27,405 --> 01:25:28,497
l'm sure l can find his parents

1220
01:25:29,174 --> 01:25:31,472
l can prove that he illegally adopted the
kid

1221
01:25:33,845 --> 01:25:34,573
You have to detain him

1222
01:25:37,048 --> 01:25:39,278
l want to charge him, he hit me

1223
01:25:41,920 --> 01:25:44,252
Lung, you'll do a report for him

1224
01:25:44,889 --> 01:25:46,151
He wanted to charge the guy for hitting
him

1225
01:25:46,658 --> 01:25:49,388
What? lt's just casual body contacts

1226
01:25:50,261 --> 01:25:52,092
You know these officers, you go and talk
to him

1227
01:25:54,065 --> 01:25:58,161
Officer, it's just casual body contacts

1228
01:25:58,736 --> 01:25:59,828
You're nor hurt

1229
01:26:00,505 --> 01:26:02,166
Just don't make a big thing out of it,
drop it

1230
01:26:03,341 --> 01:26:04,103
l can't

1231
01:26:04,876 --> 01:26:07,003
You know this kid may continuously be
ill treated

1232
01:26:08,880 --> 01:26:09,869
You're a policeman

1233
01:26:10,715 --> 01:26:11,875
you should know that prompt action is
needed

1234
01:26:12,851 --> 01:26:13,783
in order to help people?

1235
01:26:15,320 --> 01:26:16,947
You think you can really help
Chan Kai Ming?

1236
01:26:26,164 --> 01:26:28,189
l may be at home quite late tonight

1237
01:26:28,399 --> 01:26:30,094
Can you take care of Ming for me?

1238
01:26:30,368 --> 01:26:31,232
l'm Shanghai now

1239
01:26:33,304 --> 01:26:34,032
What about Lan?

1240
01:26:34,906 --> 01:26:37,500
Lan is ill,telephone no respond

1241
01:26:37,709 --> 01:26:39,074
Did something happen?

1242
01:26:39,811 --> 01:26:42,245
Nothing, it's Ok

1243
01:26:44,148 --> 01:26:45,615
well then, Bye

1244
01:26:45,950 --> 01:26:46,974
Bye then

1245
01:27:11,409 --> 01:27:14,242
Then l'll trust you to handle the charity
matters, Chairman Cheung

1246
01:27:21,920 --> 01:27:22,579
See you later

1247
01:27:32,964 --> 01:27:34,226
Stop ahead

1248
01:27:46,177 --> 01:27:46,836
Mrs. Leung

1249
01:27:47,345 --> 01:27:47,970
Wait a minute

1250
01:27:49,347 --> 01:27:50,006
Mrs. Leung

1251
01:28:04,295 --> 01:28:05,557
Do you know that child over there?

1252
01:28:07,065 --> 01:28:07,793
Leave me alone

1253
01:28:09,334 --> 01:28:10,528
What is it?

1254
01:28:10,568 --> 01:28:11,626
No matter what is the reason

1255
01:28:12,370 --> 01:28:14,668
if you leave someone who has your
same blood behind

1256
01:28:14,973 --> 01:28:16,304
you would regret for life

1257
01:28:20,078 --> 01:28:21,875
This is from my own experience, it's true

1258
01:29:31,682 --> 01:29:32,706
l don't know why, lvy

1259
01:29:33,718 --> 01:29:34,844
l'm really worried about Ming

1260
01:29:36,054 --> 01:29:37,612
Something must have happened

1261
01:29:38,122 --> 01:29:40,488
l think, l'll go back to HK tomorrow

1262
01:29:41,059 --> 01:29:42,287
What about your meeting with the Mayor

1263
01:29:42,493 --> 01:29:43,926
l'll make other arrangements

1264
01:29:45,496 --> 01:29:46,019
OK, let's go

1265
01:29:46,264 --> 01:29:46,730
Start the car

1266
01:29:52,904 --> 01:29:54,769
What is it? Ming?

1267
01:29:54,872 --> 01:29:57,397
Uncle Chan, did Wing call back?

1268
01:29:57,508 --> 01:29:58,065
What?

1269
01:29:59,177 --> 01:30:00,940
Nothing, nothing

1270
01:30:11,122 --> 01:30:15,252
Lan, Lan, did Wing call back?

1271
01:30:16,961 --> 01:30:19,828
Ming, be quiet,

1272
01:30:19,864 --> 01:30:22,332
Lan is sick, she needs to rest

1273
01:30:38,149 --> 01:30:39,980
Wing, can you hear me?

1274
01:30:43,721 --> 01:30:45,712
Where are you? Come back, Wing

1275

l forgot my clothes, Wing

1276

holding a 4 years old kid

1319
01:34:43,828 --> 01:34:45,693
last appearance, Causeway Bay

1320
01:34:47,098 --> 01:34:49,931
Don't say anything. Can't you see
that l'm busy?

1321
01:34:50,534 --> 01:34:52,399
Step aside, you're blocking my way

1322
01:34:53,337 --> 01:34:54,133
Go

1323
01:35:21,432 --> 01:35:23,400
Sir Lung, Sir Lung/.,;'/.,;'/.,;'

1324
01:35:23,734 --> 01:35:24,928
What is it?

1325
01:35:25,136 --> 01:35:26,797
You're here on time. lt's Lan

1326
01:35:28,439 --> 01:35:31,033
We are now waiting at the location
with ClD

1327
01:35:31,375 --> 01:35:34,276
we'll report with further information
Over

1328
01:35:35,679 --> 01:35:36,441
ls it this one?

1329
01:35:38,416 --> 01:35:39,678
Madam, what is it?

1330
01:35:40,050 --> 01:35:40,982
What happened?

1331
01:35:41,385 --> 01:35:43,353
Someone reported a child being
kidnapped here

1332
01:35:43,587 --> 01:35:44,212
Why are you here?

1333
01:35:44,488 --> 01:35:45,455
l've come to see a friend

1334
01:35:49,226 --> 01:35:50,989
May l take a look at the birth certificate

1335
01:35:57,401 --> 01:36:00,302
304267, 2 in bracket

1336
01:36:02,640 --> 01:36:03,402
Wong Mei Lan

1337
01:36:04,308 --> 01:36:06,538
female, 42 years old

1338
01:36:08,879 --> 01:36:11,643
nothing suspicious here, roger

1339
01:38:00,558 --> 01:38:01,286
ls it done?

1340
01:38:01,792 --> 01:38:02,383
Almost

1341
01:38:03,627 --> 01:38:05,356
OK, now let's count together

1342
01:38:05,729 --> 01:38:09,722
Five, four, three two one

1343
01:38:10,668 --> 01:38:11,396
There's nothing

1344
01:38:11,735 --> 01:38:13,999
What? Look carefully

1345
01:38:14,872 --> 01:38:16,430
Wow, a big burning cake

1346
01:38:18,442 --> 01:38:19,568
Which we can't eat

1347
01:38:20,010 --> 01:38:22,240
Here, you can eat this one

1348
01:38:24,214 --> 01:38:26,148
Next year, when l have money

1349
01:38:26,784 --> 01:38:27,944
l'll buy you a birthday cake as big as
that

1350
01:38:28,085 --> 01:38:29,382
which we can eat. All right?

1351
01:38:29,420 --> 01:38:30,011
All right

1352
01:38:30,054 --> 01:38:30,952
Let's have this one now

1353
01:38:30,988 --> 01:38:32,114
close your eyes, make a wish

1354
01:38:36,894 --> 01:38:37,861
Are you done? Ming?

1355
01:38:37,962 --> 01:38:38,587
Not yet

1356
01:38:39,830 --> 01:38:40,922
How many wishes have you got?

1357
01:38:41,832 --> 01:38:42,389
OK

1358
01:38:47,471 --> 01:38:48,403
Hey, what wish did you make?

1359
01:39:08,392 --> 01:39:09,051
Aren't you telling me?
Aren't you telling me?

1360
01:39:11,095 --> 01:39:13,495
Sir Lung

1361
01:39:16,133 --> 01:39:16,895
Ming, Happy Birthday

1362
01:39:21,205 --> 01:39:22,866
Lan has gone

1363
01:39:29,947 --> 01:39:30,936
Lan has gone to the other side of
the world

1364
01:39:31,949 --> 01:39:33,678
These few years, actually

1365
01:39:34,818 --> 01:39:38,117
l've been trying to find opportunities
to talk to her

1366
01:39:39,189 --> 01:39:39,780
but every time, we either ended up
getting nowhere, or quarreling

1367
01:39:40,858 --> 01:39:42,223
Such regrets

1368
01:39:46,530 --> 01:39:47,519
We didn't have even a chance
for hearty talk

1369
01:39:48,866 --> 01:39:50,493
How long have you known Lan?

1370
01:39:51,368 --> 01:39:53,199
We've quarreled for a few years

1371
01:39:56,740 --> 01:40:00,369
while l got this badge here

1372
01:40:09,119 --> 01:40:09,949
The first few years, l only dare watching
her from a distance

1373
01:40:13,023 --> 01:40:13,682
Life is so unpredictable

1374
01:40:15,092 --> 01:40:17,856
Let me tell you

1375
01:40:18,562 --> 01:40:19,187
l've applied to transfer to work
at another district

1376
01:40:21,031 --> 01:40:22,123
Why?

1377
01:40:23,033 --> 01:40:25,934
Lan is no longer here

1378
01:40:25,969 --> 01:40:26,663
l don't care about the order of
the area any more

1379
01:40:26,837 --> 01:40:27,861
What about us?

1380
01:40:30,307 --> 01:40:32,104
Yes, l'm selfish

1381
01:40:33,911 --> 01:40:35,572
For my whole life, l don't know
what l really like

1382
01:40:37,514 --> 01:40:38,503
and now, l don't even know
what to live for

1383
01:40:44,254 --> 01:40:45,346
For yourself

1384
01:40:46,790 --> 01:40:48,280
l don't know how to convince you

1385
01:40:52,229 --> 01:40:52,888
But there's always a tomorrow
after today

1386
01:40:57,301 --> 01:40:58,632
Think about it

1387
01:40:59,770 --> 01:41:00,964
lf everyone is like you

1388
01:41:04,241 --> 01:41:05,071
we'll have a happier world

1389
01:41:06,910 --> 01:41:08,138
You're right

1390
01:41:10,147 --> 01:41:12,081
There'll be fewer people committing
suicide

1391
01:41:12,983 --> 01:41:13,677
Educated person really talks differently

1392
01:41:16,587 --> 01:41:19,818
Of course

1393
01:41:20,991 --> 01:41:21,582
By the way, the whole police station
is looking for you

1394
01:41:22,993 --> 01:41:24,153
Why?

1395
01:41:25,295 --> 01:41:27,661
Do you remember, that lady?

1396
01:41:29,032 --> 01:41:30,624
The tall one, the one who's been
to your place?

1397
01:41:31,869 --> 01:41:33,359
She's the legitimate mother of Ming

1398
01:41:33,704 --> 01:41:34,898
Those writings behind the birth
certificate

1399
01:41:37,508 --> 01:41:38,304
she wrote them 4 years ago

1400
01:41:39,910 --> 01:41:42,310
Did she call the police?

1401
01:41:43,747 --> 01:41:45,078
No, it's that Welfare officer

1402
01:41:45,682 --> 01:41:50,847
He said he wanted to follow up the case

1403
01:42:00,531 --> 01:42:02,624
ln fact finding an excuse to get Ming
back to his mother

1404
01:42:05,202 --> 01:42:07,170
She left him behind 4 years ago

1405
01:42:08,305 --> 01:42:09,431
l know, l know you are very close
to Ming

1406
01:42:10,808 --> 01:42:11,832
Ming likes you a lot too

1407
01:42:12,376 --> 01:42:14,241
But when in the court

1408
01:42:16,513 --> 01:42:19,175
the priority is always with the mother

1409
01:42:19,650 --> 01:42:20,548
l don't know how to deal with these
complicated sentimental matters

1410
01:42:41,672 --> 01:42:43,970
Good luck

1411
01:42:45,742 --> 01:42:48,472
Although Ming is my own child

1412
01:42:49,780 --> 01:42:52,874
l don't know how to explain to him

1413
01:42:53,550 --> 01:42:54,380
that his mother left him behind

1414
01:43:00,490 --> 01:43:02,321
and didn't want him

1415
01:43:04,294 --> 01:43:05,693
To literally live with someone for 4 years

1416
01:43:09,499 --> 01:43:10,898
is not a short period

1417
01:43:13,437 --> 01:43:16,531
if l'm going to take Ming back now

1418
01:43:18,809 --> 01:43:20,242
l'm afraid that l might be hurting him
even more

1419
01:43:28,719 --> 01:43:30,744
l don't want to be wrong again

1420
01:43:30,787 --> 01:43:31,685
l've already arranged to have you
and Ming

1421
01:43:33,523 --> 01:43:36,549
What have you arranged?

1422
01:43:39,329 --> 01:43:41,559
You left him four years ago
said you had an excuse

1423
01:43:43,100 --> 01:43:44,533
but if you are going to leave him
again now

1424
01:43:50,974 --> 01:43:52,805
you are definitely inhuman

1425
01:43:58,382 --> 01:44:02,341
l have been living with Ming for
four years

1426
01:44:13,463 --> 01:44:15,192
but still , l am not his father

1427
01:44:15,632 --> 01:44:16,462
l think Ming will be happier to stay
with you

1428
01:44:29,446 --> 01:44:30,413
Much happier

1429
01:44:37,087 --> 01:44:44,550
You can do it

1430
01:45:25,802 --> 01:45:26,564
Think about it
Give me a ring then

1431
01:45:35,412 --> 01:45:36,504
lt's hot

1432
01:45:37,247 --> 01:45:39,807
lt's broken here

1433
01:45:40,417 --> 01:45:41,384
No, it's not. Eat

1434
01:45:42,552 --> 01:45:43,576
lt's broken

1435
01:45:43,620 --> 01:45:44,143
l thought you like sausages

1436
01:45:46,623 --> 01:45:48,614
l do

1437
01:45:48,992 --> 01:45:49,583
You're going to bring ''Short-sighted''
only?

1438
01:45:50,260 --> 01:45:52,285
What about ''lcy''?

1439
01:45:52,996 --> 01:45:53,724
''lcy'' will keep you company

1440
01:45:57,601 --> 01:45:58,625
Keep me company?

1441
01:46:04,141 --> 01:46:04,732
All right. Be careful, it's hot

1442
01:46:05,008 --> 01:46:05,599
Delicious?

1443
01:46:07,244 --> 01:46:07,801
Yes

1444
01:46:09,112 --> 01:46:10,739
lt's hot, did you boil it?

1445
01:46:11,882 --> 01:46:12,610
Listen

1446
01:46:13,050 --> 01:46:13,812
When you go to your mom's place

1447
01:46:14,184 --> 01:46:14,775
you have to be as good as you are here

1448
01:46:17,854 --> 01:46:18,445
l know

1449
01:46:18,622 --> 01:46:19,088
You really do?

1450
01:46:20,690 --> 01:46:21,384
Yep

1451
01:46:22,225 --> 01:46:22,691
Want some egg?

1452
01:46:30,133 --> 01:46:30,690
Want

1453
01:46:35,138 --> 01:46:35,866
lt's cold

1454
01:46:38,942 --> 01:46:39,601
l don't want it to burn you

1455
01:46:44,281 --> 01:46:46,715
Burn me?

1456
01:46:56,393 --> 01:46:56,950
Hurry up. When we finished eating
we'll go to wait for your mom, OK

1457
01:46:58,862 --> 01:46:59,954
Hold this

1458
01:47:02,399 --> 01:47:03,661
You! You just never tie your shoes

1459
01:47:04,501 --> 01:47:06,128
You have to learn to tie the shoestrings
properly

1460
01:47:29,793 --> 01:47:32,125
you're old enough to know how
Hear me?

1461
01:47:32,395 --> 01:47:32,918
This is the fish he likes. Call mom

1462
01:47:33,296 --> 01:47:34,024
Mom

1463
01:47:36,867 --> 01:47:37,697
My dear child

1464
01:47:42,072 --> 01:47:42,663
lt's getting dark, you'd better go

1465
01:48:06,696 --> 01:48:07,458
Ming

1466
01:48:08,598 --> 01:48:09,292
Keep in touch
