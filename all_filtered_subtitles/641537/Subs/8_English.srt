1
00:00:42,583 --> 00:00:44,208
[Rachel] I'm just
trying to understand why.

2
00:00:44,291 --> 00:00:46,250
[Dr. Grillo, on phone] You know why.

3
00:00:46,333 --> 00:00:50,000
-You didn't put in the effort.
-But... but I did, sir.

4
00:00:50,083 --> 00:00:52,125
All my course papers
were handed in on time

5
00:00:52,208 --> 00:00:55,000
my sources were listed,
but yet you still gave me an F.

6
00:00:55,666 --> 00:00:59,416
Rachel, I don't have to
justify the grade I gave you.

7
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:01,666
So that's it?

8
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:04,250
I'll have to carry over
the course next semester?

9
00:01:05,083 --> 00:01:07,791
Well, that's entirely up to you.

10
00:01:09,166 --> 00:01:10,500
Meaning what?

11
00:01:11,416 --> 00:01:12,750
It's unofficial.

12
00:01:12,833 --> 00:01:15,333
I haven't handed in
the grades to the faculty yet.

13
00:01:16,333 --> 00:01:19,458
Then, sir, you can please take
another look at my paper and reconsider.

14
00:01:20,583 --> 00:01:21,708
Please.

15
00:01:22,375 --> 00:01:23,458
Maybe.

16
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:26,000
Dr. Grillo, what can I--

17
00:01:26,083 --> 00:01:27,833
Don't mention my name!

18
00:01:29,041 --> 00:01:30,500
Why did you mention my name?

19
00:01:30,583 --> 00:01:34,250
I'm sorry, sir. Please.
I can't take another semester

20
00:01:34,333 --> 00:01:36,208
just because of an elective course.

21
00:01:36,291 --> 00:01:37,708
Please help me.

22
00:01:37,791 --> 00:01:39,250
Please.

23
00:01:39,333 --> 00:01:41,541
You'll have to help me

24
00:01:41,625 --> 00:01:43,083
to help you.

25
00:01:43,166 --> 00:01:46,583
I... I don't understand.

26
00:01:47,208 --> 00:01:49,041
Okay. No problem.

27
00:01:49,791 --> 00:01:51,666
Wait, hold on, sir!

28
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:55,166
Sir? Are you there? Sir?

29
00:01:56,291 --> 00:02:00,416
-Dr. Grillo?
-Stop mentioning my name.

30
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:04,333
I'm sorry, sir,
but please help me. Please.

31
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:06,791
Rachel, I don't have time for this.

32
00:02:07,958 --> 00:02:09,833
No, no, no, sir,
please don't cut the call.

33
00:02:11,958 --> 00:02:14,333
Are you ready to do
the needful? Yes or no?

34
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:19,625
[sighs]

35
00:02:19,708 --> 00:02:21,375
What do I need to do?

36
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:24,208
The Sunrise Motel.

37
00:02:25,958 --> 00:02:29,000
-I know it.
-Tomorrow.

38
00:02:29,083 --> 00:02:32,000
6pm. Go and pay for a room there.

39
00:02:32,083 --> 00:02:33,916
-Then call me.
-Jesus!

40
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,416
Really?

41
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:39,375
Otherwise I hand in
the grade as it is. Finito!

42
00:02:39,458 --> 00:02:41,041
[line goes dead]

43
00:02:50,833 --> 00:02:52,291
[Students ranting]

44
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:30,291
Gentlemen, wait, wait!

45
00:03:30,375 --> 00:03:32,541
This is the last act
you'll do in this university.

46
00:03:32,625 --> 00:03:34,125
I am a Christian.

47
00:03:34,208 --> 00:03:35,708
Ahh! Apostle.

48
00:03:35,791 --> 00:03:36,791
Carry him!

49
00:04:06,708 --> 00:04:09,041
[crowd screaming]

50
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,416
Meaning you could have chosen a path

51
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:20,791
far less destructive
and consequential than

52
00:04:20,875 --> 00:04:23,916
that taken by you.

53
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:30,625
This university has a
forum for airing such grievances

54
00:04:30,708 --> 00:04:34,125
but you ignored that platform

55
00:04:34,208 --> 00:04:35,750
to take

56
00:04:35,833 --> 00:04:38,791
to the option of being the jury and...

57
00:04:38,875 --> 00:04:40,875
uh, judge...

58
00:04:41,708 --> 00:04:46,250
in a complaint that had not
been brought before the senate.

59
00:04:55,833 --> 00:04:58,750
That arbitrary decision

60
00:05:00,208 --> 00:05:02,833
has resulted in a loss of life.

61
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:07,791
That is a matter for the judiciary

62
00:05:08,458 --> 00:05:11,291
outside this citadel of higher learning

63
00:05:11,916 --> 00:05:13,750
to deliberate upon.

64
00:05:14,916 --> 00:05:18,541
But as far as this
institution is concerned,

65
00:05:20,291 --> 00:05:22,166
all three of you,

66
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:25,041
including the one that ran away,

67
00:05:26,541 --> 00:05:30,333
are hereby rusticated from the university.

68
00:05:31,833 --> 00:05:36,166
Your academic records are henceforth

69
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:39,083
expunged in their entirety.

70
00:05:40,208 --> 00:05:41,666
That is our ruling.

71
00:07:03,583 --> 00:07:05,000
[Kwesi] No, no, no.

72
00:07:05,083 --> 00:07:07,000
Wait, Remi.

73
00:07:07,083 --> 00:07:10,500
Hold on, look,
you're not even 21 years old yet.

74
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:12,625
[Gloria] Would you
leave the poor girl alone?

75
00:07:12,708 --> 00:07:14,666
What is your problem?
Why are you hounding her?

76
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:16,458
[Pidgin] Are you the
one paying her school fees?

77
00:07:16,541 --> 00:07:18,000
It's okay, Gloria.

78
00:07:18,083 --> 00:07:20,166
If I had one naira for every time

79
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:22,166
someone was amazed by how young I am

80
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:25,208
I'd be a millionaire in dollars by now.

81
00:07:25,291 --> 00:07:27,500
Just 20 and you're
already sitting for your Masters?

82
00:07:27,583 --> 00:07:28,916
Hmm. Hmm-mm.

83
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I was still writing my
university entrance exams in Accra...

84
00:07:32,083 --> 00:07:33,208
-when I was 20.
-But that is the difference.

85
00:07:33,291 --> 00:07:34,916
[Ibibio] You are a dullard.

86
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,416
You know what I mean?
Like a compound dullard.

87
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:38,958
That's the difference.

88
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:40,916
What does "Nton" mean?

89
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,958
Charlie, don't worry, it means nothing.

90
00:07:43,041 --> 00:07:46,125
But you're just an amazingly,
intelligent young man.

91
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:50,166
Anyway, age is a question
of mind over matter.

92
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:52,250
-Tell him.
-If you don't mind,

93
00:07:52,333 --> 00:07:54,125
it does not matter.

94
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,250
-Philosophy 101.
-Come on, come on.

95
00:08:11,916 --> 00:08:14,166
-[sighs]
-Oh, no!

96
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:16,166
Professor Osagie!

97
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:18,208
-I hope he's not taking this course.
-Why?

98
00:08:18,291 --> 00:08:21,916
Well, he lectured in Ghana
during my bachelor's degree.

99
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,541
The man is stingy with grades.

100
00:08:24,625 --> 00:08:26,958
In my whole four years as an undergraduate

101
00:08:27,041 --> 00:08:29,291
I never saw that man smile once.

102
00:08:29,375 --> 00:08:32,708
Um... Good morning, class.

103
00:08:32,791 --> 00:08:35,166
Good morning, sir.

104
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:36,291
Um...

105
00:08:36,375 --> 00:08:38,708
For those of you who don't know me...

106
00:08:38,791 --> 00:08:40,208
I do.

107
00:08:40,291 --> 00:08:42,750
...I am Professor Osagie,

108
00:08:43,791 --> 00:08:46,833
dean, postgraduate college.

109
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:50,250
Scholars...

110
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:53,583
we are in the presence of...

111
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:55,208
academic royalty.

112
00:08:58,291 --> 00:08:59,375
He graduated...

113
00:08:59,458 --> 00:09:02,375
a first-class honors degree

114
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:04,000
in social science...

115
00:09:05,083 --> 00:09:07,666
from the Sorbonne University in Paris...

116
00:09:08,416 --> 00:09:10,958
at a tender age of seventeen.

117
00:09:11,041 --> 00:09:13,333
[students murmuring]

118
00:09:13,416 --> 00:09:16,416
-At seventeen?
-He then polished off a PhD...

119
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:18,708
-Sound familiar?
-...in Humanities

120
00:09:18,791 --> 00:09:21,500
at Harvard University.

121
00:09:22,708 --> 00:09:26,083
Having lectured in
various higher institutions,

122
00:09:26,166 --> 00:09:27,750
he was appointed...

123
00:09:28,583 --> 00:09:33,458
as a special envoy in conflict zones
in Sudan

124
00:09:33,541 --> 00:09:37,625
and Iraq by the United Nations.

125
00:09:37,708 --> 00:09:41,541
We are therefore indeed honored

126
00:09:41,625 --> 00:09:44,458
to have him in this institution

127
00:09:44,541 --> 00:09:46,458
as your...

128
00:09:46,541 --> 00:09:49,291
senior course supervisor...

129
00:09:49,375 --> 00:09:53,875
for your master's degree programs.

130
00:09:56,416 --> 00:09:58,833
Professor Lucien N'Dyare.

131
00:10:08,583 --> 00:10:10,833
My, my, my!

132
00:10:10,916 --> 00:10:13,041
After this type of introduction,

133
00:10:13,125 --> 00:10:16,625
I feel like I should just stand here
and pose for photographs.

134
00:10:16,708 --> 00:10:19,291
[students laughing]

135
00:10:19,375 --> 00:10:21,375
Wow.

136
00:10:21,458 --> 00:10:23,041
I think I've just met

137
00:10:23,125 --> 00:10:24,791
the father of my unborn babies.

138
00:10:24,875 --> 00:10:26,750
Thank you very much, Professor.

139
00:10:26,833 --> 00:10:28,208
You are welcome.

140
00:10:29,333 --> 00:10:32,333
The dean is somewhat... correct,

141
00:10:32,416 --> 00:10:34,416
because I am from Senegal.

142
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:37,750
But my mother is from the Benin Republic

143
00:10:37,833 --> 00:10:41,416
and my maternal grandmother
is from Nigeria.

144
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:44,166
-Wow.
-I guess that makes me a Nigerian.

145
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:46,375
[students laughing]

146
00:10:51,291 --> 00:10:53,625
I am... looking forward...

147
00:10:53,708 --> 00:10:56,083
to embarking on
this journey with all of you.

148
00:10:56,166 --> 00:10:58,916
So I wish you the best of all,

149
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,083
the best of luck, and, um...

150
00:11:01,166 --> 00:11:03,208
thank you very much for having me.

151
00:11:06,083 --> 00:11:07,791
-Once again, you are welcome.
-Yes.

152
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:08,875
Thank you.

153
00:11:13,375 --> 00:11:15,541
-Excuse me, sir.
-Just a minute, sir.

154
00:11:15,625 --> 00:11:17,916
Please just a minute of your time.

155
00:11:20,208 --> 00:11:21,958
Just one question, please.

156
00:11:22,041 --> 00:11:23,708
Just one question.

157
00:11:23,791 --> 00:11:26,541
-Okay.
-Prof, why is there so much controversy

158
00:11:26,625 --> 00:11:28,916
surrounding the line of demarcation
between India and Pakistan?

159
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,750
Is China's rising dominance a sign

160
00:11:30,833 --> 00:11:33,458
that communism is
indeed now a coded password?

161
00:11:33,541 --> 00:11:36,125
The rise of xenophobia in South Africa,
why is it coming from the blacks

162
00:11:36,208 --> 00:11:38,125
whom we freed,
rather than coming from the whites

163
00:11:38,208 --> 00:11:40,500
whom we campaigned
against during apartheid?

164
00:11:40,583 --> 00:11:42,500
Are you single?

165
00:11:42,583 --> 00:11:45,125
[chuckles, sighs]

166
00:11:48,166 --> 00:11:50,833
-No, I'm married.
-Ouch.

167
00:11:50,916 --> 00:11:52,833
Your friend has no shame.

168
00:11:52,916 --> 00:11:55,916
She'll soon ask the learned fellow
to guess her bra size.

169
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Blessed with two children
who reside in Paris.

170
00:11:59,083 --> 00:12:03,375
Mr. Kwesi, come on. Everyone
is impressed with his credentials.

171
00:12:03,458 --> 00:12:07,333
Uh, the prof's credentials are
the last thing on Gloria's mind, trust me.

172
00:12:07,416 --> 00:12:09,875
Why don't you just ask her out already?

173
00:12:11,125 --> 00:12:12,958
It's pretty obvious you've been
crushing on Gloria

174
00:12:13,041 --> 00:12:15,000
-since forever.
- Yeah, right.

175
00:12:15,083 --> 00:12:16,375
[laughs]

176
00:12:16,458 --> 00:12:18,500
I see.

177
00:12:18,583 --> 00:12:21,583
but we can still, you know,
show you around.

178
00:12:21,666 --> 00:12:23,375
So regarding your question,

179
00:12:23,458 --> 00:12:26,791
India-Pakistan situation
is extremely complex...

180
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:30,208
What?

181
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:32,250
Look, I was only trying to see
if I could gather some,

182
00:12:32,333 --> 00:12:34,000
you know, extra classes.

183
00:12:34,083 --> 00:12:35,708
Sure.

184
00:12:35,791 --> 00:12:37,833
Look, let's go, girl.

185
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:19,666
[whistle blows]

186
00:14:32,666 --> 00:14:34,791
-[instructor calling out]
-[students replying]

187
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:53,041
Good class, everybody. One minute break.

188
00:14:53,125 --> 00:14:54,500
Gather round together.

189
00:14:54,583 --> 00:14:56,750
Okay, so that's how it should be...

190
00:15:01,875 --> 00:15:03,708
Girl! You have to take it easy on me.

191
00:15:03,791 --> 00:15:05,750
Auntie, fetch the ball.

192
00:15:05,833 --> 00:15:07,625
So now this is my turn to serve.

193
00:15:07,708 --> 00:15:09,958
-Serve.
-Okay, here we go.

194
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:18,041
Yes!

195
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:19,208
That's a smash.

196
00:15:19,291 --> 00:15:20,625
Go get the ball.

197
00:15:32,541 --> 00:15:35,750
-Hey. What's up?
-My ball?

198
00:15:37,041 --> 00:15:38,750
Looking for this, huh?

199
00:15:42,041 --> 00:15:43,666
My name is Koyejo.

200
00:15:44,666 --> 00:15:46,083
Final year. Med school.

201
00:15:47,208 --> 00:15:49,791
And over there is my brother.

202
00:15:49,875 --> 00:15:53,000
He's a lecturer and he's into basketball.

203
00:15:53,083 --> 00:15:54,791
[Yoruba] My elder brother.

204
00:16:00,833 --> 00:16:02,375
So what's your name?

205
00:16:03,708 --> 00:16:06,000
-Moremi.
-Oh, my goodness.

206
00:16:06,083 --> 00:16:09,416
Bloody Jambites.
I'm not asking for your hall of residence.

207
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:10,916
I'm asking for your name.

208
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,500
[Yoruba] My name is Moremi.

209
00:16:15,083 --> 00:16:17,125
-The ball?
-What?

210
00:16:19,291 --> 00:16:21,291
[Yoruba] So you can speak Yoruba? Huh?

211
00:16:21,375 --> 00:16:23,333
You are saying it like
you are speaking Egun dialect.

212
00:16:23,416 --> 00:16:25,041
[laughs]

213
00:16:27,041 --> 00:16:28,458
My ball.

214
00:16:29,416 --> 00:16:33,791
-Where were you during freshers week?
-Moremi!

215
00:16:33,875 --> 00:16:36,208
-What's going on?
-I'm coming.

216
00:16:36,291 --> 00:16:38,375
Where were you? Hmm?

217
00:16:38,458 --> 00:16:41,250
What were you looking for
during freshers week?

218
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:42,958
-[English] The ball?
-Okay.

219
00:16:43,041 --> 00:16:45,000
[English] Somebody's got attitude.

220
00:16:45,083 --> 00:16:46,875
-[Pidgin] Take.
-Thanks.

221
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:52,791
Okay.

222
00:16:54,375 --> 00:16:55,750
So what does Jackie Chan want?

223
00:16:55,833 --> 00:16:58,333
-Serve.
-Really, you're not going to tell me?

224
00:16:58,416 --> 00:17:02,458
The social and economic
ramifications of a political process

225
00:17:02,541 --> 00:17:04,208
that does not include...

226
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,750
the will of the citizenry...

227
00:17:07,708 --> 00:17:09,791
will always conclude in a conundrum.

228
00:17:12,833 --> 00:17:17,125
Leading to the breakdown
of that very political process...

229
00:17:18,791 --> 00:17:22,208
that spur the extremity
in the first place.

230
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:25,875
Now, a perfect example

231
00:17:25,958 --> 00:17:31,208
is the 1956 British handling
of the Suez crisis.

232
00:17:31,291 --> 00:17:35,708
Yes, they brought down the government
of the Prime Minister Anthony Eden.

233
00:17:35,791 --> 00:17:38,416
But at the same time,

234
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:42,833
they turned Egypt's Colonel Nasser
into a hero.

235
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:49,000
The British were simply
protecting their neo-colonial interest.

236
00:17:50,875 --> 00:17:55,041
They did not take into account
the social and economic will

237
00:17:55,125 --> 00:17:57,625
of a group of people
who just had enough...

238
00:17:58,458 --> 00:18:00,333
of the British interference...

239
00:18:01,291 --> 00:18:04,708
in their internal affairs.

240
00:18:04,791 --> 00:18:07,125
That's your toaster out there.

241
00:18:08,375 --> 00:18:09,583
Now...

242
00:18:10,833 --> 00:18:14,291
the Suez crisis became a clarion call...

243
00:18:15,916 --> 00:18:18,583
a reference point to the rest of Africa...

244
00:18:19,541 --> 00:18:23,125
still under colonial rule.

245
00:18:24,875 --> 00:18:27,166
I can't... [chuckles] No, no.

246
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:28,458
[French] Excuse me.

247
00:18:28,541 --> 00:18:30,958
Kwesi, everybody...

248
00:18:32,333 --> 00:18:35,833
I hope that you are not
just quoting me verbatim?

249
00:18:38,541 --> 00:18:40,916
This is a master's degree program.

250
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,500
I don't want you to just lap it all up.

251
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,416
I want you to analyze it,

252
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:50,333
disagree with it, even.

253
00:18:50,416 --> 00:18:52,250
This is not dogma.

254
00:18:53,041 --> 00:18:54,375
Ehnn?

255
00:18:54,458 --> 00:18:57,625
This is an intellectual discourse.

256
00:18:57,708 --> 00:18:58,958
We are all learning here.

257
00:18:59,041 --> 00:19:03,375
Well, the only difference is that
I am being paid.

258
00:19:03,458 --> 00:19:05,416
[students laughing]

259
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:10,916
All right, now
I've divided the class into...

260
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,458
five tutorial groups.

261
00:19:13,708 --> 00:19:15,791
One over which I will preside,

262
00:19:15,875 --> 00:19:20,416
and the rest will be shared
amongst the other lecturers.

263
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:23,041
So please come up
and see what group you belong to.

264
00:19:30,541 --> 00:19:32,916
-Why is she so excited about everything?
-Moremi!

265
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,500
Okay, I will catch up with you guys.

266
00:19:36,583 --> 00:19:38,333
[sighs]

267
00:19:38,416 --> 00:19:41,208
[Yoruba] Yeah, how can I help you?

268
00:19:46,541 --> 00:19:48,416
First of all, hmm...

269
00:19:49,291 --> 00:19:51,291
I'm legit sorry.

270
00:19:51,375 --> 00:19:53,083
Okay?

271
00:19:53,166 --> 00:19:55,291
I swear down.

272
00:19:55,375 --> 00:19:57,541
I have been searching for you.

273
00:19:57,625 --> 00:19:59,750
I have looked everywhere for you.
I went to every department,

274
00:19:59,833 --> 00:20:03,416
every faculty, even every cafeteria.

275
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:06,208
And then it dawned on me.

276
00:20:06,291 --> 00:20:08,958
What if this girl is not
even an undergraduate?

277
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:11,375
What if she's postgraduate?

278
00:20:11,458 --> 00:20:14,250
God, as if the ground should
open up and swallow me.

279
00:20:14,333 --> 00:20:16,208
I swear, I'm sorry.

280
00:20:16,291 --> 00:20:18,333
No need.

281
00:20:18,416 --> 00:20:21,541
I'd push you in myself.

282
00:20:21,625 --> 00:20:27,083
Mister "I'm Koyejo.
Final year Med School."

283
00:20:27,166 --> 00:20:28,500
She got me.

284
00:20:28,583 --> 00:20:32,416
Will you ever forget that scenario?
Will you ever?

285
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:34,250
Eventually.

286
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:36,541
Hmm! Eventually?

287
00:20:36,625 --> 00:20:39,833
-Eventually? Okay, that means we're cool?
-Hmm.

288
00:20:39,916 --> 00:20:41,833
Do you still want me to
push you in that hole in the ground?

289
00:20:41,916 --> 00:20:44,791
Please, please don't be angry.
Don't push me into it.

290
00:20:44,875 --> 00:20:48,000
Don't push me into it.

291
00:20:53,166 --> 00:20:55,000
Can I...

292
00:20:56,166 --> 00:20:57,916
have your number?

293
00:20:59,416 --> 00:21:00,916
Please?

294
00:21:12,833 --> 00:21:15,166
Not to worry. You'll be fine.

295
00:21:16,791 --> 00:21:18,833
Remember what I said.

296
00:21:18,916 --> 00:21:22,375
It's not like a court,
but a senate hearing

297
00:21:22,458 --> 00:21:23,958
carries a lot of weight.

298
00:21:24,041 --> 00:21:29,375
You are the complainant,
he is the respondent.

299
00:21:29,458 --> 00:21:32,625
Only the panel will
be allowed to ask questions.

300
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:35,458
I cannot address the panel.

301
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:38,916
Neither can I question the respondent,

302
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,458
nor the...

303
00:21:41,541 --> 00:21:44,083
um, witnesses.

304
00:21:44,166 --> 00:21:49,916
And same goes for the representation
of the respondent.

305
00:21:51,333 --> 00:21:54,625
But I will be allowed
to whisper advice to you.

306
00:21:54,708 --> 00:21:57,083
It's a closed hearing.

307
00:21:57,166 --> 00:21:59,708
That's why we didn't
bother to invite your parents.

308
00:22:01,916 --> 00:22:03,500
How are you holding up?

309
00:22:06,125 --> 00:22:08,541
Everyone on campus is staring at me.

310
00:22:13,333 --> 00:22:15,666
Your story has gone viral.

311
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:18,583
I don't want to read any of it.

312
00:22:18,666 --> 00:22:20,625
We need the noise.

313
00:22:20,708 --> 00:22:23,166
-[sighs]
-We need the publicity.

314
00:22:25,541 --> 00:22:27,791
I just want to stay in school,

315
00:22:27,875 --> 00:22:29,708
continue my studies.

316
00:22:32,625 --> 00:22:36,250
The Ajike Advocacy Centre

317
00:22:36,333 --> 00:22:40,875
hired me to give you
the best representation at this hearing.

318
00:22:42,666 --> 00:22:45,416
I promise to do that, hmm?

319
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:56,750
What happens if I lose?

320
00:22:58,750 --> 00:23:01,041
Do you remember the case of Dr. Grillo?

321
00:23:01,125 --> 00:23:03,250
A couple of years back?

322
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:07,625
No, you wouldn't. Your first degree
wasn't in Nigeria, was it?

323
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:11,708
Dr. Grillo was a university lecturer

324
00:23:11,791 --> 00:23:14,875
whose conversation with a female student

325
00:23:14,958 --> 00:23:18,375
demanding for sex
before he changed her grades

326
00:23:18,458 --> 00:23:20,541
was caught on tape.

327
00:23:21,625 --> 00:23:23,791
Now, instead of the female student

328
00:23:23,875 --> 00:23:27,250
to hand over to the university authorities

329
00:23:27,333 --> 00:23:29,541
the recorded conversation,

330
00:23:29,625 --> 00:23:34,666
her boyfriend decided to lay a trap
for Dr. Grillo in a local hotel.

331
00:23:36,791 --> 00:23:41,791
Suffice to say, the entire escapade
ended in a tragic death.

332
00:23:41,875 --> 00:23:47,250
And all the students involved,
including the female student in question,

333
00:23:47,333 --> 00:23:50,500
were expelled from this university.

334
00:23:50,583 --> 00:23:54,791
And they were then jailed
by a high court for manslaughter.

335
00:23:59,666 --> 00:24:03,666
So I could be rusticated too
for slandering a lecturer?

336
00:24:06,083 --> 00:24:08,250
At least you didn't kill him.

337
00:24:09,541 --> 00:24:10,916
Let's go.

338
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:17,666
I'd like to welcome everyone
to this committee meeting and...

339
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:20,416
first I'd like to introduce
every member of the panel

340
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:23,250
starting from Uzoamaka Chukwu,

341
00:24:23,333 --> 00:24:25,750
who is representing the student body.

342
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:28,958
And on my right is Professor Osagie,

343
00:24:29,041 --> 00:24:32,041
one of our highly respected deans.

344
00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:36,791
To my left is our dearest
Professor Yahaya.

345
00:24:38,041 --> 00:24:43,250
And Dr. Mrs. Nwosu. Thank you very much
for being part of the panel.

346
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:47,375
Obviously here is Miss Oluwa

347
00:24:47,458 --> 00:24:49,333
with her legal representation,

348
00:24:49,416 --> 00:24:53,333
and Professor Lucien
and his legal representation.

349
00:24:53,416 --> 00:24:56,125
And I have the privilege
to chair this session.

350
00:24:56,208 --> 00:24:58,458
My name is Professor Ibukun Awosika.

351
00:24:58,541 --> 00:25:01,458
So I'd like everyone to know that

352
00:25:01,541 --> 00:25:05,791
the entire proceeding will
be audio-recorded by the clerk

353
00:25:05,875 --> 00:25:07,208
who is sitting over there,

354
00:25:07,291 --> 00:25:11,583
so we'll have no dispute
about anybody's contribution.

355
00:25:11,666 --> 00:25:13,500
So, Miss Oluwa, shall we proceed?

356
00:25:19,125 --> 00:25:20,583
My, um...

357
00:25:22,708 --> 00:25:26,083
My first one-on-one contact
with Professor N'Dyare

358
00:25:26,166 --> 00:25:28,416
was after a tutorial class.

359
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:33,208
The political inclination of any nation
has the most profound impact

360
00:25:33,291 --> 00:25:35,875
on the foreign policy of that country,

361
00:25:35,958 --> 00:25:39,208
in terms of how it
deals with its neighbors.

362
00:25:39,291 --> 00:25:45,708
Now, Senegal and Gambia
are both capitalist by nature.

363
00:25:45,791 --> 00:25:50,958
Imagine that one nation
is a communist country

364
00:25:51,041 --> 00:25:53,500
with leanings towards Russia.

365
00:25:53,583 --> 00:25:58,250
And the other one was a capitalist economy
with leanings towards the west.

366
00:26:02,083 --> 00:26:03,875
Yes?

367
00:26:03,958 --> 00:26:07,166
I don't think it would make
any difference whatsoever.

368
00:26:08,041 --> 00:26:09,916
Sorry, I didn't get your name?

369
00:26:11,916 --> 00:26:13,791
Moremi Oluwa.

370
00:26:13,875 --> 00:26:15,541
Moremi.

371
00:26:15,625 --> 00:26:17,083
Moremi.

372
00:26:17,166 --> 00:26:18,750
During my tour of the campus,

373
00:26:18,833 --> 00:26:22,041
I saw a hall of residence
with the same name.

374
00:26:22,125 --> 00:26:24,625
The university named a hall
after you already?

375
00:26:24,708 --> 00:26:29,708
I mean you must be either
highly intelligent or highly connected.

376
00:26:30,708 --> 00:26:32,458
Just a mere coincidence, sir.

377
00:26:34,708 --> 00:26:36,541
All right, go on with your point.

378
00:26:37,541 --> 00:26:40,291
When it comes to African countries,

379
00:26:40,375 --> 00:26:42,583
culture is a strong determining factor,

380
00:26:42,666 --> 00:26:46,041
so Senegal is a former French colony,

381
00:26:46,125 --> 00:26:47,500
Gambia British,

382
00:26:47,583 --> 00:26:50,083
yet culture trumps ideology.

383
00:26:50,166 --> 00:26:52,958
It takes far more
than political inclinations

384
00:26:53,041 --> 00:26:55,041
to tear neighboring countries apart.

385
00:26:55,125 --> 00:26:58,583
What of Sudan and South Sudan,
always at loggerheads?

386
00:26:58,666 --> 00:27:01,916
Well, that was formerly one country.

387
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,125
Siblings disagree all the time.

388
00:27:07,958 --> 00:27:10,041
Just like North and South Korea.

389
00:27:12,125 --> 00:27:14,083
All right.

390
00:27:14,166 --> 00:27:16,000
Moving on...

391
00:27:17,958 --> 00:27:21,208
[French] This is just impossible,
I can't drive this car.

392
00:27:22,458 --> 00:27:24,125
What a mess.

393
00:27:24,208 --> 00:27:25,541
Professor N'Dyare?

394
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:31,083
-Moremi?
-[French] Having issues with your car?

395
00:27:32,583 --> 00:27:34,375
You speak French?

396
00:27:34,458 --> 00:27:37,708
Yes, I have a French
baccalaureate qualification.

397
00:27:39,041 --> 00:27:40,625
Did you take any electives

398
00:27:42,208 --> 00:27:43,291
in mechanical engineering?

399
00:27:44,791 --> 00:27:46,125
[laughs]

400
00:27:47,166 --> 00:27:48,291
[sighs]

401
00:27:51,291 --> 00:27:52,708
I must tell you...

402
00:27:55,708 --> 00:27:57,333
I don't want you to make fun of me.

403
00:27:57,958 --> 00:27:59,791
[English] I don't know how to drive stick.

404
00:28:00,375 --> 00:28:01,625
Excuse me?

405
00:28:02,333 --> 00:28:06,541
[French] I learnt how to drive in America
on an automatic gear shift.

406
00:28:06,625 --> 00:28:11,375
But this university
loaned me a car with a stick gear.

407
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:15,916
You mean you don't know how
to drive a car with a manual gear?

408
00:28:17,083 --> 00:28:18,583
Well... Stick.

409
00:28:19,791 --> 00:28:21,458
Your car key, sir?

410
00:28:23,166 --> 00:28:24,625
What do you intend doing?

411
00:28:30,708 --> 00:28:32,041
Shall we?

412
00:28:51,666 --> 00:28:53,208
Okay, Professor.

413
00:28:53,291 --> 00:28:56,916
I'm going to teach you how to
drive a manual gear shift automobile.

414
00:28:58,708 --> 00:29:00,125
Where are you heading to?

415
00:29:00,916 --> 00:29:03,208
-Road 8.
-Okay.

416
00:29:20,708 --> 00:29:22,875
Sir, you've got to understand...

417
00:29:23,875 --> 00:29:26,500
the gear ratio when driving manual.

418
00:29:28,041 --> 00:29:29,333
When driving stick.

419
00:29:29,416 --> 00:29:34,125
[Lucien] I think it's just
too much information and jargon.

420
00:29:34,208 --> 00:29:37,000
Automatic is much more easier.

421
00:29:37,083 --> 00:29:41,708
[Moremi] But with manual, you're
in control, the one in the driver seat.

422
00:29:41,791 --> 00:29:45,000
In an automatic, gear change is automated.

423
00:29:45,083 --> 00:29:47,625
[Lucien] l guess you like
to be in control. [laughs]

424
00:30:23,166 --> 00:30:24,666
Thank you so much.

425
00:30:24,750 --> 00:30:26,833
You're very welcome, sir.

426
00:30:26,916 --> 00:30:29,166
I might have to ask
the university for a driver,

427
00:30:29,250 --> 00:30:31,583
or get an automatic car instead.

428
00:30:31,666 --> 00:30:34,750
Just practice, it makes perfect.

429
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:37,583
If you continue to teach me,
then no problem.

430
00:30:43,333 --> 00:30:46,250
Please come in. The least I can do
is offer you a drink, some refreshments?

431
00:30:46,333 --> 00:30:49,916
That's okay, I was heading to
the supermarket when I ran into you.

432
00:30:50,916 --> 00:30:53,375
-But it's a long way from here.
-There's a bus stop around the corner.

433
00:30:53,458 --> 00:30:56,291
Ah. Okay. Well, thank you.

434
00:30:56,375 --> 00:30:57,875
Goodbye.

435
00:31:04,875 --> 00:31:06,333
Wow.

436
00:31:08,291 --> 00:31:10,041
-Excuse me?
-Sorry.

437
00:31:10,125 --> 00:31:11,541
Good.

438
00:31:11,625 --> 00:31:16,541
Um... Professor N'Dyare.

439
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:23,166
In your first account
of the same encounter,

440
00:31:25,208 --> 00:31:29,750
you declared that it was Miss Oluwa...

441
00:31:30,583 --> 00:31:36,250
who actually said to you
that she was coming into your residence.

442
00:31:36,333 --> 00:31:38,083
Is that correct?

443
00:31:40,833 --> 00:31:42,958
She said she had time to kill.

444
00:31:44,333 --> 00:31:45,708
And I...

445
00:31:46,916 --> 00:31:50,166
I told her it would be highly
inappropriate for me to invite her in.

446
00:31:52,625 --> 00:31:55,333
I thanked her for her service...

447
00:31:55,416 --> 00:31:56,958
and she left.

448
00:31:59,958 --> 00:32:01,125
Liar!

449
00:32:04,541 --> 00:32:07,458
Okay, as things
are getting a little heated

450
00:32:07,541 --> 00:32:11,125
I think it will be a good point for us
to take a break for lunch,

451
00:32:11,208 --> 00:32:16,250
and when we come back from lunch
we can pick up things and continue.

452
00:32:16,333 --> 00:32:19,000
Thank you very much for your time.

453
00:32:48,958 --> 00:32:50,958
A penny for them?

454
00:32:53,750 --> 00:32:55,375
The panel...

455
00:32:55,458 --> 00:32:58,083
I saw a lot of doubt on their faces today.

456
00:32:58,166 --> 00:33:01,541
Especially from my own dean,
Professor Osagie.

457
00:33:03,750 --> 00:33:06,041
Should I tell you how I met my husband?

458
00:33:10,291 --> 00:33:11,750
After law school,

459
00:33:11,833 --> 00:33:15,541
I was a junior associate in a law firm,

460
00:33:15,625 --> 00:33:20,541
and he was a senior partner
at the same firm.

461
00:33:21,791 --> 00:33:24,333
He asked me out three times

462
00:33:24,416 --> 00:33:27,541
before I finally agreed
to go on a date with him.

463
00:33:27,625 --> 00:33:30,250
We've been married now for... 21 years,

464
00:33:30,333 --> 00:33:34,416
have three adorable
but seriously troublesome children.

465
00:33:35,708 --> 00:33:37,583
My point is...

466
00:33:38,583 --> 00:33:42,708
He was my senior in the workplace.

467
00:33:42,791 --> 00:33:45,291
Now after the third time,

468
00:33:45,375 --> 00:33:49,458
would it not be considered harassment
in today's context?

469
00:33:51,541 --> 00:33:56,250
There's a thin line between
wooing and oppression,

470
00:33:56,333 --> 00:34:01,125
especially when one party
has power over the other.

471
00:34:03,250 --> 00:34:04,541
What we must do...

472
00:34:04,625 --> 00:34:09,166
is make sure that we erase the doubt
from the minds of the panel.

473
00:34:12,583 --> 00:34:15,708
I have to return these calls, okay?

474
00:34:24,250 --> 00:34:25,666
See you in there.

475
00:34:34,416 --> 00:34:36,000
Hey.

476
00:34:37,541 --> 00:34:39,916
Mr. Kwesi, you're a witness!

477
00:34:42,041 --> 00:34:43,958
You're not supposed to be talking to me.

478
00:34:44,041 --> 00:34:46,833
Yeah, right.
They should come and arrest me then.

479
00:34:50,250 --> 00:34:51,708
So how are you doing?

480
00:34:55,625 --> 00:34:57,833
Be careful you're not being used.

481
00:35:07,916 --> 00:35:10,083
You've become the poster girl
for every woman

482
00:35:10,166 --> 00:35:12,583
with a grudge against
a male lecturer on this campus.

483
00:35:14,833 --> 00:35:18,625
Yeah. They all think they can swim,

484
00:35:18,708 --> 00:35:20,250
until somebody drowns.

485
00:35:27,583 --> 00:35:29,416
Remi, I...

486
00:35:32,333 --> 00:35:36,458
Look, I shouldn't have left you alone
that night after the Easter party.

487
00:35:38,666 --> 00:35:39,833
I should have waited.

488
00:35:41,791 --> 00:35:43,416
Mr. Kwesi...

489
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:45,833
it's okay.

490
00:35:49,416 --> 00:35:52,166
All right, See you.

491
00:36:09,291 --> 00:36:11,083
[sobbing]

492
00:36:18,416 --> 00:36:22,583
And... well, that takes us back

493
00:36:22,666 --> 00:36:26,041
to the situation of the refugees.

494
00:36:26,125 --> 00:36:30,250
The refugees camp,
displaced person, IDP... All over.

495
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:35,208
We are not taking any questions.

496
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:40,250
And, in any case, for those of you who...

497
00:36:40,333 --> 00:36:43,500
have not yet understood,
or who are not following,

498
00:36:43,583 --> 00:36:47,541
please refer to my...

499
00:36:47,625 --> 00:36:51,833
page 12 and 14 of the materials.

500
00:36:51,916 --> 00:36:53,333
Some of you are in possession.

501
00:36:53,416 --> 00:36:56,250
I've given it out. You know how to get it.

502
00:36:56,333 --> 00:36:57,708
And then...

503
00:36:57,791 --> 00:37:01,500
now to the real situation
of international relations

504
00:37:01,583 --> 00:37:03,125
flashpoints all over the world.

505
00:37:03,916 --> 00:37:08,083
Let us... A situation
whereby a no-fly zone...

506
00:37:09,291 --> 00:37:12,791
has been established in an airspace.

507
00:37:12,875 --> 00:37:18,541
[Lucien] Hence, society tends to mirror
that which it reflects.

508
00:37:18,625 --> 00:37:21,375
Now, if we take any group of people

509
00:37:21,458 --> 00:37:25,000
and we ask them if they're happy
with the government they have,

510
00:37:25,083 --> 00:37:26,666
if they say no,

511
00:37:26,750 --> 00:37:30,208
chances are that they're living in
a society where freedom of speech

512
00:37:30,291 --> 00:37:33,041
is enshrined in the constitution.

513
00:37:34,208 --> 00:37:39,833
If they say yes, well, chance is
that it's a totalitarian society

514
00:37:39,916 --> 00:37:43,375
where fear is the order of the day.

515
00:37:43,458 --> 00:37:45,916
Now, in that scenario,

516
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:51,208
how does an arbitrator mediate
to the best interest of the party

517
00:37:51,291 --> 00:37:53,666
that brought the grievance to the table?

518
00:37:53,750 --> 00:37:55,208
-Yes, Kwesi?
-Sir,

519
00:37:55,291 --> 00:37:59,625
you don't mediate to the interest
of the party that brings the grievance.

520
00:37:59,708 --> 00:38:02,375
You mediate to the interest
of all parties concerned.

521
00:38:03,125 --> 00:38:05,916
Hmm. What if serving all parties

522
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:09,791
inadvertently put one country
at a disadvantage?

523
00:38:09,875 --> 00:38:14,541
Hmm. Well, sir, if anyone
had the answer to that brainteaser,

524
00:38:14,625 --> 00:38:18,041
-there would be peace in the Middle East.
-[laughter]

525
00:38:21,333 --> 00:38:23,291
Yes, Moremi?

526
00:38:23,375 --> 00:38:26,625
Somebody is going to
walk away unhappy regardless.

527
00:38:27,916 --> 00:38:32,583
What if hostilities are declared,
based on a failed resolution?

528
00:38:33,416 --> 00:38:38,291
Resolutions that lead to an escalation
of hostilities are not resolutions.

529
00:38:38,375 --> 00:38:40,500
They are proxy wars,

530
00:38:40,583 --> 00:38:44,500
fought under the guise of covert
economic and political interest.

531
00:38:44,583 --> 00:38:48,166
So you'd do away
with resolutions altogether?

532
00:38:48,250 --> 00:38:52,500
No, sir. I just wouldn't present
a resolution as one

533
00:38:52,583 --> 00:38:55,750
if it has no chance of resolving anything.

534
00:38:55,833 --> 00:38:59,458
Otherwise you'd have Rwanda
all over again.

535
00:38:59,541 --> 00:39:03,875
A situation in which
UN peacekeeping forces stood aside

536
00:39:03,958 --> 00:39:08,333
whilst up to a million people
were brutally massacred.

537
00:39:08,416 --> 00:39:10,458
That's not a resolution.

538
00:39:10,541 --> 00:39:12,166
That's genocide.

539
00:39:14,833 --> 00:39:18,583
All right.
Well, all I know is that jollof rice

540
00:39:18,666 --> 00:39:20,500
originated from Senegal.

541
00:39:20,583 --> 00:39:22,833
[students laughing]

542
00:39:22,916 --> 00:39:24,458
[Kwesi] Come on!

543
00:39:24,541 --> 00:39:27,333
Come on, jollof rice is from Ghana!

544
00:39:32,916 --> 00:39:34,458
All right, calm down!

545
00:39:35,625 --> 00:39:40,291
Calm down! Listen, Kwesi.
Nigerians will never agree with you.

546
00:39:42,541 --> 00:39:46,583
All right, so now let's look at
the aspect of human rights violations

547
00:39:46,666 --> 00:39:48,583
within the framework

548
00:39:48,666 --> 00:39:50,125
of a failed state.

549
00:39:50,208 --> 00:39:52,500
-Okay, all right.
-Yeah?

550
00:39:55,833 --> 00:39:59,291
[sighs] I don't know why
it keeps stalling.

551
00:39:59,375 --> 00:40:03,125
Calm down. You're pulling
your foot off the clutch too fast.

552
00:40:03,208 --> 00:40:09,083
There has to be a balance
between the accelerator and the clutch.

553
00:40:09,166 --> 00:40:12,791
There is no logic to this.
We have two legs. Why make three pedals?

554
00:40:12,875 --> 00:40:14,625
It is ridiculous.

555
00:40:14,708 --> 00:40:17,083
Listen, start the car again.

556
00:40:18,458 --> 00:40:22,916
The gear needs to be in Switzerland
before you start the ignition.

557
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,500
Switzerland?

558
00:40:24,583 --> 00:40:26,375
Neutral.

559
00:40:26,458 --> 00:40:29,041
Switzerland - neutral.

560
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,958
-Very funny.
-Okay.

561
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:38,458
Don't forget,
ease your foot off the clutch

562
00:40:38,541 --> 00:40:41,458
whilst gently pressing the accelerator.

563
00:40:41,541 --> 00:40:43,583
Slowly, okay, slowly.

564
00:40:44,791 --> 00:40:46,916
Perfect! Brilliant!

565
00:40:48,083 --> 00:40:50,250
Very good, Professor.

566
00:40:50,333 --> 00:40:52,125
Well done.

567
00:40:52,208 --> 00:40:56,458
Okay, now you're going
to shift it down into gear two.

568
00:40:56,541 --> 00:40:59,708
-Like this?
-Perfect, very good.

569
00:40:59,791 --> 00:41:02,416
-You're really getting the hang of it.
-That works.

570
00:41:04,833 --> 00:41:07,000
[laughter, indistinct chatter]

571
00:41:46,166 --> 00:41:49,375
I can see that you're now an expert.

572
00:41:50,916 --> 00:41:52,250
Thanks to you.

573
00:41:52,333 --> 00:41:54,583
You were very patient with me.

574
00:41:54,666 --> 00:41:56,833
-Thank you.
-My pleasure, sir.

575
00:41:57,708 --> 00:42:00,250
I love to resolve conflicts.

576
00:42:00,333 --> 00:42:03,500
Conflict?
Which conflict are we talking about?

577
00:42:04,708 --> 00:42:07,083
-There's no conflict.
-Sir...

578
00:42:07,166 --> 00:42:09,916
I think the gearbox of this car
would disagree with you.

579
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,625
[laughs]

580
00:42:15,375 --> 00:42:19,375
What was it like working at the UN?

581
00:42:19,458 --> 00:42:21,000
Working in UN?

582
00:42:21,083 --> 00:42:23,541
It's nice, but quite stressful.

583
00:42:23,625 --> 00:42:26,541
When you're working for a common goal,

584
00:42:26,625 --> 00:42:29,000
people would want
to frustrate your efforts.

585
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,625
For as long as I can remember,

586
00:42:32,708 --> 00:42:35,541
I've always dreamed of
working with the United Nations.

587
00:42:35,625 --> 00:42:37,250
You?

588
00:42:37,333 --> 00:42:41,125
Somehow I saw an academic in you.

589
00:42:41,208 --> 00:42:43,250
Well, first of all,

590
00:42:43,333 --> 00:42:46,166
my father is a retired diplomat.

591
00:42:46,250 --> 00:42:47,833
Then secondly...

592
00:42:56,416 --> 00:42:58,666
[Lucien] The Kevin Carter photograph.

593
00:42:58,750 --> 00:43:01,833
Sudan. 1993.

594
00:43:02,541 --> 00:43:04,583
-The famine.
-Mm-hmm.

595
00:43:05,708 --> 00:43:09,625
A vulture waiting for
an emaciated African child to die

596
00:43:09,708 --> 00:43:11,791
so that it can devour its remains.

597
00:43:11,875 --> 00:43:14,250
A photojournalist who could do nothing,

598
00:43:14,333 --> 00:43:17,583
but stood aside to
record the image for posterity.

599
00:43:18,708 --> 00:43:21,708
I first came across that photo
when I was 11 years old.

600
00:43:23,125 --> 00:43:24,791
It has haunted me ever since.

601
00:43:25,958 --> 00:43:28,833
It haunted the photographer, too.

602
00:43:28,916 --> 00:43:30,916
He committed suicide a year later.

603
00:43:33,333 --> 00:43:35,333
I vowed from that day

604
00:43:35,416 --> 00:43:37,208
to spend the rest of my life

605
00:43:37,291 --> 00:43:39,583
trying to make a difference
to the world at large.

606
00:43:39,666 --> 00:43:42,791
Like your namesake Moremi Ajasoro?

607
00:43:42,875 --> 00:43:44,375
[chuckles]

608
00:43:46,791 --> 00:43:48,666
You've read about her?

609
00:43:48,750 --> 00:43:50,833
Of course, I did my research.

610
00:43:50,916 --> 00:43:53,625
Infiltrated the ranks
of the Ugbo forest tribe,

611
00:43:55,041 --> 00:43:57,708
discovered their weakness, and...

612
00:43:59,291 --> 00:44:04,166
saved her people of Ile-Ife from invasion.

613
00:44:04,250 --> 00:44:06,083
She was quite the heroine.

614
00:44:08,250 --> 00:44:10,333
I can only aspire.

615
00:44:10,416 --> 00:44:13,041
We all aspire, my dear.

616
00:44:13,125 --> 00:44:17,625
But sometimes a prophet is without honor
only in his hometown.

617
00:44:23,750 --> 00:44:25,250
Would you like to take a walk?

618
00:44:26,333 --> 00:44:27,666
Yes.

619
00:44:52,458 --> 00:44:55,000
You and I, we are new-age rebels.

620
00:44:55,083 --> 00:44:57,208
Rebels with a cause.

621
00:44:58,291 --> 00:45:00,666
-We ruffle feathers.
-We roar.

622
00:45:01,708 --> 00:45:04,500
-Mansa Musa!
-Che Guevara!

623
00:45:04,583 --> 00:45:07,625
-Toussaint Louverture!
-Obafemi Awolowo!

624
00:45:07,708 --> 00:45:11,250
-Nelson Mandela!
-Kwame Nkrumah!

625
00:45:11,333 --> 00:45:13,083
Moremi Ajasoro!

626
00:45:18,375 --> 00:45:20,750
[Lucien] This absolutely beautiful.

627
00:45:20,833 --> 00:45:22,833
[Moremi] It's amazing, look at this.

628
00:45:22,916 --> 00:45:24,666
Well...

629
00:45:26,125 --> 00:45:29,291
Um... That might be...

630
00:45:30,208 --> 00:45:35,333
all for the day.
Please submit your term papers on time.

631
00:45:53,333 --> 00:45:54,875
Moremi!

632
00:45:54,958 --> 00:45:57,708
We were just talking about you.

633
00:45:57,791 --> 00:46:02,541
Listen, sister, we just want you to know
that if there's any help you require

634
00:46:02,625 --> 00:46:03,791
-we are here for you.
-Thank you.

635
00:46:03,875 --> 00:46:05,916
We know what you're going through,

636
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:09,125
and we salute you for taking
a stance for all the females on campus.

637
00:46:09,208 --> 00:46:12,458
That's why we've been distributing
these flyers all over campus.

638
00:46:12,541 --> 00:46:14,166
These sex-for-grades scandals must stop!

639
00:46:14,250 --> 00:46:16,375
I really appreciate this,
but I need to go.

640
00:46:16,458 --> 00:46:18,791
Remi, we are here for you always.

641
00:46:18,875 --> 00:46:20,500
We're your Ajike foot soldiers.

642
00:46:20,583 --> 00:46:23,291
-Anything you need, just holler.
-Thank you! Okay.

643
00:46:23,375 --> 00:46:25,416
[both]
We stand shoulder-to-shoulder with you

644
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:28,375
in the struggle against
oppression and victimization!

645
00:46:28,458 --> 00:46:29,541
Bye!

646
00:46:30,833 --> 00:46:33,000
Keep them! Spread the word!

647
00:46:55,333 --> 00:46:56,791
Gloria!

648
00:47:45,875 --> 00:47:50,416
[Gloria] Birthday girl with the sauce!

649
00:47:50,500 --> 00:47:51,750
Thank you.

650
00:47:53,791 --> 00:47:55,583
Hi, Gloria. Thank you.

651
00:47:55,666 --> 00:47:58,791
I didn't even want to make a big deal,
but Koyejo...

652
00:47:58,875 --> 00:48:00,458
-Hmm.
-Look...

653
00:48:00,541 --> 00:48:06,000
if lover boy decides to make
your 21st the hit event,

654
00:48:06,083 --> 00:48:09,250
what is your problem? Girl, chill.

655
00:48:09,333 --> 00:48:13,541
Well, to be honest, he's growing on me.

656
00:48:13,625 --> 00:48:16,458
Like I don't even know already!
I know that.

657
00:48:16,541 --> 00:48:18,291
Look, all I'm asking for is,

658
00:48:18,375 --> 00:48:21,583
I must be the one
to choose the uniformed color.

659
00:48:21,666 --> 00:48:24,208
-I have to choose the head tie.
-Head tie?

660
00:48:24,291 --> 00:48:27,333
There are a few things I need to achieve
in life before I walk down the aisle.

661
00:48:27,416 --> 00:48:30,125
Okay, like what exactly? Huh?

662
00:48:30,208 --> 00:48:33,291
Madam Secretary-General
for United Nations?

663
00:48:33,375 --> 00:48:35,583
I already know that.
Now tell me something else.

664
00:48:35,666 --> 00:48:37,750
Whatever, auntie.

665
00:48:37,833 --> 00:48:40,958
Anyway, you know Mr. Kwesi
is going to be there tonight.

666
00:48:41,041 --> 00:48:42,166
Mm-hmm.

667
00:48:42,916 --> 00:48:44,125
And so what?

668
00:48:44,208 --> 00:48:48,958
Well, Mr. Kwesi has been crushing
on a certain someone.

669
00:48:49,041 --> 00:48:50,666
Please, please, please.

670
00:48:50,750 --> 00:48:52,458
In case you have not noticed,

671
00:48:52,541 --> 00:48:54,416
I don't have time
for all those small boys.

672
00:48:54,500 --> 00:48:56,916
Wait! What small boy?

673
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,041
Look, babes...

674
00:49:01,125 --> 00:49:03,208
let me help you with that.

675
00:49:03,291 --> 00:49:05,416
You already know my stance.

676
00:49:05,500 --> 00:49:09,625
I have no time for all these
small boys on campus.

677
00:49:09,708 --> 00:49:12,666
As long as you are a guy
that is in this school,

678
00:49:12,750 --> 00:49:16,041
you are a small boy,
and I don't have time for that, baby girl.

679
00:49:16,125 --> 00:49:19,458
Wait, so Mr. Kwesi, who is 40 years old,

680
00:49:19,541 --> 00:49:22,250
worked for 10 years in Ghana
after his first degree,

681
00:49:22,333 --> 00:49:25,375
and then returned to school
for his PG is a small boy?

682
00:49:26,416 --> 00:49:30,250
Sweetheart, let me help you with that.

683
00:49:30,333 --> 00:49:33,375
But you know,
like I always told you, baby girl,

684
00:49:33,458 --> 00:49:37,000
but sugar, you've always
known my preference in men.

685
00:49:37,083 --> 00:49:39,083
I mean, I've never hidden it from you.

686
00:49:39,166 --> 00:49:40,625
I like men like...

687
00:49:40,708 --> 00:49:42,791
you know, Professor Lucien.

688
00:49:44,291 --> 00:49:45,375
Excuse me?

689
00:49:45,458 --> 00:49:48,000
He is my kind of man.

690
00:49:48,083 --> 00:49:51,000
Honey, he's mature, he's...

691
00:49:51,083 --> 00:49:53,833
He's my kind of man, and look, listen,

692
00:49:53,916 --> 00:49:58,416
this man has always had eyes on you, okay?

693
00:49:58,500 --> 00:50:01,833
I am not... I didn't even make the cut
for his tutorial classes,

694
00:50:01,916 --> 00:50:04,291
but you made it. Baby girl, come on now.

695
00:50:04,375 --> 00:50:07,625
Do it for your girl.
Hook a girl up now, girlfriend.

696
00:50:07,708 --> 00:50:09,916
-Gloria!
-Hook me up!

697
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,166
Gloria! Respect yourself.

698
00:50:16,166 --> 00:50:17,500
Okay.

699
00:50:17,583 --> 00:50:19,333
But you don't like the guy.

700
00:50:19,416 --> 00:50:21,875
I like him, so what's up with you?

701
00:50:21,958 --> 00:50:24,291
He's married. He's our lecturer.

702
00:50:24,375 --> 00:50:26,500
What does that even matter?

703
00:50:29,500 --> 00:50:30,541
Okay.

704
00:50:30,625 --> 00:50:34,666
I'm not even going to entertain this.
Come on, let's go.

705
00:50:34,750 --> 00:50:36,416
Baby girl, come on now.

706
00:50:36,500 --> 00:50:38,958
I can't even play with you. It was a joke.

707
00:50:39,041 --> 00:50:41,333
Please, I don't do lecturers.

708
00:50:41,416 --> 00:50:43,958
-Okay, okay, let's go.
-I don't do lecturers.

709
00:50:44,041 --> 00:50:45,083
-You already know that.
-Let's go.

710
00:50:45,166 --> 00:50:46,458
I was just playing with you.

711
00:50:46,541 --> 00:50:48,250
You're too "extra, please."

712
00:50:48,333 --> 00:50:50,375
[Koyejo] There you go.

713
00:50:50,458 --> 00:50:53,750
-Close those eyes, babes.
-[Moremi] Where are we going?

714
00:50:53,833 --> 00:50:54,958
Don't worry about it.

715
00:50:55,041 --> 00:50:56,833
So you don't know
the meaning of surprise again, huh?

716
00:50:56,916 --> 00:50:58,875
I understand surprise,
but this is too much.

717
00:50:58,958 --> 00:51:02,333
It's not.
It's not too much once it's Koyejo,

718
00:51:02,416 --> 00:51:04,583
and once it's for Moremi,

719
00:51:04,666 --> 00:51:06,166
-it's not too much
-Aw, babes.

720
00:51:06,250 --> 00:51:07,583
-Just take a step.
-Okay, okay.

721
00:51:07,666 --> 00:51:09,833
-One step at a time.
-Okay, okay.

722
00:51:09,916 --> 00:51:11,333
And then...

723
00:51:11,416 --> 00:51:14,583
-[♪ Happy Birthday To You plays]
-Oh, my God!

724
00:51:24,125 --> 00:51:25,833
-My pal!
-[Seun Kuti] My brother!

725
00:51:25,916 --> 00:51:27,416
-Thank you.
-How you doing?

726
00:51:27,500 --> 00:51:28,625
-Thank you so much.
-Thanks for coming out.

727
00:51:28,708 --> 00:51:30,166
-Happy birthday, Moremi.
-Thank you.

728
00:51:30,250 --> 00:51:31,916
You shall grow old and live long.

729
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:33,458
Fine girl, thanks for coming out.

730
00:51:33,541 --> 00:51:35,833
I'm such a fan.

731
00:51:35,916 --> 00:51:38,833
Charlie, hope you're enjoying Nigeria?

732
00:51:44,958 --> 00:51:47,000
Yetty, please bring the cake.

733
00:51:47,083 --> 00:51:48,958
Oh, my God!

734
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,500
I bought a cake for Remi.

735
00:51:52,583 --> 00:51:54,083
Have it.

736
00:51:54,166 --> 00:51:55,833
-Treat her well.
-Normal.

737
00:51:55,916 --> 00:51:57,083
You guys have fun tonight.

738
00:51:57,166 --> 00:51:58,416
-I will see you backstage.
-Thank you.

739
00:51:58,500 --> 00:52:00,875
-Enjoy.
-I hail.

740
00:52:00,958 --> 00:52:02,958
I'm your fan.

741
00:52:03,041 --> 00:52:05,458
I'm your fan.

742
00:52:07,166 --> 00:52:08,791
Wow!

743
00:52:08,875 --> 00:52:10,208
[Pidgin] It's amazing

744
00:52:10,291 --> 00:52:12,875
Boo, how do you manage to do that?

745
00:52:12,958 --> 00:52:14,041
I'm telling you!

746
00:52:14,125 --> 00:52:16,333
So I didn't tell you
Seun and I are cousins.

747
00:52:16,416 --> 00:52:17,750
Huh?

748
00:52:17,833 --> 00:52:20,500
Wait, so you are related to Fela?

749
00:52:20,583 --> 00:52:23,791
Uncle Fela?
Seun's mum and my mum they are sisters.

750
00:52:23,875 --> 00:52:26,375
Wait! For real, for real, for real?

751
00:52:27,625 --> 00:52:29,708
I'm just kidding.

752
00:52:29,791 --> 00:52:32,208
And to think that I almost believed him.

753
00:52:32,291 --> 00:52:33,666
You're a fool, do you know that?

754
00:52:33,750 --> 00:52:34,958
-You're a fool?
-I agree.

755
00:52:35,041 --> 00:52:36,708
What type of stunt, I mean...

756
00:52:36,791 --> 00:52:38,583
That was superb.

757
00:52:38,666 --> 00:52:40,375
Seun is my friend, anyways.

758
00:52:40,458 --> 00:52:43,250
You know, I met him through a friend,
so we've been like this ever since.

759
00:52:43,333 --> 00:52:46,041
But you're a big guy now. I trust you.

760
00:52:46,125 --> 00:52:47,625
-You delivered.
-You know now.

761
00:52:47,708 --> 00:52:49,291
Oh, my gosh.

762
00:52:49,375 --> 00:52:52,208
This has been my best birthday ever.

763
00:52:55,500 --> 00:52:56,958
Put it here.

764
00:52:59,916 --> 00:53:02,375
Mr. Man, don't even think it.

765
00:53:04,166 --> 00:53:07,291
Guys, where are we going to?
Let's go somewhere. Let's just go.

766
00:53:07,375 --> 00:53:09,833
[Seun Kuti and the Egypt 80 Band playing]

767
00:55:08,875 --> 00:55:10,958
Greatest Nigerian students!

768
00:55:11,041 --> 00:55:12,333
Great!

769
00:55:12,416 --> 00:55:15,375
Greatest, greatest Nigerian students!

770
00:55:15,458 --> 00:55:16,791
Great!

771
00:55:43,041 --> 00:55:44,583
Stop!

772
00:56:40,416 --> 00:56:43,958
So mostly, yeah,
at the tail end of the semester

773
00:56:44,041 --> 00:56:47,666
we're having this grading
in our karate listing.

774
00:56:47,750 --> 00:56:50,708
So I am finally going for my...

775
00:56:50,791 --> 00:56:53,083
My baby, my black belt.

776
00:56:53,166 --> 00:56:55,125
Like I even know what that means.

777
00:56:55,208 --> 00:56:57,416
[laughs]

778
00:56:57,500 --> 00:57:00,625
Okay, let me explain it to you.

779
00:57:00,708 --> 00:57:02,750
[Yoruba] You see, in karate...

780
00:57:03,750 --> 00:57:06,333
-there are different stages, understand?
-Mm-hmm.

781
00:57:06,416 --> 00:57:08,708
The first stage, as a beginner...

782
00:57:08,791 --> 00:57:10,291
-Yes.
-..you start with white belt.

783
00:57:10,375 --> 00:57:11,875
-Okay.
-Yeah.

784
00:57:11,958 --> 00:57:14,208
From white you move to yellow,

785
00:57:14,291 --> 00:57:16,250
from yellow you move to green,

786
00:57:16,333 --> 00:57:19,083
from green to blue from blue to brown,

787
00:57:19,166 --> 00:57:23,375
then finally the highest standard,
black belt.

788
00:57:23,458 --> 00:57:25,208
-Black belt.
-Yeah.

789
00:57:25,291 --> 00:57:27,708
Is it not all about fighting Chinese?

790
00:57:27,791 --> 00:57:29,166
[laughs]

791
00:57:29,250 --> 00:57:31,500
Wait, wait, wait.

792
00:57:31,583 --> 00:57:33,583
Besides, how do you even reconcile

793
00:57:33,666 --> 00:57:36,583
learning how to fight
and training to be a doctor?

794
00:57:37,708 --> 00:57:39,000
-Really?
-Yes.

795
00:57:39,083 --> 00:57:40,416
-Really?
-Yes, really.

796
00:57:40,500 --> 00:57:41,708
Okay, okay.

797
00:57:41,791 --> 00:57:45,750
Karate is not solely about
just fighting, are you listening?

798
00:57:45,833 --> 00:57:48,166
-It's more self-discipline.
-Okay.

799
00:57:48,250 --> 00:57:50,375
-Do you understand? And self-defense.
-Okay.

800
00:57:50,458 --> 00:57:52,875
Hmm. And... Um...

801
00:57:52,958 --> 00:57:56,041
Let me break it down, okay?

802
00:57:56,125 --> 00:57:58,333
Somebody is giving me
a stance to work with.

803
00:57:58,416 --> 00:58:00,083
-Aha!
-Where?

804
00:58:00,166 --> 00:58:01,541
-Let me give you a tip, yeah?
-Where?

805
00:58:01,625 --> 00:58:03,083
You want to learn about karate?

806
00:58:03,166 --> 00:58:05,250
-Don't worry, Jackie Chan!
-Wait.

807
00:58:05,333 --> 00:58:07,750
-No!
-Babe, this might come in handy now.

808
00:58:07,833 --> 00:58:09,875
-Okay.
-Calm down, let me show you.

809
00:58:09,958 --> 00:58:12,291
Let the master teach you
how to do this thing.

810
00:58:12,375 --> 00:58:14,583
Okay, take for instance, yeah?

811
00:58:14,666 --> 00:58:17,000
Imagine an assailant, yeah,

812
00:58:17,083 --> 00:58:19,541
-holding on to your hand this way.
-Yes.

813
00:58:19,625 --> 00:58:22,291
Your two hands and you can't
break free, you can't do nothing.

814
00:58:22,375 --> 00:58:24,333
Two things you can do. First one,

815
00:58:24,416 --> 00:58:27,625
either you break free by force
and run as fast as you can.

816
00:58:27,708 --> 00:58:31,291
Or you close in on the attack this way.

817
00:58:31,375 --> 00:58:34,625
Okay. [laughs]

818
00:58:34,708 --> 00:58:37,000
I hope you're not
using style to tap current.

819
00:58:37,083 --> 00:58:39,000
[chuckles] I am tapping?

820
00:58:39,083 --> 00:58:42,000
-Oh, my goodness.
-Yes.

821
00:58:42,083 --> 00:58:44,083
Will you be serious
with this thing please?

822
00:58:44,166 --> 00:58:46,500
-Okay.
-This thing might come in handy,

823
00:58:46,583 --> 00:58:48,500
and I am not joking about it. Please.

824
00:58:48,583 --> 00:58:52,333
You close in.
You have to pull him in or pull her in,

825
00:58:52,416 --> 00:58:54,958
or whatever the case is,
and use your knee cap.

826
00:58:55,041 --> 00:58:57,916
-Yes.
-Yes, and you hit him in the scrotum.

827
00:58:58,000 --> 00:58:59,833
-In the what?
-In the balls.

828
00:58:59,916 --> 00:59:01,791
-Jesus!
-Mm-hm.

829
00:59:02,958 --> 00:59:05,041
-Okay, okay, okay.
-You to want to try?

830
00:59:05,125 --> 00:59:06,541
Yeah, let's try, let's try again.

831
00:59:06,625 --> 00:59:08,291
Wait, calm down, okay?

832
00:59:08,375 --> 00:59:11,166
-Go on, try it.
-Okay.

833
00:59:12,791 --> 00:59:14,250
Moremi…

834
00:59:14,333 --> 00:59:16,458
-Relax.
-Relax what?

835
00:59:16,541 --> 00:59:19,416
-Relax.
-Don't damage my family planning?

836
00:59:19,500 --> 00:59:21,458
Okay, okay, okay.

837
00:59:21,541 --> 00:59:23,208
Okay, yeah.

838
00:59:24,041 --> 00:59:27,000
-Like this?
-Yeah, but a little harder.

839
00:59:27,083 --> 00:59:28,750
Okay. Like this?

840
00:59:28,833 --> 00:59:31,500
Babe, you're a witch. I'm not
doing this thing with you again.

841
00:59:31,583 --> 00:59:34,583
-You're not even taking this serious.
-Okay, okay, okay.

842
00:59:34,666 --> 00:59:37,125
-I saw you on Thursday
-Yes?

843
00:59:37,208 --> 00:59:41,291
-With your lecturer. You guys drove past.
-My course supervisor, yeah.

844
00:59:41,375 --> 00:59:44,208
-A lecturer?
-Yeah. Professor N'Dyare.

845
00:59:44,291 --> 00:59:46,583
He's here on
a foreign exchange attachment.

846
00:59:46,666 --> 00:59:48,416
He was actually at the show tonight.

847
00:59:53,250 --> 00:59:56,291
Seeing you with him like that...
Are you listening?

848
00:59:56,375 --> 00:59:57,875
I don't like it.

849
00:59:57,958 --> 01:00:00,416
I was just teaching
him how to drive manual.

850
01:00:00,500 --> 01:00:02,500
I don't like it.

851
01:00:02,583 --> 01:00:04,416
Okay.

852
01:00:04,500 --> 01:00:06,291
-No, you have to be careful.
-Okay, okay, okay.

853
01:00:07,541 --> 01:00:09,041
And I'm serious about this.

854
01:00:10,250 --> 01:00:15,166
You know how some men
see overfamiliarity as a green light.

855
01:00:15,250 --> 01:00:18,500
[sighs] Okay, I've heard you.

856
01:00:18,583 --> 01:00:21,875
-What is okay?
-Okay.

857
01:00:21,958 --> 01:00:24,208
Before you now say that,
I am jealous, yes.

858
01:00:24,291 --> 01:00:26,208
Yes, you're jealous, yes,
you're very jealous.

859
01:00:26,291 --> 01:00:28,916
So I need to say it, so that you know.

860
01:00:40,750 --> 01:00:43,166
[Lucien] I made her understand
that I was not in the business

861
01:00:43,250 --> 01:00:46,333
of securing jobs for
students after graduation.

862
01:00:49,541 --> 01:00:52,166
She was very charming, tenacious.

863
01:00:52,250 --> 01:00:56,458
I had no idea there was
an undercurrent to her modus operandi.

864
01:00:59,208 --> 01:01:02,333
Hence no immediate
cause for alarm at the time.

865
01:01:02,416 --> 01:01:03,875
[Prof. Yahaya] Hmm.

866
01:01:05,666 --> 01:01:07,041
Professor N'Dyare,

867
01:01:07,125 --> 01:01:11,333
and what eventually
raised the alarm bells for you?

868
01:01:12,166 --> 01:01:13,500
When Miss Oluwa...

869
01:01:14,458 --> 01:01:17,125
intimated that she was
prepared to do anything...

870
01:01:17,916 --> 01:01:20,333
as long as she'd get that referral.

871
01:01:21,750 --> 01:01:27,708
Aha! And how did Miss Oluwa
go about doing that to you?

872
01:01:30,291 --> 01:01:32,250
[whispering]

873
01:01:36,333 --> 01:01:38,333
By revealing that...

874
01:01:38,416 --> 01:01:41,958
she wanted to indulge me
in a sexual relationship.

875
01:01:46,750 --> 01:01:51,375
Sorry, she legit told you that?

876
01:01:52,541 --> 01:01:53,875
Yes.

877
01:01:55,166 --> 01:02:00,041
In a one-to-one
meeting we had at my office

878
01:02:01,250 --> 01:02:03,416
regards her dissertation.

879
01:02:09,583 --> 01:02:15,875
[Moremi, in French] I assumed
that if I had a presupposition

880
01:02:15,958 --> 01:02:20,708
I have to defend it
with research and citations.

881
01:02:20,791 --> 01:02:23,083
Yeah, with original content.

882
01:02:23,166 --> 01:02:28,916
I like your premise,
and your first chapter is excellent,

883
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:32,375
but for your chapter two and three
I am not so sure.

884
01:02:32,458 --> 01:02:34,291
It talks more of the situation
from a third party's point of view

885
01:02:34,375 --> 01:02:37,083
than it does from yours.
It's like, whose dissertation is this?

886
01:02:37,166 --> 01:02:41,375
Is it yours? Or your source?

887
01:02:41,458 --> 01:02:45,875
Aside from that,
let me hear your hypothesis.

888
01:02:45,958 --> 01:02:48,416
Take note of my comments in red.

889
01:02:50,708 --> 01:02:53,416
Okay, thank you, Professor.

890
01:02:53,500 --> 01:02:54,875
Professor?

891
01:02:54,958 --> 01:02:59,166
When it's just you and I together,
you can call me Lucien.

892
01:03:00,041 --> 01:03:04,416
I'm not entirely sure
that would be appropriate.

893
01:03:05,625 --> 01:03:07,333
But I insist.

894
01:03:08,541 --> 01:03:11,291
I'd rather maintain...

895
01:03:11,375 --> 01:03:12,583
the status quo.

896
01:03:16,458 --> 01:03:23,041
My old supervising professor at Harvard,
I called him David.

897
01:03:23,125 --> 01:03:26,708
That is America, this is Nigeria.

898
01:03:26,791 --> 01:03:29,250
And I am Lucien.

899
01:03:29,333 --> 01:03:31,833
And I am Nigerian.

900
01:03:31,916 --> 01:03:36,958
The moment I call someone
of your age difference

901
01:03:37,041 --> 01:03:39,708
by name...

902
01:03:39,791 --> 01:03:42,541
it means I have...

903
01:03:43,875 --> 01:03:45,583
I have stopped respecting you.

904
01:03:47,375 --> 01:03:51,208
Why are you always so defensive?

905
01:03:51,291 --> 01:03:55,375
You know, when you taught me
how to drive stick...

906
01:03:56,375 --> 01:03:58,083
you were very relaxed.

907
01:03:59,708 --> 01:04:01,875
I was the tutor then. In control.

908
01:04:01,958 --> 01:04:04,333
Mm-hmm, then relax.

909
01:04:07,916 --> 01:04:09,416
Do you have a boyfriend?

910
01:04:12,541 --> 01:04:13,750
Yes.

911
01:04:14,916 --> 01:04:18,500
-The medical student?
-How do you know?

912
01:04:20,750 --> 01:04:22,208
I know.

913
01:04:23,708 --> 01:04:27,000
And with your boyfriend,

914
01:04:27,083 --> 01:04:28,541
are you also in control?

915
01:04:31,250 --> 01:04:33,625
That's not something...

916
01:04:33,708 --> 01:04:35,166
I'm comfortable discussing with you.

917
01:04:35,250 --> 01:04:37,416
[laughs]

918
01:04:37,500 --> 01:04:40,250
So you can talk to me about
the economic effect of Brexit

919
01:04:40,333 --> 01:04:42,166
within the European Union,

920
01:04:42,250 --> 01:04:44,958
but your sex life is a no-go area?
Come on!

921
01:04:45,875 --> 01:04:47,583
So it is forbidden?

922
01:04:49,875 --> 01:04:51,958
Now you've really got me curious.

923
01:05:06,625 --> 01:05:08,958
I have a funny feeling that in bed

924
01:05:09,041 --> 01:05:10,750
you like riding horse.

925
01:05:15,208 --> 01:05:18,916
If that's all, I want to leave.

926
01:05:21,333 --> 01:05:23,458
That will be all.

927
01:05:36,791 --> 01:05:38,416
Moremi?

928
01:05:40,458 --> 01:05:43,791
My favorite color is red.

929
01:05:53,458 --> 01:05:57,250
In spite of my informing
Miss Oluwa that...

930
01:05:58,666 --> 01:06:02,208
I do not appreciate
any sexual advance from her...

931
01:06:05,791 --> 01:06:07,708
she pulled down her pants...

932
01:06:09,041 --> 01:06:12,875
and showed me a glimpse of her underwear.

933
01:06:12,958 --> 01:06:16,916
I was utterly shocked and embarrassed.

934
01:06:19,416 --> 01:06:23,458
Professor N'Dyare, after that incident,

935
01:06:23,541 --> 01:06:28,000
did you bring this matter to the attention
of the dean of postgraduate school?

936
01:06:29,583 --> 01:06:31,125
Unfortunately not.

937
01:06:32,458 --> 01:06:33,666
Why?

938
01:06:33,750 --> 01:06:39,500
I wished not to adversely affect
Miss Oluwa's coursework.

939
01:06:40,291 --> 01:06:44,250
And I thought she would get over
her infatuation with me

940
01:06:45,250 --> 01:06:46,541
in due course.

941
01:06:46,625 --> 01:06:49,333
And did she get over the infatuation?

942
01:06:49,416 --> 01:06:51,125
There was no infatuation.

943
01:06:52,041 --> 01:06:55,125
Miss Oluwa,
you will conduct yourself appropriately.

944
01:06:56,083 --> 01:06:59,916
-Yes, Professor N'Dyare?
-[sighs] For a while.

945
01:07:02,250 --> 01:07:08,083
And then my tutorial class
embarked upon a trip to Dakar.

946
01:07:47,583 --> 01:07:49,416
[Koyejo] Dakar?

947
01:07:49,500 --> 01:07:51,416
As in Senegal?

948
01:07:51,500 --> 01:07:54,166
[Moremi, in Yoruba] It's a field trip.

949
01:07:54,250 --> 01:07:57,458
It's part of my course requirements.

950
01:07:57,541 --> 01:08:00,833
Professor N'Dyare really had to pull
some strings to get the trip approved.

951
01:08:00,916 --> 01:08:02,166
[Koyejo] N'Dyare?

952
01:08:03,708 --> 01:08:06,000
Same lecturer who tried to
figure out your sexual preference?

953
01:08:06,083 --> 01:08:08,541
Come on,
it wasn't quite like that, Koyejo.

954
01:08:08,625 --> 01:08:12,708
Okay, you're the one who came
running to me with complaints.

955
01:08:12,791 --> 01:08:17,291
You told me Professor
was talking inappropriately,

956
01:08:17,375 --> 01:08:19,916
like he's been inappropriate with you.

957
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,500
Maybe I overreacted.

958
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,166
[Koyejo] Maybe you don't want to
read the writing on the wall.

959
01:08:28,125 --> 01:08:29,791
That was over a month ago,

960
01:08:29,875 --> 01:08:31,833
but everything's been cool since then.

961
01:08:31,916 --> 01:08:36,000
Remi, that man is on your case.

962
01:08:37,333 --> 01:08:40,333
It's okay, it's okay.
Don't worry, it's okay.

963
01:08:40,416 --> 01:08:42,541
You see this field trip, eh?

964
01:08:42,625 --> 01:08:44,666
Truthfully,

965
01:08:44,750 --> 01:08:47,250
from my mind of mind,

966
01:08:47,333 --> 01:08:49,041
I don't like it.

967
01:08:49,125 --> 01:08:50,750
I don't want you to go.

968
01:08:52,333 --> 01:08:53,416
-Excuse me?
-Yes!

969
01:08:53,500 --> 01:08:56,458
Join another tutorial group,
do you understand?

970
01:08:56,541 --> 01:08:59,958
You guys are not the only group
going on a field trip.

971
01:09:00,041 --> 01:09:03,375
There are different groups in the class,
you can join another one.

972
01:09:04,583 --> 01:09:08,625
I'm not here to ask your permission.
I came to inform you.

973
01:09:16,375 --> 01:09:18,083
So it's like that?

974
01:09:19,333 --> 01:09:20,500
Hmm?

975
01:09:21,916 --> 01:09:23,625
It's like that now?

976
01:09:25,250 --> 01:09:26,708
Dude!

977
01:09:26,791 --> 01:09:30,166
The last time I looked,
it wasn't your signature

978
01:09:30,250 --> 01:09:32,583
on the check that pays my tuition fees.

979
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:48,250
Koyejo!

980
01:09:49,041 --> 01:09:50,291
Koyejo!

981
01:10:57,125 --> 01:10:58,666
Lucien!

982
01:11:00,500 --> 01:11:03,541
Professor Sembene.
[French] Good to see you.

983
01:11:03,625 --> 01:11:07,583
I'm pleased to see you too,
our traveling professor.

984
01:11:07,666 --> 01:11:09,500
-In fact, in fact.
-It's been quite a while.

985
01:11:09,583 --> 01:11:12,208
Indeed, good to see you.

986
01:11:12,291 --> 01:11:16,958
And this must be the Nigerian tribe
that has adopted you.

987
01:11:17,041 --> 01:11:18,625
In fact, in fact.

988
01:11:18,708 --> 01:11:21,125
Everybody, please come down, come down.

989
01:11:21,208 --> 01:11:23,208
Let me introduce you to Professor.

990
01:11:23,291 --> 01:11:26,416
This time around, I brought ten students.

991
01:11:26,500 --> 01:11:29,291
I must say, they are all exceptional.

992
01:11:29,375 --> 01:11:34,166
The goal is to share some
Senegalese culture with them

993
01:11:34,250 --> 01:11:37,458
-and to tour them around Dakar.
-That's very good.

994
01:11:37,541 --> 01:11:41,000
Everybody is here? Yes, I believe so, yes.

995
01:11:41,083 --> 01:11:45,375
So it is my honor to introduce you
to Professor Sembene.

996
01:11:45,458 --> 01:11:47,875
-Mm-hmm.
-He's the head of, uh...

997
01:11:47,958 --> 01:11:54,375
of department of International Relations
here at Université Cheikh Anta Diop.

998
01:11:54,458 --> 01:11:59,625
But more importantly,
he's my old lecturer.

999
01:11:59,708 --> 01:12:02,333
-Not too old though.
-[laughs]

1000
01:12:02,416 --> 01:12:03,541
You're correct.

1001
01:12:03,625 --> 01:12:07,208
-A very warm welcome to you all.
-Thank you.

1002
01:12:07,291 --> 01:12:11,833
I'll be hosting a reception for you
at the Dean's lodge this evening

1003
01:12:11,916 --> 01:12:17,166
where you can meet some
of your Senegalese colleagues.

1004
01:12:17,250 --> 01:12:21,416
He's saying that we are going to
have a dinner tonight at the Dean's lodge.

1005
01:12:21,500 --> 01:12:23,083
-Thank you, sir.
-Thank you.

1006
01:12:23,166 --> 01:12:25,291
Is anyone fluent in French?

1007
01:12:25,375 --> 01:12:26,958
French?

1008
01:12:27,041 --> 01:12:29,250
She's my brightest star.

1009
01:12:29,333 --> 01:12:32,500
-Yes?
-She speaks French fluently.

1010
01:12:32,583 --> 01:12:33,625
Moremi.

1011
01:12:35,541 --> 01:12:37,458
-It's nice to meet you, Moremi.
-Good day, Professor.

1012
01:12:37,541 --> 01:12:40,458
-How are you?
-I am fine, thank you.

1013
01:12:40,541 --> 01:12:42,041
I am delighted.

1014
01:12:42,125 --> 01:12:46,625
You will be the official interpreter.

1015
01:12:46,708 --> 01:12:49,166
Yes, okay, with all pleasure, sir.

1016
01:12:49,250 --> 01:12:52,291
-That's good.
-Thanks a lot.

1017
01:12:52,375 --> 01:12:56,916
All right, I will be waiting
when you all are done for today.

1018
01:12:57,000 --> 01:13:00,500
You're welcome
and I will be the translator.

1019
01:13:00,583 --> 01:13:02,625
-See you tonight.
-See you all tonight.

1020
01:13:02,708 --> 01:13:05,125
-Thank you, Doctor.
-I'm going for an appointment now.

1021
01:13:05,208 --> 01:13:07,208
-Very well, see you later.
-Yes, see you later.

1022
01:13:07,291 --> 01:13:09,208
See you tonight. Okay.

1023
01:13:09,291 --> 01:13:11,083
Come on, guys, go up.

1024
01:14:06,541 --> 01:14:09,416
It was so fun. It's beautiful.

1025
01:14:09,500 --> 01:14:10,916
Oh, my gosh.

1026
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:13,833
-Thank you, Prof.
-[students cheering]

1027
01:15:26,333 --> 01:15:29,125
-My translator.
-Good evening, sir.

1028
01:15:29,208 --> 01:15:31,375
-How are you?
-I'm fine, thank you.

1029
01:15:31,458 --> 01:15:34,041
-Hope you are having a good time?
-Mm-hmm. Thank you.

1030
01:16:21,208 --> 01:16:23,166
So near, yet so far.

1031
01:16:24,416 --> 01:16:25,791
I'm fine.

1032
01:16:26,875 --> 01:16:30,958
I know that look. Lovers' tiff.

1033
01:16:31,750 --> 01:16:34,791
don't let anyone spoil this
wonderful experience for you.

1034
01:16:35,583 --> 01:16:38,708
Don't believe a word this man says.

1035
01:16:38,791 --> 01:16:41,833
I taught him everything he knows.

1036
01:16:44,916 --> 01:16:46,666
Professor.

1037
01:16:56,791 --> 01:16:58,458
[indistinct chatter]

1038
01:17:19,958 --> 01:17:22,708
-As you can see.
-What's that?

1039
01:17:22,791 --> 01:17:24,583
I kept your old Peugeot for you.

1040
01:17:24,666 --> 01:17:26,541
Really? You should have sold the jalopy.

1041
01:17:26,625 --> 01:17:29,125
No! You used to love driving it.

1042
01:17:29,208 --> 01:17:30,791
[laughs]

1043
01:17:30,875 --> 01:17:33,625
Thanks for hosting us tonight, okay?

1044
01:17:33,708 --> 01:17:37,416
So, we'll see you very soon.
Okay, thanks, Uncle.

1045
01:17:37,500 --> 01:17:38,958
-My translator.
-Thanks, Professor.

1046
01:17:39,041 --> 01:17:41,333
-Thanks a lot, sir.
-Very well.

1047
01:17:41,416 --> 01:17:43,083
Goodbye.

1048
01:17:43,166 --> 01:17:44,750
Goodbye, everyone.

1049
01:17:46,833 --> 01:17:49,000
[Prof. Sembene] In conclusion...

1050
01:17:49,083 --> 01:17:53,000
it is imperative to weigh

1051
01:17:53,083 --> 01:17:59,125
the social ramification of
imposing economic sanctions

1052
01:17:59,208 --> 01:18:01,125
vis-à-vis the political issues
in that country.

1053
01:18:01,208 --> 01:18:04,375
It's crucial to weigh
the social consequences

1054
01:18:04,458 --> 01:18:06,458
of these economic sanctions.

1055
01:18:06,541 --> 01:18:10,416
...otherwise an embargo
will do more harm than good.

1056
01:18:10,500 --> 01:18:15,666
That's it. Professor, finally,
thanks once again.

1057
01:18:15,750 --> 01:18:18,416
-Thank you, too.
-Thanks for the privilege.

1058
01:18:18,500 --> 01:18:22,291
-Dear students, thank you.
-Thank you to my Nigerian students.

1059
01:18:22,375 --> 01:18:24,416
[students cheering]

1060
01:18:24,500 --> 01:18:26,125
Thank you, sir.

1061
01:18:29,916 --> 01:18:33,333
-I think it's cool, you know.
-It is really cool, to be honest.

1062
01:18:33,416 --> 01:18:36,333
And next, after the market,
we have more things and then,

1063
01:18:36,416 --> 01:18:38,666
-you know--
-Hey! Hey! Check this out.

1064
01:18:44,333 --> 01:18:46,208
[inaudible]

1065
01:19:54,333 --> 01:19:57,750
So right here is something
that was donated by Guadeloupe.

1066
01:19:57,833 --> 01:20:00,041
That happened in 1999.

1067
01:20:00,125 --> 01:20:03,000
It's called
the Statue of the Liberation of Slaves.

1068
01:20:05,333 --> 01:20:09,250
What we have here is
very important to the island.

1069
01:20:09,333 --> 01:20:13,041
It came from France back in 1902, 1904...

1070
01:20:30,375 --> 01:20:32,333
[indistinct chatter]

1071
01:20:56,083 --> 01:20:58,083
-Good afternoon.
-Good day.

1072
01:20:58,166 --> 01:21:01,166
-What is your name?
-Samba.

1073
01:21:10,666 --> 01:21:13,125
Where are we going?

1074
01:22:45,166 --> 01:22:47,208
[Moremi] Beautiful.

1075
01:22:57,458 --> 01:22:59,041
It's unbelievable.

1076
01:23:00,416 --> 01:23:01,750
Even more beautiful at night.

1077
01:23:03,083 --> 01:23:04,958
This is probably
the best view of the country.

1078
01:23:07,750 --> 01:23:10,333
I want you to...

1079
01:23:10,416 --> 01:23:13,500
bask in the serenity of the view,

1080
01:23:13,583 --> 01:23:17,166
before the others arrive with
their noise and camera phones. That's it.

1081
01:23:18,125 --> 01:23:21,208
I'll give you a few minutes...
then bring your colleagues, enjoy.

1082
01:23:21,291 --> 01:23:23,333
Don't go. Not yet, Professor.

1083
01:23:28,541 --> 01:23:30,500
This is my village. I grew up here.

1084
01:23:31,541 --> 01:23:34,250
-But you never mentioned it.
-Right.

1085
01:23:35,416 --> 01:23:38,458
As a child,
I grew up without a shirt on my back.

1086
01:23:38,541 --> 01:23:41,458
My father was the local market inspector,

1087
01:23:41,541 --> 01:23:47,333
a drunk who spent his earnings
on drink and women,

1088
01:23:47,416 --> 01:23:52,083
while my mother and I
lived destitute from hand-to-mouth.

1089
01:23:53,541 --> 01:23:58,750
When I was in despair
I would stand here at this very spot,

1090
01:24:00,291 --> 01:24:02,125
then imagine that...

1091
01:24:03,291 --> 01:24:05,791
if I could just spread my wings...

1092
01:24:08,500 --> 01:24:11,125
I could conquer the whole world.

1093
01:24:22,958 --> 01:24:25,416
I will take my leave now.

1094
01:24:26,708 --> 01:24:28,250
Thank you.

1095
01:24:57,041 --> 01:24:58,458
Finally.

1096
01:24:59,375 --> 01:25:00,916
Thank you, Jesus.

1097
01:25:03,416 --> 01:25:05,625
We're sorry to keep you waiting.

1098
01:25:05,708 --> 01:25:07,833
-We shall go now.
-All right.

1099
01:25:14,625 --> 01:25:17,000
Where did you get to?

1100
01:25:17,083 --> 01:25:18,375
I wandered.

1101
01:25:18,458 --> 01:25:20,916
Got lost, he found me.

1102
01:25:47,666 --> 01:25:50,958
[Lucien] It became very apparent
that Miss Oluwa would do anything

1103
01:25:51,708 --> 01:25:53,000
to be with me.

1104
01:25:53,791 --> 01:25:55,375
Alone.

1105
01:25:55,458 --> 01:25:58,750
But quite often a student
can grow attached to a tutor,

1106
01:25:58,833 --> 01:26:01,083
even of the same gender,

1107
01:26:02,416 --> 01:26:05,625
based purely on academic admiration,

1108
01:26:05,708 --> 01:26:08,541
without implying any sexual liaison,
not so?

1109
01:26:08,625 --> 01:26:13,458
Mm-hmm. Yeah, correct, madam.
That's precisely what I assumed.

1110
01:26:14,708 --> 01:26:17,125
In your report about that incident,

1111
01:26:17,208 --> 01:26:20,333
you mentioned something
about an awkward incident

1112
01:26:20,416 --> 01:26:23,458
that happened at a bonfire
somewhere in, um...

1113
01:26:23,541 --> 01:26:26,166
-Cape Verde.
-Yes, Cape Verde.

1114
01:26:26,250 --> 01:26:30,291
But that was not
part of your trip itinerary.

1115
01:26:30,375 --> 01:26:32,166
No.

1116
01:26:32,250 --> 01:26:34,791
Well, in Dakar...

1117
01:26:35,708 --> 01:26:37,458
my class has been...

1118
01:26:38,291 --> 01:26:43,791
swamped throughout the week
with symposiums,

1119
01:26:43,875 --> 01:26:49,291
seminars, joint classes
with Senegalese counterparts.

1120
01:26:49,375 --> 01:26:54,500
So on the last day
I decided to fly everybody to Cape Verde,

1121
01:26:54,583 --> 01:26:59,541
which is just an hour away from Dakar,
at my expense.

1122
01:26:59,625 --> 01:27:04,458
Just so they could relax
and unwind from a most taxing week.

1123
01:27:11,041 --> 01:27:13,125
[all singing]

1124
01:27:58,666 --> 01:28:01,250
[Moremi] I know you're tired of her.

1125
01:28:01,333 --> 01:28:05,291
Listen, I know Gloria can be
a pain in the butt sometimes.

1126
01:28:05,375 --> 01:28:07,291
But I know you miss her.

1127
01:28:08,625 --> 01:28:12,333
Look, a pain I can deal with,
but indifferent

1128
01:28:12,416 --> 01:28:15,125
leaves me feeling like
a mirage in the Sahara desert.

1129
01:28:15,208 --> 01:28:17,750
Now you're just waxing philosophical.

1130
01:28:17,833 --> 01:28:20,666
Gloria does not feel indifferent to you.

1131
01:28:20,750 --> 01:28:22,458
Well, of late, she has been.

1132
01:28:23,333 --> 01:28:24,750
I feel she's...

1133
01:28:24,833 --> 01:28:27,250
seeing someone back on campus in Nigeria.

1134
01:28:29,625 --> 01:28:31,708
No way!

1135
01:28:31,791 --> 01:28:34,208
Gloria doesn't date small boys.

1136
01:28:34,291 --> 01:28:35,875
Maybe he's not a student then.

1137
01:28:37,208 --> 01:28:41,083
[sighs] Look, I've spotted her
coming back from staff quarters

1138
01:28:41,166 --> 01:28:43,375
on my early morning jogs.

1139
01:28:47,666 --> 01:28:49,625
[phone ringing]

1140
01:28:55,708 --> 01:28:58,875
-Mr. Kwesi, can you please hold this?
-All right.

1141
01:29:01,375 --> 01:29:03,375
You better come back quick
or else I'll finish this.

1142
01:29:16,333 --> 01:29:20,875
What will you expect me to do?
So I'm just supposed to leave Senegal,

1143
01:29:20,958 --> 01:29:22,750
go back to Lagos and do what?

1144
01:29:22,833 --> 01:29:26,625
Do what? I told you that. Do you trust me?

1145
01:29:26,708 --> 01:29:30,250
The professor is not even doing anything.
I don't understand the problem.

1146
01:29:30,333 --> 01:29:33,208
Okay, so I come back and then what?

1147
01:29:33,291 --> 01:29:35,708
You're going to think that something
happened with Professor Lucien?

1148
01:29:35,791 --> 01:29:37,541
Cool. You know what?

1149
01:29:39,250 --> 01:29:40,791
Can we end it?

1150
01:29:50,708 --> 01:29:52,000
[French] Hello.

1151
01:29:53,458 --> 01:29:54,916
Good day, Professor.

1152
01:29:56,458 --> 01:29:58,500
You're alone.

1153
01:29:59,666 --> 01:30:01,958
-I just needed some space.
-Ah.

1154
01:30:03,833 --> 01:30:06,250
Well, plenty of space here.

1155
01:30:08,375 --> 01:30:10,416
Historical sources claim that...

1156
01:30:11,833 --> 01:30:14,416
out from these very shores,
400 years ago...

1157
01:30:15,250 --> 01:30:18,166
over a million
African slaves were shipped.

1158
01:30:20,125 --> 01:30:22,583
It makes me wonder...

1159
01:30:22,666 --> 01:30:27,541
how many secrets
are buried out in that sea.

1160
01:30:29,666 --> 01:30:31,125
The doctor?

1161
01:30:32,083 --> 01:30:34,333
-He broke up with me.
-Oh.

1162
01:30:36,291 --> 01:30:37,875
Sorry to hear.

1163
01:30:38,666 --> 01:30:41,208
If he was dumb enough to let you go,

1164
01:30:41,291 --> 01:30:46,541
then he was never smart enough
to have you in the first place.

1165
01:30:52,625 --> 01:30:55,541
I'm sorry. Moremi!

1166
01:31:04,541 --> 01:31:05,916
[Lucien] She was upset.

1167
01:31:10,166 --> 01:31:13,291
With issues from her personal life,
with her boyfriend, I think.

1168
01:31:14,166 --> 01:31:15,541
I comforted her.

1169
01:31:17,166 --> 01:31:18,666
And then she tried to kiss me.

1170
01:31:20,625 --> 01:31:22,833
She tried to kiss you?

1171
01:31:24,250 --> 01:31:27,583
Yes, she did,
but I stopped her, of course.

1172
01:31:30,416 --> 01:31:32,083
Professor N'Dyare...

1173
01:31:34,125 --> 01:31:37,125
when you returned to Nigeria,

1174
01:31:37,208 --> 01:31:42,041
did you report the incident to the Dean?

1175
01:31:42,125 --> 01:31:45,041
-No, I did not.
-Really?

1176
01:31:46,083 --> 01:31:49,208
Okay, fine. Did you report to anybody?

1177
01:31:58,875 --> 01:32:02,166
Professor N'Dyare,
you will answer for the record.

1178
01:32:14,875 --> 01:32:18,416
I did not report the incident.

1179
01:32:19,833 --> 01:32:24,708
I excused Miss Oluwa's behavior
as an emotional outburst...

1180
01:32:26,666 --> 01:32:30,666
to problems she was having
in her personal life.

1181
01:32:33,250 --> 01:32:38,208
Did you and Miss Oluwa
ever refer back to that incident?

1182
01:32:38,291 --> 01:32:40,416
It came in conversation.

1183
01:32:43,125 --> 01:32:46,500
[Gloria] Gosh, I really missed.
Like, I missed.

1184
01:32:46,583 --> 01:32:48,000
It was really no biggie.

1185
01:32:48,083 --> 01:32:49,625
Yeah, right.

1186
01:32:49,708 --> 01:32:53,708
We went to that boring ECOWAS office
in Abuja, my team and I,

1187
01:32:53,791 --> 01:32:57,541
and you guys got to go to Cape Verde
and Senegal.

1188
01:32:57,625 --> 01:33:00,208
And you tell me I didn't miss much?
Yeah, right.

1189
01:33:00,291 --> 01:33:02,666
To be honest, I wish I hadn't even gone.

1190
01:33:02,750 --> 01:33:06,000
Girlfriend, I heard all the juicy details.

1191
01:33:06,083 --> 01:33:09,958
I mean, heard everything about you
and the professor.

1192
01:33:10,041 --> 01:33:11,333
Please!

1193
01:33:11,416 --> 01:33:15,375
I heard you guys were bonded together,
you know, like Nigeria and Cameroon.

1194
01:33:15,458 --> 01:33:18,458
No wonder you were warding me off the guy.
You already had eyes for him.

1195
01:33:18,541 --> 01:33:20,625
[Pidgin] You are dating a genius,
to be sincere.

1196
01:33:20,708 --> 01:33:23,375
-Gloria, something happened--
- [Lucien] Moremi.

1197
01:33:23,458 --> 01:33:25,625
Oh, shit! I was hoping to avoid him.

1198
01:33:25,708 --> 01:33:29,125
-Okay, so I better be going.
-No, no, stay with me, stay with me.

1199
01:33:31,250 --> 01:33:32,791
I haven't seen you in class.

1200
01:33:32,875 --> 01:33:38,125
I've been busy working on my
dissertation, chapters four and five.

1201
01:33:40,625 --> 01:33:44,000
[French] About what
happened in Cape Verde.

1202
01:33:44,958 --> 01:33:47,541
I'd rather not talk about that, sir.

1203
01:33:50,625 --> 01:33:52,416
I acted inappropriately.

1204
01:33:52,500 --> 01:33:55,541
I don't know what came over me.

1205
01:33:55,625 --> 01:34:01,500
It was a moment of weakness
that I now find utterly embarrassing.

1206
01:34:03,875 --> 01:34:05,833
My profound apology.

1207
01:34:09,041 --> 01:34:10,541
So you will return to class?

1208
01:34:11,958 --> 01:34:13,708
Yes.

1209
01:34:13,791 --> 01:34:15,291
Have a good day.

1210
01:34:23,125 --> 01:34:25,291
What... Wait...

1211
01:34:25,375 --> 01:34:27,500
What just happened?

1212
01:34:27,583 --> 01:34:29,500
Nothing, come on.

1213
01:34:29,583 --> 01:34:31,708
-Nothing?
-Nothing.

1214
01:34:31,791 --> 01:34:34,291
[Gloria] Remi!

1215
01:34:34,375 --> 01:34:37,750
I guess after she apologized
for her transgression,

1216
01:34:37,833 --> 01:34:41,666
there was no need for me
to take the case any further.

1217
01:34:43,375 --> 01:34:47,083
Miss Oluwa apologized to you
over that incident?

1218
01:34:47,166 --> 01:34:52,708
Yes, she did, in front
of her colleague Gloria Dokai.

1219
01:34:52,791 --> 01:34:54,833
You can check, please.

1220
01:34:59,250 --> 01:35:01,750
Well, ladies and gentlemen,

1221
01:35:01,833 --> 01:35:05,083
it's been a full day,

1222
01:35:05,166 --> 01:35:08,666
so I think we should shut down for the day

1223
01:35:08,750 --> 01:35:13,958
and, uh, tomorrow morning at 9:00 a.m.
we would start again,

1224
01:35:14,041 --> 01:35:17,083
where we will take
our witness testimonies.

1225
01:35:17,166 --> 01:35:21,541
And at 12:00 we will reconvene
to continue the session.

1226
01:35:21,625 --> 01:35:23,583
Please do not forget my admonition.

1227
01:35:23,666 --> 01:35:28,833
No personal contact or communication
with any of the witnesses.

1228
01:35:28,916 --> 01:35:31,958
It will not be tolerated in any form.

1229
01:35:32,041 --> 01:35:35,250
Thank you very much,
gentlemen and ladies, for your work.

1230
01:35:35,333 --> 01:35:37,125
Have a good evening.

1231
01:35:38,333 --> 01:35:40,375
[indistinct chatter]

1232
01:35:40,458 --> 01:35:41,958
I'll see you guys tomorrow.

1233
01:35:42,041 --> 01:35:44,416
Correct guy. Hold this sister well.

1234
01:35:46,500 --> 01:35:48,000
Koyejo!

1235
01:35:57,416 --> 01:35:59,125
Come on.

1236
01:36:01,416 --> 01:36:03,583
[Yoruba] we're not
supposed to be speaking.

1237
01:36:05,833 --> 01:36:07,041
Even you?

1238
01:36:07,958 --> 01:36:10,833
Ah-ah! It's shocking.

1239
01:36:12,333 --> 01:36:15,791
-That's how highly you think of me?
-No, that's not the point.

1240
01:36:17,375 --> 01:36:19,000
That's not it.

1241
01:36:19,916 --> 01:36:26,166
I warned you not to get overfamiliar
with that man. You ignored me.

1242
01:36:27,791 --> 01:36:30,416
I told you not to go to Dakar.
You stubbornly went.

1243
01:36:30,500 --> 01:36:34,375
Yeah, so...
All I know is that you were my babe.

1244
01:36:34,458 --> 01:36:37,625
But now... not anymore.

1245
01:36:41,125 --> 01:36:42,916
All I know is...

1246
01:36:44,958 --> 01:36:47,666
I wanted you to believe in me...

1247
01:36:48,708 --> 01:36:49,958
but you don't.

1248
01:36:50,875 --> 01:36:52,416
Oh, shit!

1249
01:37:02,166 --> 01:37:06,250
Didn't I just see you
communicating with a witness,

1250
01:37:06,333 --> 01:37:09,333
due to give testimony at the hearing?

1251
01:37:09,416 --> 01:37:12,541
I ran into him by mistake.

1252
01:37:14,333 --> 01:37:15,750
Oh, really?

1253
01:37:19,500 --> 01:37:25,666
You're PG? So tell me,
what are you doing in med school?

1254
01:37:25,750 --> 01:37:27,875
I had a migraine.

1255
01:37:27,958 --> 01:37:30,625
I thought I could pick up a prescription.

1256
01:37:31,708 --> 01:37:33,041
Can I see it?

1257
01:37:37,250 --> 01:37:40,416
-The prescription, Miss Oluwa.
-Babes...

1258
01:37:41,708 --> 01:37:43,916
Give me a break.

1259
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:46,166
I'm just fighting for my life.

1260
01:37:48,916 --> 01:37:50,916
Get some rest.

1261
01:37:51,958 --> 01:37:55,791
I think that's a better prescription
for migraine. Have a nice day.

1262
01:38:08,791 --> 01:38:10,500
[Kwesi] Well, they were close,

1263
01:38:10,583 --> 01:38:13,125
but I didn't notice
anything out of the ordinary.

1264
01:38:14,375 --> 01:38:17,250
I mean, despite
their different capacities...

1265
01:38:17,333 --> 01:38:19,708
intellectually they were on par.

1266
01:38:19,791 --> 01:38:22,375
Well, Moremi always had this saying.

1267
01:38:22,458 --> 01:38:25,666
I mean, she's fond of saying
that age to her was just

1268
01:38:25,750 --> 01:38:28,375
a function of mind over matter.

1269
01:38:28,458 --> 01:38:31,750
I mean, if she didn't mind,
it didn't matter.

1270
01:38:31,833 --> 01:38:34,875
And she was clearly obsessed
with this man that is

1271
01:38:34,958 --> 01:38:36,791
older than her by 20 years.

1272
01:38:36,875 --> 01:38:39,875
I definitely saw Remi
take an interest in the professor

1273
01:38:39,958 --> 01:38:41,791
that was very, very unusual.

1274
01:38:41,875 --> 01:38:46,666
It was obvious she admires him.
Everyone in class knew.

1275
01:38:46,750 --> 01:38:49,333
But, as for me,
I believe Jesus will intervene.

1276
01:38:49,416 --> 01:38:54,833
Prof. N'Dyare actually
gave preferential attention to Moremi.

1277
01:38:56,750 --> 01:39:00,666
It was an open secret in the class
that she was his pet student.

1278
01:39:00,750 --> 01:39:03,791
Well, I wouldn't say that she was his pet.

1279
01:39:04,833 --> 01:39:08,000
Look, she's the youngest in the class,

1280
01:39:08,083 --> 01:39:12,125
but academically
she's by far the smartest.

1281
01:39:12,208 --> 01:39:14,458
I mean, that is bound to
catch any lecturer's attention.

1282
01:39:14,541 --> 01:39:19,416
At Goree Island they kept us waiting
for ages while they went AWOL.

1283
01:39:19,500 --> 01:39:22,416
When they did show up, it was odd.

1284
01:39:22,500 --> 01:39:24,666
But I believe Jesus will intervene.

1285
01:39:24,750 --> 01:39:28,291
Well, I was there, I was there
when she approached the professor,

1286
01:39:28,375 --> 01:39:32,000
trying to apologize for her trying
to kiss him during their field trip.

1287
01:39:32,666 --> 01:39:36,416
The professor has always
been such a consummate professional,

1288
01:39:36,500 --> 01:39:39,625
but she... she has always
been on the man, like...

1289
01:39:39,708 --> 01:39:40,916
tirelessly.

1290
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:46,875
No, no, no. It was actually the prof
that was chasing after Moremi,

1291
01:39:46,958 --> 01:39:49,083
especially during the field trip.

1292
01:39:51,291 --> 01:39:53,291
Wherever Moremi went to,

1293
01:39:53,375 --> 01:39:56,791
you'll see the professor running
after her like, um...

1294
01:39:56,875 --> 01:39:58,958
a lovesick puppy.

1295
01:39:59,041 --> 01:40:00,416
It was blatant.

1296
01:40:00,500 --> 01:40:03,791
Moremi never complained to me
that he was harassing her.

1297
01:40:04,833 --> 01:40:06,875
But after the Easter party,

1298
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:10,875
I sensed she was
deeply troubled about something.

1299
01:40:12,791 --> 01:40:14,958
She appeared quiet,

1300
01:40:16,125 --> 01:40:17,625
withdrawn.

1301
01:40:19,708 --> 01:40:22,083
Moremi did confess to me that, um...

1302
01:40:22,166 --> 01:40:24,583
you know, she was going to...

1303
01:40:24,666 --> 01:40:27,416
bed the professor
before the end of the semester.

1304
01:40:27,500 --> 01:40:30,833
That was her only way of guaranteeing
that she had an interview for the UN.

1305
01:40:31,750 --> 01:40:35,041
She was infatuated by this man, clearly.

1306
01:40:39,333 --> 01:40:40,833
[Prof. Osagie] Miss Oluwa,

1307
01:40:42,166 --> 01:40:46,458
regarding the first five chapters
of your dissertation...

1308
01:40:48,208 --> 01:40:54,291
what gave you the impression
that Professor N'Dyare

1309
01:40:54,375 --> 01:40:57,208
had approved it in the first place?

1310
01:41:01,291 --> 01:41:03,500
He told me so.

1311
01:41:05,333 --> 01:41:06,750
When?

1312
01:41:07,833 --> 01:41:09,666
Where?

1313
01:41:09,750 --> 01:41:11,750
In tutorial class?

1314
01:41:18,750 --> 01:41:20,166
In his house.

1315
01:41:29,583 --> 01:41:31,000
And...

1316
01:41:31,083 --> 01:41:36,916
what on earth were you doing in your
course supervisor's house, Miss Oluwa?

1317
01:41:39,666 --> 01:41:43,291
He invited the whole class over
on Easter Sunday,

1318
01:41:43,375 --> 01:41:46,625
a public holiday, for a social gathering.

1319
01:42:01,583 --> 01:42:03,041
Here comes the pizza.

1320
01:42:04,583 --> 01:42:08,083
Please go ahead.
It's for you. Don't be shy.

1321
01:42:11,041 --> 01:42:13,291
But I wish she was here today,
that would have been nice.

1322
01:42:13,375 --> 01:42:15,750
Gloria, I mean, she is a pain in the ass.

1323
01:42:15,833 --> 01:42:17,666
A little bit, sometimes.

1324
01:42:19,958 --> 01:42:21,583
[Moremi] It was a fun, relaxed gathering,

1325
01:42:21,666 --> 01:42:24,625
but something I ate
didn't sit right with me,

1326
01:42:24,708 --> 01:42:28,791
and I was in the bathroom
for over 30 minutes, purging.

1327
01:42:33,625 --> 01:42:35,958
-See you soon, okay?
-All right, Prof.

1328
01:42:36,041 --> 01:42:38,333
-See you in class, thank you so much.
-My pleasure, thanks for coming.

1329
01:42:38,416 --> 01:42:39,916
-Thank you very much, yeah.

1330
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:41,333
-Thank you so much, Prof. God bless you.
-No, it was a pleasure.

1331
01:42:41,416 --> 01:42:42,833
See you in class. Yes.

1332
01:42:42,916 --> 01:42:43,916
-Thank you, sir.
-Okay.

1333
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:45,333
-Prof.
-Thanks for hosting us.

1334
01:42:45,416 --> 01:42:48,291
Take care. Yes, indeed.
Okay. It was a pleasure.

1335
01:42:48,375 --> 01:42:49,833
Prof.

1336
01:42:49,916 --> 01:42:52,500
-Thank you. See you soon.
-Thanks for coming. Okay.

1337
01:42:52,583 --> 01:42:54,583
-All right.
-Bye-bye. See you in class.

1338
01:42:54,666 --> 01:42:56,083
Okay, sir.

1339
01:42:57,500 --> 01:42:58,958
[yawns]

1340
01:43:06,708 --> 01:43:07,958
Moremi?

1341
01:43:09,291 --> 01:43:11,666
[French] Where is everyone?

1342
01:43:13,666 --> 01:43:16,166
They left. I thought you had gone, too.

1343
01:43:17,125 --> 01:43:19,458
Something I ate.

1344
01:43:19,541 --> 01:43:23,333
Maybe it was my Senegalese jollof rice.

1345
01:43:24,625 --> 01:43:26,750
-Are you all right now?
-Better.

1346
01:43:27,875 --> 01:43:31,541
Thanks for a lovely evening. I should go.

1347
01:43:31,625 --> 01:43:33,041
No problem.

1348
01:43:34,791 --> 01:43:39,041
Please, can you at least help me clear up

1349
01:43:39,125 --> 01:43:41,666
before you run off?

1350
01:43:41,750 --> 01:43:44,791
-Okay.
-Yeah? Thank you.

1351
01:43:48,041 --> 01:43:52,000
I wasn't going to reveal it here and now,

1352
01:43:52,083 --> 01:43:56,375
but I have approved the first five
chapters of your thesis.

1353
01:43:56,458 --> 01:43:59,791
You came up with some fascinating theories

1354
01:43:59,875 --> 01:44:03,583
on conflict resolution in the Middle East.

1355
01:44:03,666 --> 01:44:07,041
-Exceptional.
-I don't know what to say.

1356
01:44:09,000 --> 01:44:11,208
I'm pretty certain
you're going to say thank you,

1357
01:44:11,291 --> 01:44:16,125
when I tell you that I've also referred
you to a high-ranking colleague at the UN.

1358
01:44:16,208 --> 01:44:20,333
There will be an interview
awaiting you in New York

1359
01:44:20,416 --> 01:44:22,833
once you complete
your postgraduate studies.

1360
01:44:22,916 --> 01:44:25,291
Thank you so much!

1361
01:44:30,250 --> 01:44:33,041
It's okay. Keep up the good work.

1362
01:44:33,125 --> 01:44:34,791
I'm so sorry.

1363
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:39,083
It's okay. No problem.

1364
01:44:45,666 --> 01:44:49,083
You look ravishing this evening.

1365
01:44:50,416 --> 01:44:51,791
Thank you.

1366
01:44:53,208 --> 01:44:54,250
Do you mind?

1367
01:44:54,333 --> 01:44:56,583
Let me have your hand.

1368
01:44:56,666 --> 01:44:57,875
Come on, come closer.

1369
01:45:00,416 --> 01:45:02,041
What do you think you're doing?

1370
01:45:05,083 --> 01:45:06,666
You know that I...

1371
01:45:07,958 --> 01:45:09,916
-Stop pretending.
-No!

1372
01:45:11,250 --> 01:45:13,250
Why are you pretending?

1373
01:45:14,250 --> 01:45:16,291
Please let me go!

1374
01:45:16,375 --> 01:45:20,041
But you have been
staring at me all evening.

1375
01:45:20,125 --> 01:45:22,166
-No!
-Teasing me with your eyes.

1376
01:45:22,250 --> 01:45:24,666
-No!
-See how you are dressed.

1377
01:45:24,750 --> 01:45:27,958
You wore this to seduce me.
You intentionally stayed back.

1378
01:45:28,041 --> 01:45:29,333
No, I didn't.

1379
01:45:30,583 --> 01:45:33,333
Stop the pretense! Be still!

1380
01:45:33,416 --> 01:45:34,666
Stop it!

1381
01:45:34,750 --> 01:45:36,750
You wore this dress to seduce me.

1382
01:45:36,833 --> 01:45:38,708
Please don't hurt me!

1383
01:45:38,791 --> 01:45:41,291
Can't you see that I care about you
too much to harm you?

1384
01:45:41,375 --> 01:45:43,416
-I promise to be gentle.
-No!

1385
01:45:43,500 --> 01:45:45,166
Then why were you staring at me?

1386
01:45:46,125 --> 01:45:49,041
Stop it! Stop it! Stop this!

1387
01:45:49,125 --> 01:45:50,958
Be still!

1388
01:45:51,041 --> 01:45:53,708
You wore this dress to seduce me.

1389
01:45:55,416 --> 01:45:56,708
No!

1390
01:46:00,083 --> 01:46:02,250
Why are you pretending?

1391
01:46:02,333 --> 01:46:04,083
Keep quiet!

1392
01:46:05,500 --> 01:46:06,708
Okay.

1393
01:46:08,416 --> 01:46:11,541
-Okay.
-Be calm.

1394
01:46:11,625 --> 01:46:14,625
-Okay.
-Are we good? Yeah?

1395
01:46:14,708 --> 01:46:18,750
All right, I will be gentle and slow.

1396
01:46:26,041 --> 01:46:32,833
Miss Oluwa, are you implying
that your course supervisor,

1397
01:46:32,916 --> 01:46:34,958
a senior lecturer of this university,

1398
01:46:35,875 --> 01:46:38,375
a professor of international repute,

1399
01:46:39,291 --> 01:46:42,083
attempted to assault you?

1400
01:46:44,583 --> 01:46:48,708
No, sir.
I'm saying he attempted to rape me.

1401
01:46:49,625 --> 01:46:51,875
Oh! Rape?

1402
01:46:54,041 --> 01:46:56,458
Did you make an official complaint?

1403
01:47:00,333 --> 01:47:04,333
-Not at the time, no.
-And, um... why not?

1404
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:07,000
Because I treated his fuck-up!

1405
01:47:14,041 --> 01:47:17,000
Miss Oluwa, I know tempers are rising,

1406
01:47:17,083 --> 01:47:19,625
but you cannot speak
with that kind of language.

1407
01:47:19,708 --> 01:47:21,166
He's still your professor.

1408
01:47:26,250 --> 01:47:27,750
My dear.

1409
01:47:29,041 --> 01:47:30,291
[Lucien screams]

1410
01:47:39,208 --> 01:47:40,666
It's not over yet!

1411
01:47:42,458 --> 01:47:43,500
Professor N'Dyare?

1412
01:47:50,083 --> 01:47:53,833
Well, part of her story is accurate.

1413
01:47:55,083 --> 01:47:57,000
But the rest...

1414
01:47:57,083 --> 01:48:01,833
is a complete figment
of Miss Oluwa's fertile imagination.

1415
01:48:03,666 --> 01:48:07,958
Yes, she did stay back
after her colleagues had left.

1416
01:48:09,625 --> 01:48:11,250
But it was she...

1417
01:48:12,416 --> 01:48:14,125
who offered sex to me.

1418
01:48:15,750 --> 01:48:17,583
It was I...

1419
01:48:18,500 --> 01:48:20,250
who rejected it.

1420
01:48:22,208 --> 01:48:26,333
There was never any offer
of interview at the UN.

1421
01:48:27,125 --> 01:48:31,250
Or any mention whatsoever
of her dissertation.

1422
01:48:32,458 --> 01:48:34,291
Obviously there is...

1423
01:48:35,458 --> 01:48:37,375
never...

1424
01:48:37,458 --> 01:48:38,708
ever...

1425
01:48:38,791 --> 01:48:41,458
any attempted rape.

1426
01:48:42,666 --> 01:48:46,125
Did you inform anyone she offered you sex?

1427
01:48:46,208 --> 01:48:48,291
Of course I did.

1428
01:48:48,375 --> 01:48:49,875
The following morning.

1429
01:48:50,833 --> 01:48:57,375
To the dean of the postgraduate school
present here, Professor Osagie.

1430
01:49:00,125 --> 01:49:02,875
I can confirm that...

1431
01:49:02,958 --> 01:49:08,458
Professor N'Dyare mentioned
the incident to me.

1432
01:49:32,333 --> 01:49:34,791
Now imagine this belonged
to your sister...

1433
01:49:37,541 --> 01:49:39,500
or daughter!

1434
01:49:49,166 --> 01:49:52,708
Now, that wasn't a very
smart stunt you pulled in there.

1435
01:49:53,583 --> 01:49:57,750
The panel were never going
to accept that exhibit into evidence.

1436
01:49:57,833 --> 01:49:59,791
I had to do something.

1437
01:49:59,875 --> 01:50:02,791
He sat there all week
and told lie after lie

1438
01:50:02,875 --> 01:50:05,375
to suit his bullshit narrative.

1439
01:50:07,208 --> 01:50:08,916
All right, no problem.

1440
01:50:11,125 --> 01:50:13,458
-You were very brave in there.
-Brave?

1441
01:50:13,541 --> 01:50:16,958
-Very good.
-More like a brave fool.

1442
01:50:17,041 --> 01:50:20,208
He's clever. Manipulative, credible.

1443
01:50:20,291 --> 01:50:22,750
They believe him, not me.

1444
01:50:22,833 --> 01:50:26,625
My own faculty dean, Professor Osagie,
is giving me dirty looks.

1445
01:50:27,541 --> 01:50:30,416
Look, calm down.

1446
01:50:30,500 --> 01:50:35,416
The Ajike Advocacy is in this with you
all the way.

1447
01:50:39,166 --> 01:50:41,291
With all due respect, ma'am

1448
01:50:41,375 --> 01:50:47,291
Ajike is just an organization using
my situation to make a name for itself.

1449
01:50:47,375 --> 01:50:49,958
Remi, that is uncalled for.

1450
01:50:51,041 --> 01:50:53,541
I won't be a case study.

1451
01:50:53,625 --> 01:50:57,916
This is my education, my reputation.
My future is on the line right now!

1452
01:50:58,000 --> 01:51:00,666
We're doing our very best here.

1453
01:51:00,750 --> 01:51:03,541
But it's not making any difference.

1454
01:51:03,625 --> 01:51:07,416
No wonder some students
take matters into their own hands.

1455
01:51:07,500 --> 01:51:11,125
Justice isn't blind here.
It has 20/20 vision,

1456
01:51:11,208 --> 01:51:13,041
all in favor of the faculty.

1457
01:51:16,333 --> 01:51:18,166
I need to get into his head.

1458
01:51:19,000 --> 01:51:20,708
Into his past.

1459
01:51:21,833 --> 01:51:24,208
-That was a good tutorial.
-Yeah, it was.

1460
01:51:24,291 --> 01:51:25,666
-You know?
-I know.

1461
01:51:25,750 --> 01:51:27,291
Hey, that was some good lecture.

1462
01:51:27,375 --> 01:51:30,083
Yeah, I feel like we're picking up
a lot of stuff.

1463
01:51:30,166 --> 01:51:31,625
True, exactly.

1464
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:37,333
Oh, man! I can do
some swimming this afternoon.

1465
01:51:37,416 --> 01:51:39,500
I think I'll join you. It's too hot.

1466
01:51:39,583 --> 01:51:41,166
-It's way too hot.
-It is.

1467
01:51:41,250 --> 01:51:42,583
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1468
01:51:54,625 --> 01:51:56,541
[French]
Don't walk too near the edge of the cliff,

1469
01:51:56,625 --> 01:51:58,291
in case the wind
blows the wrong way and...

1470
01:51:58,375 --> 01:51:59,416
stumbles you over.

1471
01:52:07,375 --> 01:52:08,666
What was that?

1472
01:52:19,791 --> 01:52:21,750
What are you doing?

1473
01:52:44,333 --> 01:52:48,541
[French] Please excuse me.
I'm looking for a lecturer who works here.

1474
01:52:48,625 --> 01:52:51,208
His name is Cardosa.

1475
01:52:51,291 --> 01:52:55,333
Cardosa?
Sorry, no lecturer bearing that name here.

1476
01:52:55,416 --> 01:53:00,666
Oh! I'm sure that was his name.
He had it written on his lab coat.

1477
01:53:00,750 --> 01:53:03,916
He must be a laboratory assistant.

1478
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:06,708
He can't be a lecturer,
because they don't wear name labels.

1479
01:53:07,416 --> 01:53:10,250
-Okay.
-But they don't work weekends.

1480
01:53:11,375 --> 01:53:13,791
[sighs] Thank you.

1481
01:53:15,791 --> 01:53:17,500
[bell ringing]

1482
01:53:46,166 --> 01:53:50,208
As you can see,
I kept your old Peugeot for you.

1483
01:53:50,291 --> 01:53:52,583
Really? You should have sold the jalopy.

1484
01:53:52,666 --> 01:53:55,041
No, you used to love driving it.

1485
01:53:55,125 --> 01:53:56,750
[laughs]

1486
01:53:56,833 --> 01:53:59,125
Thanks for keeping my car.

1487
01:54:21,333 --> 01:54:25,708
I don't want you to make fun of me.
I don't know how to drive stick.

1488
01:54:25,791 --> 01:54:27,708
Excuse me?

1489
01:54:43,416 --> 01:54:45,416
What are you doing here, Moremi?

1490
01:54:45,500 --> 01:54:47,125
I am looking for someone.

1491
01:54:48,875 --> 01:54:50,833
Moremi, you know...

1492
01:54:53,291 --> 01:54:58,083
I have followed reports
of your hearing online.

1493
01:54:59,750 --> 01:55:05,000
for the record,
I believe Lucien is innocent...

1494
01:55:05,083 --> 01:55:09,083
of the allegation you made against him.

1495
01:55:10,833 --> 01:55:16,375
So you think I'm deliberately
trying to ruin his career?

1496
01:55:18,291 --> 01:55:20,416
I think you may...

1497
01:55:22,083 --> 01:55:25,541
be a student who
cannot accept the fact that...

1498
01:55:25,625 --> 01:55:27,125
your best just wasn't good enough.

1499
01:55:30,291 --> 01:55:32,083
I am trying to locate Mr. Cardosa.

1500
01:55:33,500 --> 01:55:35,125
Cardosa?

1501
01:55:36,375 --> 01:55:37,916
I've never heard of him.

1502
01:55:38,833 --> 01:55:42,833
He's a laboratory assistant
in the science faculty.

1503
01:55:43,416 --> 01:55:45,916
That's not my area of expertise.

1504
01:55:46,500 --> 01:55:50,958
But you have access to
university records and contact details.

1505
01:55:51,041 --> 01:55:56,000
Miss, what's this Cardosa got to do
with your problem in Nigeria?

1506
01:55:57,083 --> 01:55:58,666
That's what I need to find out.

1507
01:56:00,875 --> 01:56:06,083
I am not going to conspire with you
to bring down the career of a good tutor.

1508
01:56:08,041 --> 01:56:09,208
You know...

1509
01:56:10,416 --> 01:56:13,500
Lucien is a former student of mine.

1510
01:56:13,583 --> 01:56:17,041
I've worked alongside him. I know the man.

1511
01:56:18,375 --> 01:56:24,791
Lucien would never request sex
in exchange for marks from a student.

1512
01:56:24,875 --> 01:56:26,208
Never!

1513
01:56:27,083 --> 01:56:28,208
Thanks for your time.

1514
01:56:31,000 --> 01:56:35,916
I'll be staying overnight
at the university guest house.

1515
01:56:41,708 --> 01:56:45,375
Did Professor N'Dyare ever tell you

1516
01:56:46,333 --> 01:56:49,041
how my close friendship with him started?

1517
01:56:51,958 --> 01:56:54,291
I taught him how to drive a car...

1518
01:56:54,375 --> 01:56:56,833
with a manual gear shift.

1519
02:01:16,500 --> 02:01:18,083
Samba?

1520
02:01:21,791 --> 02:01:24,041
[crowd chanting]

1521
02:01:57,166 --> 02:01:59,916
[French] I am looking for Mr. Cardosa.

1522
02:02:04,958 --> 02:02:07,041
[crowd cheering]

1523
02:02:32,666 --> 02:02:34,500
[French] Mr. Cardosa?

1524
02:02:39,125 --> 02:02:41,541
[crowd cheering]

1525
02:02:57,750 --> 02:03:01,666
[French] Finally you are here. Please sit.

1526
02:03:10,541 --> 02:03:12,041
[Moremi] He was right.

1527
02:03:13,958 --> 02:03:15,291
It's more beautiful here.

1528
02:03:20,791 --> 02:03:22,458
Not as beautiful as my country.

1529
02:03:24,916 --> 02:03:27,041
You're not Senegalese?

1530
02:03:30,958 --> 02:03:34,666
Lack of work made me
relocate to Senegal many years ago.

1531
02:03:36,791 --> 02:03:40,791
However, it was always my dream
for my daughter

1532
02:03:40,875 --> 02:03:43,375
to attend university
in the country of my birth.

1533
02:03:43,458 --> 02:03:44,791
Cape Verde.

1534
02:03:46,375 --> 02:03:48,791
We struggled to get by.

1535
02:03:49,708 --> 02:03:52,833
Had plenty mouths to feed
on my lowly clerk salary.

1536
02:03:54,125 --> 02:03:58,041
But Diatta was a shining beacon of light.

1537
02:03:58,125 --> 02:03:59,541
Excuse me?

1538
02:04:03,916 --> 02:04:05,291
No, no, no. Her.

1539
02:04:05,375 --> 02:04:07,708
Lucien was her supervising lecturer.

1540
02:04:07,791 --> 02:04:10,458
He saw the potential in her.

1541
02:04:10,541 --> 02:04:14,916
Mentored her, guided her,
secured her a scholarship.

1542
02:04:16,375 --> 02:04:19,208
My family felt indebted to him.

1543
02:04:22,500 --> 02:04:25,500
We considered him
a blessing to our family.

1544
02:04:26,583 --> 02:04:28,250
We prayed for him,

1545
02:04:28,333 --> 02:04:30,166
thanked God for him.

1546
02:04:30,250 --> 02:04:33,958
But, alas,
he was a wolf in sheep's clothing.

1547
02:04:35,333 --> 02:04:39,250
She was a poor girl
from an impoverished family,

1548
02:04:39,333 --> 02:04:42,250
but her education meant the world to her.

1549
02:04:43,333 --> 02:04:46,541
She gave in to him time after time.

1550
02:04:46,625 --> 02:04:49,458
But it was when she
found herself with child

1551
02:04:49,541 --> 02:04:51,875
that he displayed
his brutally true colors.

1552
02:04:56,833 --> 02:05:01,750
Diatta returned to Senegal
a broken woman.

1553
02:05:03,583 --> 02:05:08,041
No matter how much I assured her,

1554
02:05:09,541 --> 02:05:13,083
she felt she had let us down,

1555
02:05:13,791 --> 02:05:15,625
and shamed us.

1556
02:05:16,916 --> 02:05:19,541
Three days after
giving birth to her baby,

1557
02:05:20,666 --> 02:05:24,583
having fed him, rocked him to sleep,

1558
02:05:24,666 --> 02:05:26,750
put him to bed...

1559
02:05:32,791 --> 02:05:35,166
she came to this very spot...

1560
02:05:46,708 --> 02:05:49,416
and returned to her Maker.

1561
02:05:54,375 --> 02:05:56,958
Lucien is a psychopath.

1562
02:05:57,041 --> 02:06:02,541
Maybe growing up with an uncaring father
made him turn that way.

1563
02:06:02,625 --> 02:06:05,333
-Who knows?
-No.

1564
02:06:05,416 --> 02:06:10,166
He's just evil, manipulative, cunning.

1565
02:06:13,541 --> 02:06:15,333
[laughter and indistinct chatter]

1566
02:06:18,208 --> 02:06:20,000
Okay, see you, Remi.

1567
02:06:20,083 --> 02:06:21,333
-See you too.
-Take care.

1568
02:06:23,541 --> 02:06:26,458
[Lucien] This is just impossible,
I can't drive this car.

1569
02:06:31,208 --> 02:06:33,500
Very manipulative indeed.

1570
02:06:37,541 --> 02:06:42,000
Lucien visits his son sometimes...

1571
02:06:42,083 --> 02:06:45,708
but for the most part
he just sends money for his upkeep.

1572
02:06:47,041 --> 02:06:49,958
He secured me a job at the university.

1573
02:06:52,791 --> 02:06:55,541
Samba is his son, right?

1574
02:06:56,750 --> 02:06:58,291
We were bribed...

1575
02:06:59,208 --> 02:07:01,916
to keep our silence,

1576
02:07:02,000 --> 02:07:04,375
to save his job and his family.

1577
02:07:06,166 --> 02:07:11,166
I took the blood money
to feed the rest of my family.

1578
02:07:13,291 --> 02:07:15,291
I've regretted it ever since.

1579
02:07:28,750 --> 02:07:31,708
[in English] When you came, I knew.

1580
02:07:33,791 --> 02:07:38,666
There have been so many,
but nobody wanted to speak up.

1581
02:07:42,791 --> 02:07:44,875
I spoke up.

1582
02:07:46,958 --> 02:07:49,208
I came here for your help,

1583
02:07:49,291 --> 02:07:51,875
but you've suffered enough loss.

1584
02:07:52,833 --> 02:07:53,958
Thank you.

1585
02:08:00,166 --> 02:08:04,500
[in French] Thanks for your time. Goodbye.

1586
02:08:23,625 --> 02:08:25,708
I think we've waited enough.

1587
02:08:27,125 --> 02:08:29,041
We should go ahead.

1588
02:08:29,125 --> 02:08:32,208
Ma'am, your client isn't here.

1589
02:08:32,291 --> 02:08:34,416
I think we are going to have to go ahead.

1590
02:08:35,541 --> 02:08:38,250
We've tried to wait.
We've been considerate here.

1591
02:08:44,125 --> 02:08:46,208
My apologies for my tardiness.

1592
02:08:46,291 --> 02:08:48,791
Okay, this had better be good.

1593
02:08:55,666 --> 02:08:58,958
Madam chair, our witness

1594
02:08:59,041 --> 02:09:03,250
expresses himself better
in French and Portuguese.

1595
02:09:10,625 --> 02:09:13,875
-Portuguese?
-I understand the language.

1596
02:09:13,958 --> 02:09:16,708
-Oh, you do?
-We are good to go

1597
02:09:18,083 --> 02:09:21,333
Okay, fantastic. Please, have a seat.

1598
02:09:29,333 --> 02:09:33,125
I'm sorry, but... why is he here?

1599
02:09:33,208 --> 02:09:34,958
He is completely irrelevant
to this hearing.

1600
02:09:35,583 --> 02:09:38,541
We will be the judge of that,
Professor N'Dyare.

1601
02:09:38,625 --> 02:09:41,000
So please, sit down.

1602
02:09:41,083 --> 02:09:43,500
Excuse me, young lady.

1603
02:09:43,583 --> 02:09:45,541
I possess two Masters degrees...

1604
02:09:46,875 --> 02:09:50,250
a highly published PhD thesis,

1605
02:09:50,333 --> 02:09:55,416
and membership in 18
well-renowned academic fellowships.

1606
02:09:55,500 --> 02:09:58,000
So now, I understand
you are one of the panel here,

1607
02:09:58,083 --> 02:10:01,458
but I strongly suggest
that you adjust your tone

1608
02:10:01,541 --> 02:10:03,375
when addressing me.

1609
02:10:06,416 --> 02:10:09,250
And I am a Rhodes Scholar.

1610
02:10:09,333 --> 02:10:11,458
I possess two PhD's,

1611
02:10:11,541 --> 02:10:13,791
one Doctor of Letter,

1612
02:10:13,875 --> 02:10:18,750
I belong to 23 academic
fellowships across the world,

1613
02:10:18,833 --> 02:10:22,083
and on top of that
I was previously nominated

1614
02:10:22,166 --> 02:10:25,583
for the Nobel Prize in Economics.

1615
02:10:26,291 --> 02:10:29,000
And as the chair of this panel,

1616
02:10:29,083 --> 02:10:32,000
Professor N'Dyare, sit down!

1617
02:10:34,541 --> 02:10:35,750
Sit!

1618
02:10:38,041 --> 02:10:39,375
Thank you.

1619
02:10:44,250 --> 02:10:47,583
Mr. Cardosa? Let's proceed.

1620
02:10:50,916 --> 02:10:54,375
[Portuguese] I am Mr. Vicente Cardosa.

1621
02:10:56,625 --> 02:10:59,416
I work as a laboratory assistant

1622
02:10:59,500 --> 02:11:03,916
at the University in Dakar, Senegal,

1623
02:11:04,000 --> 02:11:07,083
Cheikh Anta Diop.

1624
02:11:07,166 --> 02:11:13,041
I am here to give
testimony at this hearing,

1625
02:11:13,125 --> 02:11:18,333
because I have been an acquaintance
of Professor Lucien N'Dyare

1626
02:11:18,416 --> 02:11:19,916
for many years.

1627
02:11:39,625 --> 02:11:41,958
That was a breakthrough.

1628
02:11:42,041 --> 02:11:44,166
It just might have helped.

1629
02:11:45,833 --> 02:11:47,750
[French] I only wish I acted faster,

1630
02:11:47,833 --> 02:11:49,833
like this young warrior here.

1631
02:11:49,916 --> 02:11:51,833
Thank you so much.

1632
02:11:51,916 --> 02:11:55,083
Continue fighting the good fight.

1633
02:11:55,166 --> 02:11:56,916
You can make a difference.

1634
02:11:59,125 --> 02:12:00,541
Safe trip.

1635
02:12:02,333 --> 02:12:03,458
Thank you.

1636
02:12:08,250 --> 02:12:11,208
How long do you think
the panel will deliberate for?

1637
02:12:11,291 --> 02:12:13,875
They will get in touch.

1638
02:12:14,916 --> 02:12:17,041
We did good in there.

1639
02:12:17,125 --> 02:12:19,208
Keep the faith.

1640
02:12:21,666 --> 02:12:24,291
Somebody is looking for you.

1641
02:12:25,958 --> 02:12:27,833
Thank you so much for your support, ma'am.

1642
02:12:27,916 --> 02:12:29,625
-My pleasure.
-Yeah.

1643
02:13:01,458 --> 02:13:03,208
Miss Oluwa's...

1644
02:13:04,625 --> 02:13:08,750
display of interest
in Professor N'Dyare...

1645
02:13:09,666 --> 02:13:14,500
did it go far beyond
a student-lecturer relationship?

1646
02:13:15,875 --> 02:13:17,500
In any way?

1647
02:13:31,833 --> 02:13:33,291
No.

1648
02:13:54,541 --> 02:13:56,250
I missed you.

1649
02:13:57,541 --> 02:13:59,250
I missed you, too.

1650
02:14:00,166 --> 02:14:01,916
Are you okay?

1651
02:14:19,791 --> 02:14:22,583
[Prof. Lucien] And that goes to
the crux of the economic diversification,

1652
02:14:22,666 --> 02:14:27,125
of the role of the military
in the Egyptian political system.

1653
02:14:27,208 --> 02:14:29,500
That's a very good job, Kwesi.

1654
02:14:29,583 --> 02:14:33,583
Now you can progress
to chapters six and seven.

1655
02:14:33,666 --> 02:14:35,750
Thanks very much, Prof.

1656
02:14:35,833 --> 02:14:38,625
Now, Moremi Oluwa...

1657
02:14:39,416 --> 02:14:41,666
I've gone through
your first five chapters,

1658
02:14:41,750 --> 02:14:45,125
and I must say that
I'm rather disappointed.

1659
02:14:45,208 --> 02:14:48,416
You made a complete departure
from the approved premise.

1660
02:14:48,500 --> 02:14:51,541
There is a distinct lack of citation,

1661
02:14:51,625 --> 02:14:55,875
research, or any real analytical substance
to your hypothesis.

1662
02:14:56,958 --> 02:14:58,666
There's no structure at all.

1663
02:14:59,791 --> 02:15:02,958
Your dissertation
is an unmitigated disaster,

1664
02:15:03,041 --> 02:15:06,916
far below what I expect
from postgraduate work.

1665
02:15:07,000 --> 02:15:08,666
But, sir...

1666
02:15:10,541 --> 02:15:12,333
You need to get back to your premise,

1667
02:15:12,416 --> 02:15:15,333
and remind yourself
what you set out to explore.

1668
02:15:16,666 --> 02:15:18,625
So now I'm taking out...

1669
02:15:20,791 --> 02:15:23,625
your first five chapters,

1670
02:15:23,708 --> 02:15:25,583
and I want you to start again.

1671
02:15:26,833 --> 02:15:29,791
You're going to
have to start all over again.

1672
02:15:29,875 --> 02:15:30,958
From scratch.

1673
02:15:32,166 --> 02:15:34,250
-That's it.
-But, sir!

1674
02:15:34,333 --> 02:15:35,916
Have a good day.

1675
02:15:43,250 --> 02:15:44,625
Sir!

1676
02:15:46,875 --> 02:15:47,958
Sir!

1677
02:15:53,208 --> 02:15:54,916
Professor N'Dyare!

1678
02:15:59,083 --> 02:16:00,833
[French] Why did you do that, sir?

1679
02:16:01,791 --> 02:16:04,208
As I said in class,
your work is below par.

1680
02:16:04,833 --> 02:16:07,083
The other night, in your house,

1681
02:16:07,166 --> 02:16:10,458
you called my work "exemplary."

1682
02:16:12,750 --> 02:16:15,125
I've raised the standard since.

1683
02:16:15,208 --> 02:16:17,500
If you raise the standard,

1684
02:16:17,583 --> 02:16:19,958
it will be impossible for me

1685
02:16:20,041 --> 02:16:24,958
to recover that kind of ground
in time to graduate.

1686
02:16:26,166 --> 02:16:30,000
I'll have to extend my course
for an extra semester.

1687
02:16:30,083 --> 02:16:32,625
And how is that my problem?

1688
02:16:34,333 --> 02:16:37,166
This is all because I turned you down
the other night.

1689
02:16:38,708 --> 02:16:40,791
Don't flatter yourself.

1690
02:16:40,875 --> 02:16:43,958
You tried to force yourself on me.

1691
02:16:46,291 --> 02:16:48,500
It's your word against mine.

1692
02:16:49,583 --> 02:16:51,208
And now...

1693
02:16:51,291 --> 02:16:53,333
you intend to fail me.

1694
02:16:53,416 --> 02:16:56,458
No. You failed yourself.

1695
02:16:57,291 --> 02:17:02,375
But worry not, I believe in you.

1696
02:17:02,458 --> 02:17:08,083
So I'll retain you next semester too.

1697
02:17:09,416 --> 02:17:11,166
I will break you.

1698
02:17:12,541 --> 02:17:14,708
Lucien!

1699
02:17:18,166 --> 02:17:20,208
It's not over yet!

1700
02:17:33,000 --> 02:17:35,250
It's okay. Let's go.

1701
02:17:56,458 --> 02:17:59,041
You won't believe this.

1702
02:17:59,125 --> 02:18:02,125
I got contacted by six women

1703
02:18:02,208 --> 02:18:03,750
who studied in the universities

1704
02:18:03,833 --> 02:18:07,416
of America, in the UK,
in France, in Cape Verde.

1705
02:18:07,500 --> 02:18:10,916
All universities where
Professor N'Dyare taught.

1706
02:18:11,000 --> 02:18:15,291
All six women claimed that they
had been either sexually harassed

1707
02:18:15,375 --> 02:18:20,083
or molested by Professor N'Dyare
whilst he was their lecturer.

1708
02:18:20,166 --> 02:18:21,208
-Oh, my God.
-Now you see?

1709
02:18:21,291 --> 02:18:23,416
You see why I had to make so much noise?

1710
02:18:23,500 --> 02:18:27,000
Your story has given these women
the courage to stand up and be counted.

1711
02:18:27,083 --> 02:18:29,708
Is this good? Can it help?

1712
02:18:30,916 --> 02:18:32,708
I'm so sorry.

1713
02:18:32,791 --> 02:18:34,708
Not in this instance.

1714
02:18:34,791 --> 02:18:39,375
But these testimonies establish
a clear pattern of victimization.

1715
02:18:39,458 --> 02:18:43,875
I know, but we are already at verdict.

1716
02:18:43,958 --> 02:18:46,916
All we can hope for from these testimonies

1717
02:18:47,000 --> 02:18:50,750
is that they will help us
in the court of public opinion

1718
02:18:50,833 --> 02:18:53,416
-if we should lose.
-Lose?

1719
02:18:53,500 --> 02:18:55,416
Jeez!

1720
02:18:55,500 --> 02:18:56,833
I know.

1721
02:18:58,208 --> 02:19:00,166
Okay, come on, let's go.

1722
02:19:05,375 --> 02:19:08,458
Babe, are you good?

1723
02:19:17,250 --> 02:19:20,083
Ma, I will wait right here for you.

1724
02:19:20,166 --> 02:19:21,333
-Okay.
-Yes, Ma.

1725
02:19:21,416 --> 02:19:23,208
Babe, please stay solid for me, okay?

1726
02:19:23,291 --> 02:19:25,833
-Okay.
-It's just going to be fine.

1727
02:19:25,916 --> 02:19:27,541
Come here.

1728
02:19:30,500 --> 02:19:31,958
I love you.

1729
02:19:47,083 --> 02:19:52,000
I'd like to welcome everyone
to the final day of this panel hearing.

1730
02:19:54,333 --> 02:19:55,708
But before we go on,

1731
02:19:55,791 --> 02:20:00,166
I'd like very much to thank everyone
for your part in the whole process.

1732
02:20:00,250 --> 02:20:02,833
Especially the members of the panel.

1733
02:20:02,916 --> 02:20:06,000
Uzoamaka,
thank you very much for your hard work.

1734
02:20:06,750 --> 02:20:10,875
And, uh, Professor Osagie,
very grateful for your diligence

1735
02:20:10,958 --> 02:20:13,291
and your dedication.

1736
02:20:13,375 --> 02:20:17,750
Professor Yahaya, thank you very much
for being such a great support.

1737
02:20:17,833 --> 02:20:22,583
And Dr. Mrs. Nwosu, very appreciative
of all the hard work that you put in.

1738
02:20:25,291 --> 02:20:26,791
Our decision.

1739
02:20:28,875 --> 02:20:31,500
In the complaint of Miss Moremi Oluwa

1740
02:20:31,583 --> 02:20:34,416
versus Professor Lucien N'Dyare...

1741
02:20:35,583 --> 02:20:38,458
the panel members of
this university senate hearing

1742
02:20:39,375 --> 02:20:42,750
have meticulously studied the facts,

1743
02:20:42,833 --> 02:20:45,666
evidence, and witness accounts

1744
02:20:45,750 --> 02:20:48,583
which has been presented by all parties.

1745
02:20:48,666 --> 02:20:52,541
We also took the liberty
of sending the first five chapters

1746
02:20:52,625 --> 02:20:59,291
of Miss Oluwa's dissertation to
an independent expert for consideration.

1747
02:20:59,375 --> 02:21:03,208
Based on all the aforementioned,
and our deliberations,

1748
02:21:03,291 --> 02:21:06,041
we have reached our conclusions.

1749
02:21:11,458 --> 02:21:14,500
We therefore conclude unanimously...

1750
02:21:15,458 --> 02:21:16,875
that Professor N'Dyare...

1751
02:21:19,291 --> 02:21:20,833
is guilty...

1752
02:21:21,583 --> 02:21:23,583
of sexual harassment,

1753
02:21:24,583 --> 02:21:27,458
abuse of power and privileges...

1754
02:21:28,208 --> 02:21:34,375
unethical and immoral behavior
unbecoming of a member of faculty

1755
02:21:34,458 --> 02:21:37,416
of this great institution
of higher learning.

1756
02:21:40,041 --> 02:21:44,208
Professor N'Dyare's
employment with the university

1757
02:21:44,291 --> 02:21:47,125
is hereby terminated
with immediate effect.

1758
02:21:47,208 --> 02:21:53,208
As some of these offences fall
within the framework of criminal activity,

1759
02:21:53,291 --> 02:21:57,125
this complaint will be passed on
to the office of the state prosecutor

1760
02:21:57,208 --> 02:21:59,291
for further action.

1761
02:22:00,458 --> 02:22:03,833
Miss Oluwa, you are hereby exonerated

1762
02:22:03,916 --> 02:22:06,625
of any wrongdoing in this matter.

1763
02:22:06,708 --> 02:22:08,750
-We did it.
-We did it.

1764
02:22:08,833 --> 02:22:10,125
-Yes!
-We did it!

1765
02:22:11,291 --> 02:22:13,916
Can we please complete our assignment.

1766
02:22:14,000 --> 02:22:15,458
Thank you.

1767
02:22:15,541 --> 02:22:19,666
I'd like to thank the members of the panel
for your work once again.

1768
02:22:19,750 --> 02:22:22,458
And I'd like to say
that our work is done here.

1769
02:22:22,541 --> 02:22:24,208
Thank you very much.

1770
02:22:28,583 --> 02:22:30,958
We won! We won!

1771
02:22:34,041 --> 02:22:35,583
Auntie...

1772
02:22:37,541 --> 02:22:39,041
thank you.

1773
02:22:46,083 --> 02:22:47,833
All right, let's go.

1774
02:22:47,916 --> 02:22:49,666
Mummy, thank you so much.

1775
02:22:51,875 --> 02:22:53,583
Yes!

1776
02:22:53,666 --> 02:22:55,666
Baby, I love you!

1777
02:22:55,750 --> 02:22:58,958
I swear with all of my heart!

1778
02:23:00,041 --> 02:23:01,416
Yeah!

1779
02:23:01,500 --> 02:23:03,875
[all cheering]

1780
02:23:18,583 --> 02:23:21,000
No sex for grades!

1781
02:23:24,083 --> 02:23:25,666
No sex for grades!

1782
02:23:32,958 --> 02:23:35,541
Moremi, how do you feel
about your vindication?

1783
02:23:35,625 --> 02:23:37,541
Moremi, does your victory
now leave the door open

1784
02:23:37,625 --> 02:23:39,625
for you to take on the professor
in a criminal court?

1785
02:23:39,708 --> 02:23:42,416
What do you have to say
to other women worldwide in your position?

1786
02:23:44,000 --> 02:23:45,625
Go ahead.

1787
02:23:50,375 --> 02:23:52,208
First of all...

1788
02:23:52,291 --> 02:23:54,000
I want to thank God

1789
02:23:54,083 --> 02:23:58,166
-and the female advocacy NGO...
-Ajike.

1790
02:24:00,958 --> 02:24:03,916
...for helping me
through this troubling journey.

1791
02:24:05,291 --> 02:24:08,250
I'm just a girl trying to go to school

1792
02:24:08,333 --> 02:24:10,125
in order to attain a dream.

1793
02:24:10,208 --> 02:24:14,166
It was never my intention
to become the poster face

1794
02:24:14,250 --> 02:24:16,291
for sexual harassment on campuses.

1795
02:24:16,375 --> 02:24:21,666
But it is a hat I am proud
and willing to wear.

1796
02:24:23,791 --> 02:24:28,208
I hope my victory serves
as a clarion call for change,

1797
02:24:28,291 --> 02:24:33,583
and I hope my victory gives a voice
to the silent girls or women

1798
02:24:33,666 --> 02:24:36,083
in all walks of life

1799
02:24:36,166 --> 02:24:40,041
facing sexual harassment
just due to their gender.

1800
02:24:40,125 --> 02:24:42,208
-Thank you.
-All right.

1801
02:24:42,291 --> 02:24:45,166
-Greatest Nigerian students!
-[all cheering]

1802
02:24:56,291 --> 02:24:57,750
[Prof. Osagie] Hence...

1803
02:24:57,833 --> 02:25:01,041
international waters...

1804
02:25:03,250 --> 02:25:04,583
are considered...

1805
02:25:05,916 --> 02:25:08,875
as part and parcel of...

1806
02:25:09,833 --> 02:25:12,875
a borderline of a sovereign state.

1807
02:25:15,541 --> 02:25:19,208
Any incursion into these waters...

1808
02:25:21,750 --> 02:25:23,416
is considered...

1809
02:25:24,958 --> 02:25:26,750
a breach...

1810
02:25:26,833 --> 02:25:30,250
of the sovereign state.

1811
02:25:32,458 --> 02:25:33,708
Albeit...

1812
02:25:34,708 --> 02:25:40,375
a vessel may be as far away
as 12 nautical miles...

1813
02:25:41,083 --> 02:25:42,583
from the shoreline.

1814
02:25:44,166 --> 02:25:45,666
And then if...

1815
02:26:02,583 --> 02:26:04,208
Sorry I'm late, sir.
