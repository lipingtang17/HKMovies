1
00:07:13,916 --> 00:07:16,458
Why are you hounding her?
Are you the one paying her school fees?

2
00:07:32,791 --> 00:07:34,916
But that is the difference,
you are a dullard.

3
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,375
You know what I mean,
like a compound dullard.

4
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,125
I guess that makes me Nigerian.

5
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:37,750
Two punches.

6
00:14:42,625 --> 00:14:43,875
Three punches.

7
00:15:53,083 --> 00:15:53,916
My elder brother.

8
00:16:11,875 --> 00:16:14,291
My name is Moremi.

9
00:16:19,208 --> 00:16:20,500
So you can speak Yoruba?

10
00:16:21,458 --> 00:16:23,708
You are saying it
like you are speaking the Egun dialect.

11
00:16:27,041 --> 00:16:28,041
My ball.

12
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:32,750
Where were you during freshers week?

13
00:16:38,416 --> 00:16:41,208
What were you looking
for during freshers week?

14
00:18:26,666 --> 00:18:28,125
No, no. Excuse me.

15
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:41,208
Yeah, how can I help you?

16
00:19:46,625 --> 00:19:47,458
First of all...

17
00:19:55,375 --> 00:19:56,625
I have been searching for you.

18
00:19:57,625 --> 00:20:01,458
I have looked everywhere for you.
I went to every department, every faculty,

19
00:20:01,541 --> 00:20:03,041
even every cafeteria.

20
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:05,541
And then it dawned on me...

21
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:14,166
God, as if the ground should open up
and swallow me.

22
00:20:17,333 --> 00:20:20,958
No need. I'd push you in myself.

23
00:20:23,708 --> 00:20:28,500
-"I'm Koyejo. Final year med school."
-She got me.

24
00:20:39,916 --> 00:20:41,833
Do you still want me to push you
in the ground?

25
00:20:41,916 --> 00:20:44,375
Please, please don't be angry.
Don't push me into it.

26
00:20:44,875 --> 00:20:46,208
Don't push me into it.

27
00:27:17,708 --> 00:27:20,791
This is impossible,
I can't drive this car.

28
00:27:22,458 --> 00:27:24,125
What a mess.

29
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,875
I can see that you're having issues
with your car.

30
00:27:32,583 --> 00:27:33,666
You speak French?

31
00:27:34,416 --> 00:27:37,791
Yes. I have a French
baccalaureate qualification.

32
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:43,250
Did you take any electives
in mechanical engineering?

33
00:27:51,291 --> 00:27:52,250
I must tell you...

34
00:27:55,791 --> 00:27:57,375
I don't want you to make fun of me.

35
00:28:02,291 --> 00:28:06,541
I learned how to drive in America
on an automatic gear shift.

36
00:28:06,625 --> 00:28:11,208
But this university
loaned me a car with a stick shift.

37
00:28:19,875 --> 00:28:21,208
Your car key, sir?

38
00:28:23,375 --> 00:28:24,583
What do you intend on doing?

39
00:28:30,666 --> 00:28:31,500
Shall we?

40
00:28:58,791 --> 00:29:00,166
Where are you heading?

41
00:29:01,041 --> 00:29:03,000
-Road 8.
-Okay.

42
00:29:20,541 --> 00:29:22,875
Sir, you've got to understand...

43
00:29:29,291 --> 00:29:34,250
I think it's just
too much information and jargon.

44
00:29:34,333 --> 00:29:36,500
An automatic is much easier.

45
00:29:37,041 --> 00:29:38,750
But with manual,

46
00:30:23,708 --> 00:30:25,875
-Thank you so much.
-You're very welcome, sir.

47
00:30:26,916 --> 00:30:31,291
I have to ask the university for a driver
or get an automatic car instead.

48
00:30:31,708 --> 00:30:33,333
Just practice. It makes perfect.

49
00:30:34,916 --> 00:30:37,541
If you continue to teach me,
then no problem.

50
00:30:43,208 --> 00:30:46,208
Please come in. Least I can do is offer
you a drink, some refreshments maybe?

51
00:30:46,666 --> 00:30:49,916
That's okay. I was heading
to the supermarket when I ran into you.

52
00:30:50,833 --> 00:30:52,208
But it's a long way from here.

53
00:30:56,875 --> 00:30:57,708
Goodbye.

54
00:39:50,916 --> 00:39:52,541
-Okay, all right.
-Yeah.

55
00:39:56,583 --> 00:39:58,708
I don't know why, it keeps stalling.

56
00:39:59,458 --> 00:40:00,291
Calm down.

57
00:40:03,291 --> 00:40:06,208
There has to be a balance

58
00:40:06,291 --> 00:40:08,958
between the accelerator and the clutch.

59
00:40:09,375 --> 00:40:13,375
There is no logic to this.
We have two legs, why make three pedals?

60
00:40:13,458 --> 00:40:14,291
It's ridiculous.

61
00:40:14,791 --> 00:40:15,708
Listen.

62
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:36,458
Don't forget...

63
00:40:44,750 --> 00:40:46,458
Perfect! Brilliant!

64
00:40:50,291 --> 00:40:52,833
Well done. Okay.

65
00:40:56,541 --> 00:40:58,083
-Like this?
-Perfect.

66
00:40:58,541 --> 00:41:00,750
Very good.
You're really getting the hang of it.

67
00:41:00,833 --> 00:41:02,291
-Okay, great.
-That works.

68
00:41:46,291 --> 00:41:49,125
I can see that you're now an expert.

69
00:41:50,875 --> 00:41:54,583
Thanks to you.
You were very patient with me.

70
00:41:54,666 --> 00:41:56,500
-Thank you.
-My pleasure, sir.

71
00:41:57,833 --> 00:42:00,250
I love to resolve conflicts.

72
00:42:00,833 --> 00:42:03,291
Conflicts? Which conflicts
are we talking about?

73
00:42:04,750 --> 00:42:07,000
-There's no conflict.
-Sir,

74
00:42:15,416 --> 00:42:18,708
What was it like working at the UN?

75
00:42:19,416 --> 00:42:20,500
Working at the UN?

76
00:42:21,041 --> 00:42:22,916
It's nice but quite stressful.

77
00:42:23,750 --> 00:42:26,500
When you're working for a common goal,

78
00:42:26,583 --> 00:42:29,000
people will want
to frustrate your efforts.

79
00:42:30,125 --> 00:42:32,750
For as long as I can remember,

80
00:42:35,750 --> 00:42:36,583
You?

81
00:42:37,375 --> 00:42:41,125
Somehow I saw an academic in you.

82
00:42:41,208 --> 00:42:42,916
Well, first of all,

83
00:42:46,375 --> 00:42:47,625
Then secondly...

84
00:43:12,250 --> 00:43:14,250
A photojournalist who could do nothing

85
00:43:14,333 --> 00:43:17,583
but stand aside
to record the image for posterity.

86
00:43:26,083 --> 00:43:30,666
It haunted the photographer too.
He committed suicide a year later.

87
00:43:40,208 --> 00:43:42,750
Like your namesake Moremi Ajasoro?

88
00:43:46,916 --> 00:43:48,208
You've read about her?

89
00:43:48,875 --> 00:43:50,375
Of course, I did my research.

90
00:43:51,541 --> 00:43:53,583
Infiltrated the ranks
of the Ugbo forest tribe,

91
00:43:55,083 --> 00:43:57,791
discovered their weakness and...

92
00:43:59,458 --> 00:44:04,125
saved her people of Ile-Ife from invasion.

93
00:44:04,208 --> 00:44:06,083
She was quite the heroine.

94
00:44:08,333 --> 00:44:10,333
I can only aspire.

95
00:44:10,916 --> 00:44:12,666
We all aspire, my dear.

96
00:44:13,291 --> 00:44:17,416
But sometimes a prophet is without honor
only in his hometown.

97
00:44:24,500 --> 00:44:25,791
Would you like to take a walk?

98
00:44:26,583 --> 00:44:27,416
Yes.

99
00:44:52,416 --> 00:44:54,583
You and I, we are new age rebels.

100
00:44:58,041 --> 00:44:59,208
We ruffle feathers.

101
00:48:49,041 --> 00:48:50,625
Please, please, please.

102
00:50:39,125 --> 00:50:41,541
Please. I don't do lecturers.

103
00:50:46,625 --> 00:50:48,083
You're too extra, please.

104
00:51:24,125 --> 00:51:26,250
-My pal.
-My brother.

105
00:51:26,333 --> 00:51:27,416
-Thank you.
-How are you?

106
00:51:30,250 --> 00:51:31,833
You shall grow old and live long.

107
00:51:35,875 --> 00:51:38,416
Charlie, hope you're enjoying Nigeria?

108
00:51:44,958 --> 00:51:47,000
Yetty, please bring the cake.

109
00:51:53,333 --> 00:51:54,166
Have it.

110
00:51:54,250 --> 00:51:55,750
-Treat her well.
-I will.

111
00:51:58,500 --> 00:52:00,416
-Enjoy.
-I hail!

112
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:10,208
It's amazing.

113
00:52:36,750 --> 00:52:38,625
That was superb.

114
00:52:38,708 --> 00:52:40,291
Seun is my friend anyways.

115
00:53:45,583 --> 00:53:46,458
Money

116
00:53:47,541 --> 00:53:48,708
We use our feet to fight

117
00:53:49,375 --> 00:53:50,208
Money

118
00:53:53,250 --> 00:53:54,333
Money, money

119
00:53:57,083 --> 00:53:57,916
Money

120
00:54:00,708 --> 00:54:02,083
Money, money

121
00:54:06,875 --> 00:54:10,333
They've arrived, they've arrived

122
00:54:10,875 --> 00:54:14,416
They've arrived, they've arrived

123
00:54:14,916 --> 00:54:18,291
They've arrived, they've arrived

124
00:55:24,416 --> 00:55:26,750
Put them together, give me the answer

125
00:57:00,708 --> 00:57:04,375
You see, in karate,
there are different stages.

126
00:57:04,458 --> 00:57:05,708
Are you listening?

127
00:57:25,500 --> 00:57:27,583
Is it not all about fighting Chinese?

128
00:57:44,250 --> 00:57:45,666
Are you listening?

129
00:57:47,875 --> 00:57:49,250
-Do you understand?
-Okay.

130
00:58:34,666 --> 00:58:36,916
I hope you're not using style
to tap current.

131
00:59:06,541 --> 00:59:08,291
Wait, calm down, okay.

132
00:59:08,875 --> 00:59:10,416
-Go on, try it.
-Okay.

133
00:59:14,625 --> 00:59:16,416
-Relax.
-Relax what?

134
00:59:16,500 --> 00:59:18,500
-Relax.
-Don't damage my family planning.

135
00:59:34,666 --> 00:59:36,166
I saw you on Thursday.

136
00:59:53,375 --> 00:59:55,458
Seeing you with him like that.
Are you listening?

137
01:00:00,500 --> 01:00:02,500
I don't like it.

138
01:00:10,208 --> 01:00:14,666
You know how some men see
over-familiarity as a green light.

139
01:02:09,708 --> 01:02:14,916
I assumed that if I had a presupposition,

140
01:02:16,083 --> 01:02:20,708
I have to defend it
with research and citations.

141
01:02:20,791 --> 01:02:22,541
Yeah, with original content.

142
01:02:23,166 --> 01:02:28,458
I like your premise,
and your first chapter is excellent.

143
01:02:29,083 --> 01:02:32,125
But for chapters two and three,
I am not so sure.

144
01:02:32,208 --> 01:02:34,708
It talks more of the situation
from a third party's point of view

145
01:02:34,791 --> 01:02:35,750
than it does from yours.

146
01:02:35,833 --> 01:02:40,916
It's like, whose dissertation is this?
Is it yours or your source?

147
01:02:41,458 --> 01:02:45,708
Aside from that,
let me hear your hypothesis.

148
01:02:46,083 --> 01:02:47,958
Take note of my comments in red.

149
01:02:50,708 --> 01:02:51,541
Okay.

150
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:53,125
Thank you, professor.

151
01:02:53,875 --> 01:02:54,875
Professor?

152
01:02:54,958 --> 01:02:59,166
When it's just you and I together,
you can call me Lucien.

153
01:03:00,125 --> 01:03:03,750
I'm not entirely sure
that would be appropriate.

154
01:03:05,708 --> 01:03:06,541
But I insist.

155
01:03:08,750 --> 01:03:12,541
I'd rather maintain the status quo.

156
01:03:16,583 --> 01:03:22,375
My old supervising professor at Harvard,
I called him David.

157
01:03:27,625 --> 01:03:29,250
And I am Lucien.

158
01:03:29,916 --> 01:03:31,708
And I am Nigerian.

159
01:03:32,083 --> 01:03:33,041
The moment

160
01:03:33,958 --> 01:03:39,708
I call someone
of your age difference by name,

161
01:03:39,791 --> 01:03:42,041
it means I have...

162
01:03:43,958 --> 01:03:45,583
I have stopped respecting you.

163
01:03:47,375 --> 01:03:51,166
Why are you always so defensive?

164
01:03:51,250 --> 01:03:52,083
You know...

165
01:03:59,916 --> 01:04:01,833
I was the tutor then, in control.

166
01:04:03,291 --> 01:04:04,291
Then, relax.

167
01:04:07,916 --> 01:04:09,208
Do you have a boyfriend?

168
01:04:12,916 --> 01:04:13,750
Yes.

169
01:04:14,916 --> 01:04:15,958
The medical student?

170
01:04:16,708 --> 01:04:18,291
How do you know?

171
01:04:21,166 --> 01:04:22,000
I know.

172
01:04:23,875 --> 01:04:25,916
And with your boyfriend,

173
01:04:27,166 --> 01:04:28,583
are you also in control?

174
01:04:31,416 --> 01:04:35,166
That's not something
I am comfortable discussing with you.

175
01:04:37,541 --> 01:04:42,083
So, you can talk to me about the economic
effect of Brexit within the European Union

176
01:04:42,166 --> 01:04:45,041
but your sex life is a no-go area?
Come on.

177
01:04:46,041 --> 01:04:47,083
So, it is forbidden?

178
01:04:50,208 --> 01:04:51,875
Now you've really got me curious.

179
01:05:15,458 --> 01:05:18,916
If that's all, I want to leave.

180
01:05:21,375 --> 01:05:22,583
That will be all.

181
01:05:40,375 --> 01:05:43,208
My favorite color is red.

182
01:07:51,791 --> 01:07:53,333
It's a field trip.

183
01:07:54,416 --> 01:07:56,416
It's part of my course requirements.

184
01:08:03,666 --> 01:08:06,166
The same lecturer who tried to figure out
your sexual preference?

185
01:08:06,250 --> 01:08:08,500
Come on.
It wasn't quite like that, Koyejo.

186
01:08:08,583 --> 01:08:09,583
Okay.

187
01:08:10,083 --> 01:08:13,833
You're the one who came running to me
with complaints.

188
01:08:13,916 --> 01:08:16,583
You told me the professor
was talking inappropriately.

189
01:08:20,041 --> 01:08:22,208
Maybe I overreacted.

190
01:08:23,750 --> 01:08:26,375
Maybe you don't want
to read the writing on the wall.

191
01:08:28,208 --> 01:08:31,875
That was over a month ago.
But now everything's been cool since then.

192
01:08:53,416 --> 01:08:56,208
Join another tutorial group.
Do you understand?

193
01:08:56,625 --> 01:08:59,583
You guys are not the only group
going on a field trip.

194
01:09:04,666 --> 01:09:08,708
I'm not here to ask your permission.
I came to inform you.

195
01:09:16,541 --> 01:09:17,833
So, it's like that?

196
01:11:02,166 --> 01:11:03,416
Good to see you.

197
01:11:03,500 --> 01:11:07,500
I'm pleased to see you too,
our traveling professor.

198
01:11:07,583 --> 01:11:09,500
-In fact, in fact.
-It's been an age.

199
01:11:09,583 --> 01:11:11,333
Indeed, good to see you.

200
01:11:12,250 --> 01:11:16,708
And this must be the Nigerian tribe
that has adopted you.

201
01:11:17,125 --> 01:11:18,541
In fact, in fact.

202
01:11:23,583 --> 01:11:26,750
This time around, I brought ten students.

203
01:11:26,833 --> 01:11:29,208
I must say they are all exceptional.

204
01:11:30,375 --> 01:11:34,375
The goal is to share some
of this Senegalese culture with them,

205
01:11:34,458 --> 01:11:37,500
-and to tour them around Dakar.
-That's very good.

206
01:11:59,916 --> 01:12:00,750
Not too old.

207
01:12:02,500 --> 01:12:03,583
You're correct.

208
01:12:03,666 --> 01:12:07,166
-A very warm welcome to you all.
-Thank you.

209
01:12:07,250 --> 01:12:12,791
I'll be hosting a reception for you
at the dean's lodge this evening,

210
01:12:12,875 --> 01:12:16,541
where you can meet some
of your Senegalese colleagues.

211
01:12:22,083 --> 01:12:23,083
Thank you.

212
01:12:23,166 --> 01:12:25,875
-Is anyone fluent in French?
-French?

213
01:12:27,208 --> 01:12:29,750
-She's my brightest star.
-Yes.

214
01:12:29,833 --> 01:12:33,166
She speaks French fluently, Moremi.

215
01:12:35,458 --> 01:12:37,375
-It's nice to meet you, Moremi.
-Good day.

216
01:12:37,458 --> 01:12:40,458
-How are you?
-I am fine, thank you.

217
01:12:40,541 --> 01:12:41,708
I am delighted.

218
01:12:42,125 --> 01:12:46,750
You will be the official interpreter.

219
01:12:46,833 --> 01:12:49,166
Yes, okay, with all pleasure, sir.

220
01:12:49,250 --> 01:12:52,250
-That's good.
-Thanks a lot.

221
01:12:52,541 --> 01:12:56,916
All right! I will be waiting
when you all are done for today.

222
01:13:00,666 --> 01:13:02,583
See you tonight.

223
01:13:02,666 --> 01:13:04,958
-Thank you, doctor.
-I'm going for an appointment now.

224
01:13:05,958 --> 01:13:07,791
-Very well. See you later.
-Yes.

225
01:15:26,333 --> 01:15:28,875
-My translator.
-Good evening, sir.

226
01:15:28,958 --> 01:15:30,958
-How are you?
-I'm fine. Thank you.

227
01:15:31,041 --> 01:15:33,750
-I hope you are having a good time.
-Thank you.

228
01:16:21,166 --> 01:16:22,958
So near yet so far.

229
01:16:24,875 --> 01:16:25,750
I'm fine.

230
01:16:26,916 --> 01:16:30,750
I know that look, lovers tiff.

231
01:16:31,541 --> 01:16:34,916
Don't let anyone spoil
this wonderful experience for you.

232
01:16:35,583 --> 01:16:37,916
Don't believe a word this man says.

233
01:16:38,916 --> 01:16:41,958
I taught him everything he knows.

234
01:16:44,833 --> 01:16:45,833
Professor.

235
01:17:13,916 --> 01:17:15,833
I hope you enjoyed yourself?

236
01:17:16,166 --> 01:17:18,083
Yes, everything was great. Thank you.

237
01:17:20,458 --> 01:17:22,125
-As you can see...
-What's that?

238
01:17:22,916 --> 01:17:24,541
I kept your old Peugeot for you.

239
01:17:24,625 --> 01:17:29,666
-Really? You should have sold the jalopy.
-No. You used to love driving it.

240
01:17:30,875 --> 01:17:32,666
Thanks for hosting us tonight.

241
01:17:33,750 --> 01:17:37,291
-So, we would see you very soon.
Okay. Thanks, uncle.

242
01:17:37,375 --> 01:17:39,833
-My translator.
-Thanks a lot, sir.

243
01:17:40,541 --> 01:17:42,458
-Very good.
-Goodbye.

244
01:17:43,208 --> 01:17:44,333
Goodbye, everyone.

245
01:17:46,875 --> 01:17:47,791
In conclusion...

246
01:17:49,291 --> 01:17:52,875
it is imperative to weigh

247
01:17:53,458 --> 01:17:59,125
the social ramification
of the imposing of economic sanctions

248
01:17:59,208 --> 01:18:01,125
vis-a-vis the political issues
in that country.

249
01:18:07,041 --> 01:18:10,000
Otherwise, an embargo will do
more harm than good.

250
01:18:10,500 --> 01:18:15,416
That's it. So, professor,
finally, thanks once again.

251
01:18:15,875 --> 01:18:18,000
-Thank you, too.
-Thanks for the privilege.

252
01:18:18,583 --> 01:18:20,500
Dear students, thank you.

253
01:18:20,583 --> 01:18:22,833
Thank you to my Nigerian students.

254
01:18:24,500 --> 01:18:26,125
-Thank you, sir.
-Thank you.

255
01:20:00,125 --> 01:20:03,000
It's called the statue
of the Liberation of Slaves.

256
01:20:55,958 --> 01:20:56,916
Good afternoon.

257
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:58,125
Good day.

258
01:20:58,208 --> 01:21:00,250
What is your name?

259
01:21:10,750 --> 01:21:12,541
Where are we going?

260
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:46,250
Beautiful.

261
01:22:57,416 --> 01:22:58,541
It's unbelievable.

262
01:22:59,541 --> 01:23:01,791
Even more beautiful at night.

263
01:23:03,041 --> 01:23:05,000
This probably is the best view
of the country.

264
01:23:07,708 --> 01:23:09,375
I want you to...

265
01:23:10,666 --> 01:23:13,583
bask in the serenity of the view

266
01:23:13,666 --> 01:23:16,208
before the others arrive with their noise
and camera phones.

267
01:23:16,291 --> 01:23:17,208
That's it.

268
01:23:18,208 --> 01:23:21,250
I'll give you a few minutes,
then bring your colleagues, enjoy.

269
01:23:21,333 --> 01:23:23,041
Don't go, not yet professor.

270
01:23:28,583 --> 01:23:30,541
This is my village. I grew up here.

271
01:23:31,541 --> 01:23:34,291
-But you never mentioned it.
-Right.

272
01:23:35,416 --> 01:23:37,375
As a child,
I grew up without a shirt on my back.

273
01:23:38,500 --> 01:23:41,208
My father was the local market inspector,

274
01:23:41,291 --> 01:23:46,291
a drunk who spent his earnings
on drink and women,

275
01:23:47,416 --> 01:23:52,083
while my mother and I lived destitute,
from hand to mouth.

276
01:23:53,583 --> 01:23:58,791
When I was in despair,
I would stand here at this very spot

277
01:24:00,250 --> 01:24:02,041
then imagine that...

278
01:24:03,250 --> 01:24:05,208
if I could just spread my wings...

279
01:24:08,458 --> 01:24:11,166
I could conquer the whole world.

280
01:24:22,916 --> 01:24:25,500
I will take my leave now.

281
01:24:26,833 --> 01:24:27,708
Thank you.

282
01:29:50,583 --> 01:29:51,500
Hello.

283
01:29:53,500 --> 01:29:54,875
Good day, professor.

284
01:29:56,416 --> 01:29:58,125
You're alone.

285
01:29:59,500 --> 01:30:01,291
I just needed some space.

286
01:30:03,875 --> 01:30:05,916
Well, plenty of space here.

287
01:30:08,416 --> 01:30:10,041
Historical sources claim that...

288
01:30:15,083 --> 01:30:17,750
over a million African slaves
were shipped.

289
01:30:19,916 --> 01:30:22,541
It makes me wonder

290
01:30:22,625 --> 01:30:27,500
how many secrets
are buried out in that sea.

291
01:30:29,583 --> 01:30:30,583
The doctor?

292
01:30:38,625 --> 01:30:41,375
If he was dumb enough to let you go,

293
01:30:41,458 --> 01:30:46,333
then he was never smart enough
to have you in the first place.

294
01:30:52,583 --> 01:30:54,125
I'm sorry.

295
01:33:18,291 --> 01:33:20,666
You certainly picked a good catch
in the market. I won’t lie.

296
01:33:40,583 --> 01:33:44,000
About what happened in Cape Verde...

297
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:47,208
I'd rather not talk about that, sir.

298
01:33:50,541 --> 01:33:54,458
I acted inappropriately.
I don't know what came over me.

299
01:33:54,541 --> 01:34:01,541
It was a moment of weakness
that now I find utterly embarrassing.

300
01:34:03,875 --> 01:34:04,958
My profound apology.

301
01:34:08,958 --> 01:34:10,375
So you will return to class?

302
01:34:11,791 --> 01:34:13,000
Yes.

303
01:36:01,458 --> 01:36:03,583
We're not supposed to be speaking.

304
01:36:05,708 --> 01:36:06,791
Even you?

305
01:36:09,750 --> 01:36:10,875
It's shocking.

306
01:36:19,916 --> 01:36:26,166
I warned you not to get over-familiar
with that man. You ignored me.

307
01:36:27,708 --> 01:36:30,375
I told you not to go to Dakar.
You stubbornly went.

308
01:43:09,291 --> 01:43:11,666
Where is everyone?

309
01:43:13,583 --> 01:43:16,041
They left. I thought you had gone too.

310
01:43:17,166 --> 01:43:19,416
Something I ate.

311
01:43:19,500 --> 01:43:23,208
Maybe it was my Senegalese jollof rice.

312
01:43:24,500 --> 01:43:25,625
Are you all right now?

313
01:43:25,708 --> 01:43:26,625
Better.

314
01:43:27,750 --> 01:43:31,500
Thanks for a lovely evening. I should go.

315
01:43:31,583 --> 01:43:32,708
No problem.

316
01:43:34,833 --> 01:43:40,958
Please, can you at least help me clear up
before you go?

317
01:43:41,958 --> 01:43:42,833
Okay.

318
01:43:43,833 --> 01:43:44,791
Thank you.

319
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:51,791
I wasn't going to reveal it here and now,

320
01:43:51,875 --> 01:43:55,750
but I have approved
the first five chapters of your thesis.

321
01:43:56,541 --> 01:43:59,625
You came up with some fascinating theories

322
01:43:59,708 --> 01:44:03,458
on conflict resolution in the Middle East.

323
01:44:03,541 --> 01:44:05,125
Exceptional.

324
01:44:05,208 --> 01:44:07,166
I don't know what to say.

325
01:44:08,833 --> 01:44:12,916
I'm pretty certain you're going to say
thank you when I tell you that

326
01:44:13,000 --> 01:44:16,125
I've also referred you
to a high-ranking colleague at the UN.

327
01:44:17,583 --> 01:44:19,291
There will be an interview waiting for you

328
01:44:19,375 --> 01:44:22,125
in New York once you complete
your postgraduate studies.

329
01:44:23,208 --> 01:44:24,666
Thank you so much.

330
01:44:30,458 --> 01:44:32,875
It's okay. Keep up the good work.

331
01:44:32,958 --> 01:44:34,833
I'm so sorry.

332
01:44:36,041 --> 01:44:37,541
It's okay.

333
01:44:37,625 --> 01:44:41,458
No problem...

334
01:44:45,583 --> 01:44:48,916
You look ravishing this evening.

335
01:44:50,500 --> 01:44:51,625
Thank you.

336
01:44:53,708 --> 01:44:57,916
Do you mind? Let me have your hand.
Come on, come closer.

337
01:45:00,333 --> 01:45:01,916
What do you think you're doing?

338
01:45:03,291 --> 01:45:06,333
You know that I...

339
01:45:07,750 --> 01:45:09,000
Stop pretending.

340
01:45:11,208 --> 01:45:12,833
Why are you pretending?

341
01:45:14,250 --> 01:45:16,041
Please let me go!

342
01:45:16,125 --> 01:45:19,916
But you have been staring
at me all evening.

343
01:45:20,916 --> 01:45:22,666
-Teasing me with your eyes.
-No!

344
01:45:22,750 --> 01:45:24,583
See how you are dressed.

345
01:45:24,666 --> 01:45:27,750
You wore this to seduce me.
You intentionally stayed back.

346
01:45:27,833 --> 01:45:29,041
No, I didn't.

347
01:45:30,625 --> 01:45:33,375
Stop the pretense! Be still!

348
01:45:34,583 --> 01:45:36,666
You wore this dress to seduce me.

349
01:45:36,750 --> 01:45:38,750
Please don't hurt me.

350
01:45:38,833 --> 01:45:41,125
Can't you see that I care about you
too much to harm you?

351
01:45:41,208 --> 01:45:42,375
I promise to be gentle.

352
01:45:43,541 --> 01:45:44,958
Then why are you staring at me?

353
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:49,083
Stop it! Stop this!

354
01:45:49,166 --> 01:45:50,041
Be still!

355
01:45:51,041 --> 01:45:53,750
You wore this dress to seduce me.

356
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:01,375
Why are you pretending?

357
01:46:02,375 --> 01:46:03,208
Keep quiet!

358
01:46:10,250 --> 01:46:11,541
Be calm.

359
01:46:15,000 --> 01:46:18,583
All right. I will be gentle and slow.

360
01:46:22,750 --> 01:46:24,666
I'm going to be very gentle.

361
01:47:26,291 --> 01:47:27,291
My dear.

362
01:47:39,041 --> 01:47:40,708
It's not over yet!

363
01:51:54,583 --> 01:51:56,666
Don't walk too near the edge of the cliff

364
01:51:56,750 --> 01:52:00,000
in case the wind blows the wrong way
and tumbles you over.

365
01:52:44,208 --> 01:52:45,291
Please excuse me.

366
01:52:45,375 --> 01:52:51,041
I'm looking for a lecturer who works here.
His name is Cardosa.

367
01:52:51,125 --> 01:52:52,250
Cardosa?

368
01:52:52,333 --> 01:52:55,416
Sorry, there's no lecturer
bearing that name here.

369
01:52:55,500 --> 01:52:57,750
Oh, I'm sure that was his name.

370
01:52:57,833 --> 01:53:00,666
He had it written on his lab coat.

371
01:53:00,791 --> 01:53:03,916
He must be a laboratory assistant.

372
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:06,625
He can't be a lecturer
because they don't wear name labels.

373
01:53:07,500 --> 01:53:10,291
-Okay.
-But they don't work weekends.

374
01:53:12,625 --> 01:53:13,541
Thank you.

375
01:53:46,250 --> 01:53:50,333
As you can see,
I kept your old Peugeot for you.

376
01:53:50,416 --> 01:53:52,583
Really? You should have sold the jalopy.

377
01:53:52,666 --> 01:53:55,458
No, you used to love driving it.

378
01:53:56,625 --> 01:53:58,750
Thanks for keeping my car.

379
01:54:21,250 --> 01:54:23,333
I don't want you to make fun of me.

380
01:54:43,291 --> 01:54:44,708
What are you doing here, Moremi?

381
01:54:45,750 --> 01:54:47,125
I am looking for someone.

382
01:54:49,041 --> 01:54:50,333
Moremi, you know...

383
01:54:53,208 --> 01:54:57,708
I have followed reports
of your hearing online.

384
01:55:00,291 --> 01:55:04,958
For the record,
I believe Lucien is innocent

385
01:55:05,041 --> 01:55:09,125
of the allegations you made against him.

386
01:55:11,041 --> 01:55:15,791
So, you think I'm deliberately trying
to ruin his career?

387
01:55:18,458 --> 01:55:20,041
I think you may be...

388
01:55:22,208 --> 01:55:27,125
a student who cannot accept the fact
that your best just wasn't good enough.

389
01:55:30,375 --> 01:55:32,083
I am trying to locate Mr. Cardosa.

390
01:55:36,541 --> 01:55:37,958
I've never heard of him.

391
01:55:39,000 --> 01:55:42,333
He is a laboratory assistant
in the science faculty.

392
01:55:43,500 --> 01:55:45,958
That's not my area of expertise.

393
01:55:46,458 --> 01:55:51,000
But you have access to university records
and contact details.

394
01:55:51,458 --> 01:55:55,916
Miss, what's this Cardosa got to do
with your problem in Nigeria?

395
01:55:57,125 --> 01:55:58,708
That's what I need to find out.

396
01:56:00,916 --> 01:56:06,125
I am not going to conspire with you
to bring down the career of a good tutor.

397
01:56:08,166 --> 01:56:09,000
You know...

398
01:56:10,583 --> 01:56:12,833
Lucien is a former student of mine.

399
01:56:13,791 --> 01:56:16,750
I've worked alongside him. I know the man.

400
01:56:18,541 --> 01:56:24,583
Lucien would never request sex
in exchange for marks from a student.

401
01:56:25,291 --> 01:56:26,250
Never!

402
01:56:27,166 --> 01:56:28,250
Thanks for your time.

403
01:56:31,208 --> 01:56:35,875
I'll be staying overnight
at the university guest house.

404
01:56:41,958 --> 01:56:45,625
Did Professor N'Dyare ever tell you...

405
01:56:46,458 --> 01:56:49,083
how my close friendship with him started?

406
01:56:52,250 --> 01:56:56,875
I taught him how to drive a car
with a manual gear shift.

407
02:01:57,250 --> 02:01:59,166
I am looking for Mr. Cardosa.

408
02:02:32,791 --> 02:02:34,041
Mr. Cardosa.

409
02:02:57,875 --> 02:02:59,250
Finally, you are here.

410
02:03:00,583 --> 02:03:01,666
Please sit.

411
02:03:10,916 --> 02:03:12,041
He was right.

412
02:03:14,000 --> 02:03:15,291
It's more beautiful here.

413
02:03:19,333 --> 02:03:22,500
No. Not as beautiful as my country.

414
02:03:25,000 --> 02:03:27,041
You're not Senegalese?

415
02:03:30,958 --> 02:03:34,666
Lack of work made me relocate to Senegal
many years ago.

416
02:03:36,833 --> 02:03:37,750
However...

417
02:03:38,833 --> 02:03:40,833
it was always my dream for my daughter

418
02:03:40,916 --> 02:03:43,375
to attend university
in the country of my birth.

419
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:44,833
Cape Verde.

420
02:03:46,875 --> 02:03:48,666
We struggled to get by.

421
02:03:49,833 --> 02:03:53,083
Had plenty of mouths to feed
on my lowly clerk salary.

422
02:03:54,333 --> 02:03:57,791
But Diatta was a shining beacon of light.

423
02:03:57,875 --> 02:03:58,708
Excuse me.

424
02:04:04,041 --> 02:04:05,333
No, no, no. Her.

425
02:04:05,416 --> 02:04:09,625
Lucien was her supervising lecturer.
He saw the potential in her...

426
02:04:10,666 --> 02:04:15,291
mentored her, guided her,
secured her a scholarship.

427
02:04:16,416 --> 02:04:18,791
My family felt indebted to him.

428
02:04:22,666 --> 02:04:25,625
We considered him a blessing
to our family.

429
02:04:26,625 --> 02:04:29,750
We prayed for him, thanked God for him.

430
02:04:30,375 --> 02:04:33,958
But alas, he was a wolf
in sheep's clothing.

431
02:04:35,375 --> 02:04:38,291
She was a poor girl
from an impoverished family...

432
02:04:39,333 --> 02:04:41,875
but her education meant the world to her.

433
02:04:43,375 --> 02:04:46,125
She gave in to him time after time.

434
02:04:46,708 --> 02:04:48,875
It was when she found herself with child

435
02:04:49,458 --> 02:04:51,916
that he displayed
his brutally true colors.

436
02:04:57,333 --> 02:05:01,583
Diatta returned to Senegal a broken woman.

437
02:05:03,625 --> 02:05:08,208
No matter how much I assured her,
she felt she had let us down...

438
02:05:09,666 --> 02:05:12,916
and shamed us.

439
02:05:14,333 --> 02:05:15,583
Three days after...

440
02:05:17,000 --> 02:05:19,750
she gave birth to her baby.

441
02:05:20,791 --> 02:05:25,750
She fed her baby, rocked him to sleep,
put him to bed...

442
02:05:33,291 --> 02:05:34,875
then came to this very spot...

443
02:05:46,833 --> 02:05:49,000
and returned to her Maker.

444
02:05:54,458 --> 02:05:55,708
Lucien is a psychopath.

445
02:05:57,041 --> 02:06:02,208
Maybe growing up with an uncaring father
made him turn that way.

446
02:06:03,000 --> 02:06:03,875
Who knows?

447
02:06:05,583 --> 02:06:09,833
He's just evil, manipulative, cunning.

448
02:06:23,541 --> 02:06:26,458
This is just impossible.
I can't drive this car.

449
02:06:31,416 --> 02:06:33,000
Very manipulative indeed.

450
02:06:37,625 --> 02:06:40,583
Lucien visits his son sometimes...

451
02:06:42,125 --> 02:06:45,166
but for the most part,
he just sends money for his upkeep...

452
02:06:47,041 --> 02:06:50,000
and secured me a job at the university.

453
02:06:52,875 --> 02:06:55,541
Samba is his son, right?

454
02:06:56,875 --> 02:06:57,833
We were bribed...

455
02:06:59,166 --> 02:07:01,583
to keep our silence

456
02:07:02,208 --> 02:07:04,416
to save his job and his family.

457
02:07:06,333 --> 02:07:11,208
I took the blood money
to feed the rest of my family.

458
02:07:13,333 --> 02:07:14,833
I've regretted it ever since.

459
02:08:00,291 --> 02:08:01,708
Thanks for your time.

460
02:08:03,750 --> 02:08:04,583
Goodbye.

461
02:10:44,291 --> 02:10:45,416
Mr. Cardosa...

462
02:10:51,083 --> 02:10:53,875
I am Mr. Vicente Cardosa.

463
02:10:56,666 --> 02:10:59,541
I work as a laboratory assistant

464
02:10:59,625 --> 02:11:04,000
at the university in Dakar, Senegal,

465
02:11:04,083 --> 02:11:05,333
Cheikh Anta Diop.

466
02:11:07,083 --> 02:11:11,916
I am here
to give testimony at this hearing

467
02:11:13,166 --> 02:11:15,291
because I have been an acquaintance

468
02:11:15,375 --> 02:11:19,958
of Professor Lucien N'Dyare
for many years.

469
02:11:44,916 --> 02:11:49,083
I only wish I acted faster
like this young warrior here.

470
02:11:49,875 --> 02:11:50,958
Thank you so much.

471
02:11:51,875 --> 02:11:54,791
Continue fighting the good fight.

472
02:11:55,291 --> 02:11:56,791
You can make a difference.

473
02:11:59,166 --> 02:12:00,208
Safe trip.

474
02:15:59,083 --> 02:16:00,916
Why did you do that, sir?

475
02:16:01,833 --> 02:16:04,250
As I said in class,
your work is below par.

476
02:16:04,875 --> 02:16:10,458
The other night, in your house,
you called my work "exemplary."

477
02:16:12,833 --> 02:16:15,041
I've raised the standard since.

478
02:16:15,125 --> 02:16:17,250
If you've raised the standard,

479
02:16:17,750 --> 02:16:20,041
it will be impossible for me

480
02:16:20,125 --> 02:16:24,625
to recover that kind of ground
in time to graduate.

481
02:16:26,125 --> 02:16:30,041
I'll have to extend my course
for an extra semester.

482
02:16:30,125 --> 02:16:32,708
And how is that my problem?

483
02:16:34,375 --> 02:16:37,208
This is all because
I turned you down the other night.

484
02:16:38,833 --> 02:16:40,750
Don't flatter yourself.

485
02:16:40,833 --> 02:16:43,750
You tried to force yourself on me.

486
02:16:46,375 --> 02:16:48,541
It is your word against mine.

487
02:16:49,500 --> 02:16:53,375
And now you intend to fail me.

488
02:16:53,458 --> 02:16:56,250
No. You failed yourself.

489
02:16:57,166 --> 02:17:01,916
But worry not. I believe in you.

490
02:17:02,500 --> 02:17:08,125
So, I'll retain you next semester, too.

491
02:17:09,500 --> 02:17:10,750
I will break you.

492
02:17:18,208 --> 02:17:19,458
It's not over yet!
