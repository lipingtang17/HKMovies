12
00:00:15,530 --> 00:00:16,970
'17 years.

13
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:21,080
'That's how long this man has inflicted untold pain and fear

14
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:23,850
'on the most vulnerable members of our community.'

15
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:32,220
He thinks he owns those streets.

16
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:34,900
Like he owns the homes he breaks into.

17
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:38,180
Go out and show him you do.

20
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:43,680
'What we've got here is all the available cameras

21
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,460
'on the edge of your plot.'

22
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:47,280
He was out last night.'

23
00:00:47,290 --> 00:00:48,540
'Three burglaries.'

24
00:00:49,450 --> 00:00:51,520
Yeah, he's got to be in a car as well.

25
00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:54,330
My money's on Morton Way, straight down.

27
00:00:55,570 --> 00:00:57,460
And that's the only vehicle to go down Morton Way

28
00:00:57,460 --> 00:00:58,320
in our time frame.

29
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,640
That looks like a small people carrier to me.

30
00:01:00,650 --> 00:01:03,370
Yeah, maybe a Zafira.

31
00:01:05,210 --> 00:01:07,500
'Coming so close is disappointing.

32
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:09,560
'I'm certain we'll get a second chance,

33
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:12,370
'but only if we stay sharp and focused.'

34
00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:15,730
Operator, which service do you require?

35
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:18,600
Police... He's breaking in!

36
00:01:18,610 --> 00:01:20,200
I'm sorry, did you say police?

37
00:01:20,210 --> 00:01:24,140
- He's in my house! - 'Is there somewhere you can hide, Sheila?'

38
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:28,200
- Sheila? What's happening? - The police are coming!

39
00:01:28,210 --> 00:01:29,160
The police are coming!

40
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:30,700
The police are coming!

41
00:01:33,970 --> 00:01:34,730
There he is!

42
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:40,050
We're monitoring a CAD from LX,

43
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:41,640
a foot chase following a break in

45
00:01:41,650 --> 00:01:43,590
at the home of an elderly woman.

46
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,880
MP from Lima Oscar Three One, active.

47
00:01:45,890 --> 00:01:49,050
Pc 1-2-6-3, chasing suspect on foot.

48
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,220
- Who is this bloke? - He's just a man, Colin.

49
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:06,010
A sad, sorry, messed-up excuse for a man.

50
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:31,000
All right, settle down. Settle down.

51
00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:33,220
Thank you. The guv'nor wants a word.

52
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:39,300
Two weeks after coming so close, I suspect,

53
00:02:39,850 --> 00:02:42,360
oh, sod that, I know, cos I've heard you,

55
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:44,360
some of you reckon he's gone to ground

56
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:48,890
and this is just a big, expensive waste of time.

57
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:55,040
OK, the near-miss might've spooked him into packing up,

58
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:56,580
I concede that.

59
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:58,320
But I take a different view.

60
00:02:58,330 --> 00:03:01,760
I think it'll drive him back into operating in the one place

61
00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:03,940
we know he feels safe.

62
00:03:04,010 --> 00:03:07,040
Our key lead remains the grey Zafira

63
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:08,800
and I know you all know that

64
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,420
but take another look at these different angles.

65
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,800
Imprint them on your brain,

66
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:16,730
so that at a glance, or from a distance,

67
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:18,220
you can clock it.

68
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,700
Thank you very much.

69
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:28,800
- 34. - Cheers, Nath.

70
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:29,940
- There you go. - Thanks, Nath.

71
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:33,860
- Bring it back in one piece... - Are you all right, guv?

72
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:36,120
Well, you've seen it at Central 3000,

73
00:03:36,130 --> 00:03:37,940
after midnight nothing happens.

74
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,880
Foxes and a few inquisitive cats,

75
00:03:39,890 --> 00:03:41,240
that's the extent of the action.

76
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:44,000
I am genuinely worried they're gonna start nodding off.

77
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:46,160
- No way, boss. - Or they get so used to nothing happening

78
00:03:46,170 --> 00:03:47,560
they don't clock it when it does.

79
00:03:47,570 --> 00:03:50,610
- Well, I just can't see that. - Why not?

80
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:53,220
Very first night, he drove right through the plot.

81
00:03:53,570 --> 00:03:54,960
We didn't know he drove a Zafira then.

82
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:57,120
How many vehicles went through that night? Five?

83
00:03:57,130 --> 00:03:58,520
They could've at least got a reg!

84
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:00,220
With respect, Sir, that's harsh.

85
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:02,960
Clocking the number plate from an OP

86
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:06,300
- and in the dark isn't exactly easy. - Yeah, you're right, Neville.

87
00:04:06,570 --> 00:04:09,580
I just want to get him before they pull the plug on us.

88
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:12,100
- You think that's imminent? - I don't know.

89
00:04:13,010 --> 00:04:13,640
Come on.

90
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:16,340
Central 3000 will manage for one night without us.

91
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:25,810
'OP3 in position.'

92
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,020
'OP44 in position.'

93
00:04:29,890 --> 00:04:31,610
'OP32 in position.'

94
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:36,900
'OP27 in position.'

95
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,360
We weren't expecting such august company, Sir.

96
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:48,170
Oh, well, we don't want any fuss, just want to see how it's done.

97
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:49,580
- This way. - Thank you.

98
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:54,960
Actually, we're down an OP tonight

99
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,810
- it's good to have you. - Evening.

100
00:04:57,650 --> 00:04:59,800
We'll bring you a cuppa for when the curtain goes up.

101
00:04:59,810 --> 00:05:01,220
Much appreciated.

102
00:05:02,810 --> 00:05:04,460
If you can handle things here,

103
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:06,930
we'll be in a scout hut down the next street.

104
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:19,900
Don't worry, we're not sleeping on the job.

105
00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:22,980
After midnight it gets colder than a witch's tit in here.

106
00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:26,900
'OP17 in...'

107
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:29,730
- 'OP20 in position.' - Received.

109
00:05:58,330 --> 00:05:59,540
Do you know U2?

110
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:04,020
- What, the band? - Yeah.

111
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:06,580
Yeah, course I do. How old d'you think I am?

112
00:06:08,890 --> 00:06:10,900
I was massively into them as a kid.

113
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:15,220
I saw them at Wembley on The Joshua Tree tour.

114
00:06:15,450 --> 00:06:19,490
That's a good album. I got it on vinyl somewhere.

115
00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:21,840
Right, so, you know the song, Bullet The Blue Sky?

116
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:27,460
- Yeah. - Well, I had this t-shirt with the lyrics printed on it.

117
00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:29,610
You know, "I can see those fighter planes,"

118
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,860
over a picture of a woman screaming.

119
00:06:32,690 --> 00:06:35,100
I was dead pleased with it.

120
00:06:35,890 --> 00:06:37,880
You know, it was serious, political.

121
00:06:37,890 --> 00:06:40,400
Yeah. Not "Frankie says relax".

122
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,780
Right. Not "Choose life".

123
00:06:44,450 --> 00:06:46,580
But whenever I wore it my mum would go,

124
00:06:47,130 --> 00:06:49,490
"Can you see those fighter planes yet, Nev?"

125
00:06:51,690 --> 00:06:53,370
That's mums for you, you know.

126
00:06:58,330 --> 00:06:59,900
What made you think of that?

127
00:07:03,810 --> 00:07:04,660
Dunno.

128
00:07:06,130 --> 00:07:06,810
Just...

129
00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:12,170
I never did see any fighter planes, so maybe...

130
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:15,700
You got that feeling now, have you?

131
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:21,300
Yeah. Yeah, I do, guv.

132
00:07:21,890 --> 00:07:22,660
I mean...

133
00:07:24,810 --> 00:07:29,900
..if this doesn't work, then... what then?

134
00:07:34,130 --> 00:07:35,460
I tell you what.

135
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:40,260
When he does show up, we've got him.

136
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:43,160
He sets one foot on the plot

137
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:45,100
and he'll stick out like a fucking...

138
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,800
All units, all units, from OP6, be aware.

139
00:07:52,810 --> 00:07:56,440
We have a male on foot, Lavinia Gardens towards Morton Avenue.

140
00:07:56,450 --> 00:07:59,490
Dark hoody worn up, no better description, stand by.

141
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:05,660
He's entering the driveway of number six Lavinia Gardens.

142
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:11,730
OP4. OP4. Did you receive?

143
00:08:12,690 --> 00:08:14,020
'OP4. Received.'

144
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:19,100
Stand by, stand by. He's down the side of a house.

145
00:08:20,170 --> 00:08:22,820
'Mobiles standing by and ready to deploy.'

146
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:25,460
We could be watching him work.

147
00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:28,980
Negative, I repeat, negative, all units are to stand by.

148
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:31,300
Shit. What's that, a torch?

149
00:08:32,890 --> 00:08:35,380
- Should we make a move, guv? - No.

150
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:38,260
No, if we blow our cover, then we've blown the op.

151
00:08:38,850 --> 00:08:40,540
Just wait till we're sure it's him.

152
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:01,000
Stand down, stand down,

153
00:09:01,010 --> 00:09:03,040
it's a young white male going home to bed.

154
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:05,780
- 'Lucky bastard.' - OP6 out.

155
00:09:06,130 --> 00:09:07,860
'Mobiles standing down.'

156
00:09:25,850 --> 00:09:26,740
You ok?

157
00:09:28,130 --> 00:09:30,420
I'm stiff as a board!

158
00:09:30,890 --> 00:09:33,260
I don't know how they do it night after night.

159
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,980
They sleep in the day, for one.

160
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,380
Can't you go in later?

161
00:09:40,450 --> 00:09:42,440
I've got a Health and Safety briefing.

162
00:09:42,450 --> 00:09:45,000
I missed the last two and it's been suggested from above

163
00:09:45,010 --> 00:09:46,480
that I might want to start taking an interest.

164
00:09:46,490 --> 00:09:50,160
- Or what? - I'm not giving them any excuse to take my toys away.

165
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,120
Well, you get killed on the M25,

166
00:09:52,130 --> 00:09:54,660
they'll be the ones who need Health and Safety.

167
00:09:56,090 --> 00:09:58,520
You know, delegation's a hallmark of strong,

168
00:09:58,520 --> 00:09:59,930
- not weak, leadership. - Louise..

169
00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:01,760
You're running yourself into the ground.

170
00:10:01,770 --> 00:10:03,380
Cos Nathan's away.

171
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:06,080
It's possible to care about your job

172
00:10:06,090 --> 00:10:09,050
and find... I don't know, balance.

173
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:13,520
- Not for me. - How hard have you looked?

174
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:16,120
That's the way I am, in for a penny, in for a pound.

175
00:10:16,130 --> 00:10:19,690
I envy people who can leave their work at work.

176
00:10:19,890 --> 00:10:21,260
No, you don't.

177
00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:22,810
You're gonna be late.

178
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,140
Yes, I am.

179
00:10:34,090 --> 00:10:36,380
It's watching you these last weeks...

180
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:43,900
I know it's been frustrating, nerve-wracking, exhausting...

181
00:10:44,450 --> 00:10:46,420
I'm just not sure...

182
00:10:48,010 --> 00:10:53,260
I'm just not sure... it's just about catching this man.

183
00:10:53,450 --> 00:10:54,500
What d'you mean?

184
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,720
I think you're going at it this hard

185
00:10:58,730 --> 00:11:00,540
because you know it's the last time...

186
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:07,210
..and you're dreading that more than anything.

187
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:09,840
I mean, just look at you.

188
00:11:09,850 --> 00:11:11,520
You're out all night in the cold

189
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:14,210
and straight back in this morning.

190
00:11:15,730 --> 00:11:18,280
You don't want to miss a thing, or waste time sleeping,

191
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:22,620
cos you know how big a hole that's gonna leave.

192
00:11:23,970 --> 00:11:28,740
And I don't blame you. How could I?

193
00:11:29,010 --> 00:11:31,540
You're in your element, it's just who you are.

194
00:11:32,090 --> 00:11:35,720
I just hope when it's over, when you're done...

195
00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:40,540
that what we have is enough. That I'm enough.

196
00:11:45,730 --> 00:11:49,740
And you can make your peace with pub quizzes and garden centres.

197
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,760
Yes to the former, no to the latter.

198
00:11:51,770 --> 00:11:52,920
Oh, go on, make a joke of it.

199
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:55,420
- Unless under duress or in disguise. - Colin.

200
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:00,980
You're right.

201
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:03,380
I am scared about what's next.

202
00:12:03,770 --> 00:12:07,140
The job's all I know and, to be honest,

203
00:12:07,610 --> 00:12:09,930
I can't even imagine what it's gonna be like.

204
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:19,780
- Right, I'd better go. - We'll be all right, though?

205
00:12:22,330 --> 00:12:23,620
I hope so.

206
00:12:36,010 --> 00:12:37,320
We are all set.

207
00:12:37,330 --> 00:12:39,840
Observation points will be radioing in any minute.

208
00:12:39,850 --> 00:12:40,860
Cheers, Michelle.

210
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:52,720
All right? They let us go a day early.

211
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:55,400
Oh, yeah? What's that, time off for good behaviour?

212
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,660
Something like that, yeah.

213
00:12:57,090 --> 00:12:59,480
- How was it? - Yeah, fine.

214
00:12:59,490 --> 00:13:02,280
But, erm, you've had a bit of a time of it,

215
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:05,020
so I'm relieving you as of now.

216
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,800
Oh, no, I appreciate the thought but I'm here now...

217
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:10,720
I second that. Do us all a favour and bugger off.

218
00:13:10,730 --> 00:13:12,690
- Do you want a coffee? - Yeah, please.

219
00:13:12,730 --> 00:13:14,380
Take tomorrow off, too.

220
00:13:15,090 --> 00:13:16,570
It's the weekend, guv.

221
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:25,080
Ok. All right. Yeah. OK, cheers.

222
00:13:25,090 --> 00:13:26,280
Anything I should know?

223
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:28,720
Er, well, in the increasingly unlikely event

224
00:13:28,730 --> 00:13:30,720
that we should actually need to stop someone...

225
00:13:30,730 --> 00:13:33,360
Colin Sutton, disillusioned? I don't believe it.

226
00:13:33,370 --> 00:13:35,000
It is essential that we do it

227
00:13:35,010 --> 00:13:37,500
as far away from the plot as possible.

228
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:38,200
Ok...?

229
00:13:38,210 --> 00:13:39,480
So that if they are ruled out they

230
00:13:39,490 --> 00:13:41,260
won't know where they were stopped.

231
00:13:41,730 --> 00:13:44,980
Less chance of the op and its location leaking?

232
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:48,000
Nice to have you back, Nathan.

233
00:13:48,010 --> 00:13:50,040
Thank you. Thank you.

234
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:50,810
Good night

235
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:18,100
Nine o'clock.

236
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:23,450
That's a Zafira, right? Behind that red Citroen.

237
00:14:26,970 --> 00:14:28,860
Yeah, that's a Zafira.

238
00:14:29,010 --> 00:14:31,660
Facelifted model and the colour's right, too.

239
00:14:32,010 --> 00:14:33,200
And it wasn't parked there

240
00:14:33,210 --> 00:14:35,620
or any of the surrounding streets in the last fortnight.

241
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:39,300
Call it in.

242
00:14:40,650 --> 00:14:42,680
Control, Control from OP6,

243
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:44,300
can I give a circulation?

244
00:14:46,450 --> 00:14:47,570
'Go ahead, Six.'

245
00:14:48,490 --> 00:14:50,080
We have a grey Zafira

246
00:14:50,090 --> 00:14:53,560
parked opposite our OP on Lavinia Gardens, facing east.

247
00:14:53,570 --> 00:14:54,800
We haven't seen it before.

248
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:57,400
It's of the right colour and age to be of interest,

249
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:59,240
so can all units please bear this in mind

250
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:01,240
in case we put it up as moving later?

251
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:04,480
All received, OP6. All units, all units, please be aware

252
00:15:04,490 --> 00:15:06,120
there is a grey Vauxhall Zafira

253
00:15:06,130 --> 00:15:09,020
stationary on Lavinia Gardens, facing east.

254
00:15:09,090 --> 00:15:10,800
It has not been seen previously

255
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:13,520
and OP6 will update if there is any movement.

256
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:14,930
Control out.

257
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:18,020
Not even a partial on the reg?

258
00:15:18,490 --> 00:15:20,500
'Sorry, totally blocked from view.'

259
00:15:21,370 --> 00:15:24,300
Someone could stretch their legs, get it that way?

260
00:15:26,010 --> 00:15:28,380
No. Can't risk it. Stay in position.

261
00:15:28,730 --> 00:15:29,570
Understood.

262
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:39,720
- Hello, love. - Hello.

263
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:42,660
- Thought I'd surprise you. - Mission accomplished?

264
00:15:42,730 --> 00:15:45,760
Nathan finished his course a day early. He insisted.

265
00:15:45,770 --> 00:15:48,000
Hope you didn't put up too much of a fight?

266
00:15:48,010 --> 00:15:50,040
Well, security had to see me out of the building,

267
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:51,320
but apart from that...

268
00:15:51,330 --> 00:15:54,140
And the Brazil game wasn't any kind of incentive?

269
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:56,320
Hadn't even crossed my mind, actually.

270
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:58,860
- Uh-huh - But, er, if you're game, I am.

271
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:01,220
Oh, go on, then.

272
00:16:03,090 --> 00:16:04,860
Tell Nathan thank you.

273
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:18,690
Hang on. Got a pedestrian heading east on Lavinia Gardens.

274
00:16:19,610 --> 00:16:21,260
Make that two pedestrians.

275
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,420
Looks like they're heading for the Zafira.

276
00:16:30,850 --> 00:16:34,020
No, they've moved past it to an adjacent vehicle.

277
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:42,020
Ok.

278
00:16:46,210 --> 00:16:48,160
Central 3000 from OP6.

279
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:49,480
We've got a sight of the Zafira's plates.

280
00:16:49,490 --> 00:16:51,920
Can we get a PNC vehicle check, please?

281
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:54,860
OP6, let me have your warrant number and location.

282
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:57,560
3-7-6-4-2-2.

283
00:16:57,570 --> 00:16:59,440
And Lavinia Gardens, over.

284
00:16:59,450 --> 00:17:01,740
Received OP6, go ahead with the index.

285
00:17:02,210 --> 00:17:06,240
Foxtrot Romeo Zero Six Oscar Bravo Hotel.

286
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,540
Should be a grey Vauxhall Zafira.

287
00:17:09,010 --> 00:17:10,960
OP6 from 3000.

288
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:13,480
Indeed it is a grey Vauxhall Zafira,

289
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:15,960
no trace lost or stolen, no reports.

290
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:18,360
Keeper since new shown as a Jennifer Grant,

291
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:20,160
leased under the Motability Scheme.

292
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,880
'All received, 3000. OP6 out.'

293
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:23,160
Motability Scheme?

294
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:26,120
Motability Operations Ltd to give them their full title -

295
00:17:26,130 --> 00:17:27,960
based on Southwark Bridge Road.

296
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:29,570
Doesn't sound like our man.

297
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:31,800
'Let's try and look on the bright side.

298
00:17:31,810 --> 00:17:34,520
'It was only 1-0 and England sort of finished strongly.'

299
00:17:34,530 --> 00:17:36,020
That's what we all say.

300
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:40,940
- It was a valiant effort. - They were shocking.

301
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:42,960
One, it's a friendly,

302
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,600
two, you slept through most of it...

303
00:17:44,610 --> 00:17:46,420
God help us in the World Cup.

304
00:17:47,330 --> 00:17:50,850
Three, it's Brazil, so 1-0 is OK, it's respectable.

305
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:53,180
Lucky it wasn't 5-0.

306
00:17:54,570 --> 00:17:57,420
- Where is the next World Cup? - South Africa.

307
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:00,880
- Why don't we go? - Seriously?

308
00:18:00,890 --> 00:18:02,780
Keep us out of the garden centres.

309
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,360
Got what looks like a Black male

310
00:18:22,370 --> 00:18:24,540
coming up from Lavinia Gardens in a hurry.

311
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:39,160
He's getting in the Zafira.

312
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:41,700
I repeat, he's getting in the Zafira!

313
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:44,320
Adam, you're our closest vehicle. Can you follow?

314
00:18:44,330 --> 00:18:46,090
Received. Moving out.

315
00:18:49,130 --> 00:18:53,090
He's driving away, heading north on Morton Avenue.

316
00:18:53,290 --> 00:18:56,090
'Understood. Entering Lavinia Gardens now.'

317
00:18:58,810 --> 00:19:00,400
Make sure aerial support get this,

319
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:03,160
the Zafira is mobile and heading north on Morton Avenue.

320
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:05,370
You're confident he came from Lavinia Gardens?

321
00:19:05,370 --> 00:19:06,280
'Very confident.'

322
00:19:06,290 --> 00:19:08,120
Someone needs to check the street for a break-in.

323
00:19:08,130 --> 00:19:09,980
Could be a victim needs our help.

324
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:13,550
OP20, we're at the top end of Lavinia Gardens -

325
00:19:13,550 --> 00:19:14,850
consider it done.

326
00:19:15,090 --> 00:19:16,880
Thanks, OP20, make sure you notify

327
00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:18,980
the adjacent OP so they can cover.

328
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:27,740
I have the eye. Suspect vehicle moving north on Morton Way.

329
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:40,800
He's moving north on Ambleside Avenue on the elevated section.

330
00:19:40,810 --> 00:19:44,260
Adam, you've got the 4-2 coming past you for a closer look.

331
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:50,400
'4-2 to Control. I have the target in sight.

332
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,740
'Hold back in this position.

333
00:19:52,570 --> 00:19:54,780
- 'Heading past for a look now.' - 'Copy that.'

334
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:04,440
'Confirmed. Driver is an IC three male, no passengers.'

335
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:05,660
Thanks, copy that.

336
00:20:12,810 --> 00:20:14,220
'When shall we pull him, Sir?'

337
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:16,120
'The boss was very clear,

338
00:20:16,130 --> 00:20:19,050
'we pick him up as far from the plot as possible.'

339
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:21,940
- Can you be more specific? - Yes, two miles.

341
00:20:22,090 --> 00:20:24,240
We're taking 4-2 and giving you advanced backup.

343
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:25,500
Should be with you now.

344
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:31,540
'I'll leave it to you, then. 4-2 out.'

345
00:20:34,810 --> 00:20:36,980
Cath. The light.

346
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,400
Police!

347
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:50,460
What the fucking going? Come on. That's got to be two miles now.

348
00:20:54,130 --> 00:20:57,370
Oh, shit. He's turned right. Repeat, he's turned right.

349
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:01,010
I'm still on him.

350
00:21:01,010 --> 00:21:03,200
'Yeah, I'll scoot back round and catch you up.'

351
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:06,400
He's turned into a residential area. What's the plan now, Sir?

352
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:07,800
Plan hasn't changed.

353
00:21:07,810 --> 00:21:10,000
Please wait, repeat wait,

354
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,180
until he's two miles off the plot.

355
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:15,420
You have 9-9 tracking you as a fallback.

356
00:21:16,770 --> 00:21:18,540
'3000 from 9-9,

357
00:21:18,730 --> 00:21:21,140
'can confirm we have target vehicle in sight.'

358
00:21:35,010 --> 00:21:37,900
Hello? Police, can you hear me?

359
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:39,300
Do you have an update, Adam?

360
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:44,490
I've turned onto Witham Street. Repeat, east on Witham Street.

361
00:21:44,490 --> 00:21:46,010
'I'm back behind you.

362
00:21:46,010 --> 00:21:47,580
'I know that road, it's all residential.'

363
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:50,860
You hear that, Sir? Witham Street's all residential.

364
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:54,000
Gonna be tough to follow him without showing up.

365
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:57,530
By the looks of things he could be off to hit a new house,

366
00:21:57,530 --> 00:21:58,770
I say we pull him now.

367
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:01,620
- I hear you, Adam. - Cathy just called.

368
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:04,580
You were right, he broke into a bungalow on Lavinia Gardens.

369
00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:06,450
- Anyone hurt? - Property was unoccupied.

370
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:13,060
'Sir?'

371
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:15,940
Go, go, go, take him!

372
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:18,580
Received. Gonna move in. Are we covered at the rear?

373
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:20,300
'Confirmed. We're covered.'

374
00:22:55,250 --> 00:22:57,210
- Everything all right? - DC Adam Spier.

375
00:22:57,210 --> 00:23:00,450
- Would you mind telling me your name, sir? - Not the exhaust, is it?

376
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:02,180
Your name, please.

377
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:05,490
Kelvin. Kelvin Grant.

378
00:23:05,490 --> 00:23:08,760
OK, can you just turn the engine off and hand me the key?

379
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:13,940
You got some ID on you, Kelvin?

380
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:16,300
No, sorry.

381
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:19,940
Well, it looks like you've got a couple of bank cards down there.

382
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:21,480
They'll do.

383
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:33,060
- Well, these say Delroy... Grant. - Sure.

384
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:37,120
My name's Delroy Grant, but everyone calls me Kelvin.

385
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:39,420
Well, what should I call you?

386
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:43,160
Delroy.

387
00:23:44,770 --> 00:23:47,250
OK, Delroy, well, if you can stay where you are for me,

388
00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:48,970
my colleague's gonna take a look in your boot.

389
00:23:48,970 --> 00:23:51,620
- Is it open? - Yeah, it's open.

390
00:23:54,010 --> 00:23:56,700
- What d'you do for work, Delroy? - I'm a carer.

391
00:23:58,660 --> 00:24:00,380
Oh, right. OK.

392
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:02,790
And what are you doing out this late?

393
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:07,060
I was waiting outside the Co-op to buy some puff,

394
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:09,480
but the guy never showed.

395
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:11,140
Adam.

396
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:17,100
Would you like to step out of the vehicle, please, Delroy?

397
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:22,250
Delroy Grant, I am arresting you

398
00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:26,060
on suspicion of rape, burglary and indecent assault.

399
00:24:26,060 --> 00:24:28,300
You do not have to say anything, but it may harm your defence

400
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:30,380
if you do not mention when questioned

401
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:32,620
something which you later rely on in court.

402
00:24:51,770 --> 00:24:52,580
Colin Sutton.

403
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:55,180
'Colin, it's Nathan. Looks like we've got him.'

404
00:24:55,180 --> 00:24:57,820
Fuck. You're joking?

405
00:24:58,490 --> 00:25:00,380
Do you really think I'd joke about something like that

406
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:01,730
at three in the morning?

407
00:25:01,730 --> 00:25:04,340
'No, I suppose not. Are you sure it's him?'

408
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:06,250
Well, put it this way,

409
00:25:06,250 --> 00:25:09,620
we recovered his grey top with black stripes

410
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:12,100
from his silver-grey facelifted Zafira.

411
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:14,450
- The Colbridge Road footage? - 'Perfect match,

412
00:25:14,450 --> 00:25:17,100
'plus he had a crowbar and a screwdriver in the boot.

413
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:17,860
'It's early days,

414
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:21,580
'but I'd say the latter probably made all those pry marks.'

415
00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:23,970
Bloody hell! What's his name?

416
00:25:24,250 --> 00:25:26,970
Delroy Easton Grant.

417
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:31,140
From a continuity of command angle,

418
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:34,060
it probably makes sense for me to carry it on till morning...

419
00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:37,450
Good to see that SIO course wasn't wasted.

420
00:25:37,450 --> 00:25:40,730
'Yeah, didn't think I'd put it to use quite so soon.'

421
00:25:40,730 --> 00:25:43,490
This is great work, Nathan, it's great work.

422
00:25:43,490 --> 00:25:45,900
Please pass that onto the others for me, will you?

423
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:47,580
Yeah. Will do.

424
00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:51,220
- I'll see you at eight. - 'Yeah. See you then.'

425
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:05,860
Who are you kidding?

426
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:09,290
We got him.

427
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:15,770
I'll put the kettle on.

428
00:26:44,290 --> 00:26:45,890
- 'Simon Morgan.' - It's Colin Sutton.

429
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:47,620
I'm sorry to call you so early,

430
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:49,810
but I wanted you to hear it from me,

431
00:26:49,810 --> 00:26:51,140
it looks like we've got him.

432
00:26:53,740 --> 00:26:54,620
Simon?

433
00:26:54,740 --> 00:26:57,610
'Yeah, I'm still here. Fucking hell.'

434
00:26:57,620 --> 00:26:59,010
Yeah, that's what I said.

435
00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:01,730
One of our OPs on Lavinia Gardens saw...

436
00:27:01,730 --> 00:27:02,490
'I'm on my way in.'

437
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:05,580
OK, I'll fill you in when you get here.

438
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:21,970
This is the boss, Mr Sutton.

439
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:26,290
Hello, sir.

440
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:29,770
I'm so pleased to meet you.

441
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:34,900
So what are you, batting or bowling?

442
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:39,650
You're not into cricket, are you, sir?

443
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:42,410
- Yeah. - But you still don't play?

444
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:45,170
I do, as a matter of fact, yeah, occasionally. You?

445
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:47,530
Yes, yes, of course I do. Bat and bowl.

446
00:27:47,530 --> 00:27:50,210
Oh, good for you. My knees won't let me bowl,

447
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:53,220
but I can still swing a bat around as well as I ever could.

448
00:27:54,010 --> 00:27:54,940
Well, tell me, sir,

449
00:27:55,530 --> 00:27:58,140
what do you think of England's chances in South Africa?

450
00:27:59,140 --> 00:28:01,570
I think we could do with one more fast bowler

451
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:03,330
but, er, I think we've got a great chance.

452
00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:05,220
Yeah, man, that's what I've been saying!

453
00:28:11,010 --> 00:28:12,570
Just so you're aware, sir,

454
00:28:12,580 --> 00:28:15,810
my wife suffers from MS and I'm her primary carer.

455
00:28:15,810 --> 00:28:17,860
Obviously, this'll come as a shock to her.

456
00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:20,660
Yeah, I imagine it will.

457
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:24,970
Well, I just want to make sure she's properly taken care of.

458
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:28,700
- I'll be worried otherwise. - Sorry to interrupt.

459
00:28:28,770 --> 00:28:32,060
Mr Grant, could I have your signature for the DNA sample?

460
00:28:43,650 --> 00:28:45,100
Prints now, please.

461
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:49,140
This way.

462
00:28:58,460 --> 00:29:02,450
- Still doing 'em old school? - Oh, yeah. Can't beat a wet set.

463
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:04,010
I need your right hand, please.

464
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:33,970
Don't know why you're bothering,

465
00:29:35,290 --> 00:29:37,100
you know I always wore gloves.

466
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:49,770
That was an interesting comment you made just now

467
00:29:49,770 --> 00:29:51,460
about always wearing gloves.

468
00:29:51,980 --> 00:29:53,300
Er, could we get a signature off you,

469
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:54,850
just to confirm you made it?

470
00:30:00,530 --> 00:30:01,560
Have you had any contact

471
00:30:01,570 --> 00:30:04,810
with a vulnerable or an elderly person tonight, Delroy?

472
00:30:07,650 --> 00:30:10,000
There's no-one out there with a broken hip

473
00:30:10,010 --> 00:30:11,440
who can't get to the phone?

474
00:30:12,250 --> 00:30:14,370
No-one in need of help and attention?

475
00:30:16,330 --> 00:30:19,010
I haven't visited anyone tonight.

476
00:30:22,610 --> 00:30:23,800
Very important that you ask

477
00:30:23,810 --> 00:30:27,200
if there's anything you don't understand, Delroy. OK?

478
00:30:28,370 --> 00:30:32,640
- Oh, dear, oh, dear, oh, dear. - What is it, Delroy?

479
00:30:36,290 --> 00:30:38,680
You really want to have a look at my son.

480
00:30:39,650 --> 00:30:40,680
Your son?

481
00:30:40,810 --> 00:30:44,810
This is hard for me... so hard...

482
00:30:46,770 --> 00:30:48,960
..but given the seriousness of the offences,

483
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:51,330
I want to make sure you get the right man.

484
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:56,530
His DNA's gonna be the same as mine, or very similar,

485
00:30:56,680 --> 00:31:00,680
plus we're the same height, and he lives in the area.

486
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:07,440
Why did you wait until now to tell us this, Delroy?

487
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:12,850
I'm still in a state of shock.

488
00:31:14,090 --> 00:31:16,000
- Bullshit. - Yeah, course it's bullshit.

489
00:31:16,010 --> 00:31:18,200
Twins can share DNA, but not fathers and sons.

490
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:20,160
He's right, though, they can be very similar.

491
00:31:20,290 --> 00:31:22,360
- We need to jump on this? - Yeah, we need to make some calls.

492
00:31:22,370 --> 00:31:24,920
Get Patricia to look the son up and we can get a sample.

493
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:27,530
- Yeah. Will do, boss. - And tell her I want to be there.

494
00:31:37,330 --> 00:31:38,330
You didn't hang about.

495
00:31:38,890 --> 00:31:40,760
- We're sure it's him? - Yeah, I think so.

496
00:31:40,770 --> 00:31:43,570
- The DNA will confirm. - Was he in the system?

497
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:47,160
TBC - I came straight here. Congratulations.

498
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:49,280
Your day, your case,

499
00:31:49,290 --> 00:31:52,130
- I just helped it over the finish line. - Thank you.

500
00:31:53,330 --> 00:31:55,280
- I'll go check on the team. - Yeah, I'll join you.

501
00:31:55,290 --> 00:31:58,010
- I just wanna see his face. - Sure, yeah.

502
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:32,730
OK, was he in the system or not?

503
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:36,970
- It's complicated. - He's not kidding.

504
00:32:37,090 --> 00:32:39,240
I had to go and have a lie down when they explained it.

505
00:32:39,250 --> 00:32:42,530
- That's just you, Kenny. - Go on, Nath.

506
00:32:44,490 --> 00:32:48,090
There's a burglary, back in '99 in Bromley.

507
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:50,320
Local police inform the Minstead team,

508
00:32:50,330 --> 00:32:53,090
but they don't think it's Minstead Man.

509
00:32:53,130 --> 00:32:55,210
- Didn't fit the criteria? - No.

510
00:32:55,250 --> 00:32:57,120
So Bromley go ahead and investigate.

511
00:32:57,130 --> 00:32:59,840
Now a neighbour of the victim sees a car

512
00:32:59,850 --> 00:33:01,680
that she thinks looks suspicious

513
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:03,160
and she reports the number.

514
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:06,160
They run a trace and it's registered to a Delroy Grant

515
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:08,160
at an address in Forest Hill.

516
00:33:08,650 --> 00:33:10,370
They put his name in the PNC.

517
00:33:11,090 --> 00:33:13,290
It IDs six people of that name.

518
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:17,490
One in Hackney, had a burglary conviction. DNA on file.

519
00:33:19,650 --> 00:33:22,370
Right. And this sample was compared to our scenes?

520
00:33:23,370 --> 00:33:25,290
They informed us that Hackney Delroy

521
00:33:25,290 --> 00:33:26,370
wasn't Minstead Man.

522
00:33:27,530 --> 00:33:30,520
- Sounds straightforward. - Yeah, except somehow that result

523
00:33:30,530 --> 00:33:33,480
became assigned to Forest Hill Delroy's profile

524
00:33:33,490 --> 00:33:35,960
and a nominal was created on our system.

525
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:37,640
Their mistake became our mistake?

526
00:33:37,650 --> 00:33:40,050
Yeah. And it gets worse.

527
00:33:41,050 --> 00:33:44,080
A DC from our team went to visit Forest Hill Delroy

528
00:33:44,090 --> 00:33:46,730
to check his movements on the night of the burglary.

529
00:33:49,330 --> 00:33:50,330
Yeah, and...?

530
00:33:51,890 --> 00:33:55,010
He was out and it was never followed up.

531
00:33:55,850 --> 00:33:58,290
- And that's the Delroy we just nicked? - Yeah.

532
00:34:00,090 --> 00:34:01,210
Turn to your right.

533
00:34:03,490 --> 00:34:04,640
If his DNA had been taken,

534
00:34:04,650 --> 00:34:07,330
he would have instantly been identified as Minstead Man.

535
00:34:08,890 --> 00:34:09,800
Christ...

536
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:13,530
From that moment on, the name Delroy Grant was ruled out.

537
00:34:14,450 --> 00:34:15,570
Turn to your left.

538
00:34:19,930 --> 00:34:21,520
And he wasn't on the swabbing list?

539
00:34:21,530 --> 00:34:24,320
No, been formally eliminated by DNA.

540
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:27,450
- So you'd never have got him that way anyway? - No.

541
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:30,600
In 2001, the name Delroy Grant cropped up again

542
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:33,880
when someone called the hotline pushing him as a suspect.

543
00:34:33,890 --> 00:34:36,400
It was after one of those Crimewatch appeals.

544
00:34:36,410 --> 00:34:37,680
And the action got binned

545
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:40,490
because HOLMES said he'd been cleared by DNA.

546
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:42,890
Ten years ago.

547
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:45,850
A decade.

548
00:34:48,490 --> 00:34:50,130
How many victims since then?

549
00:35:12,570 --> 00:35:14,090
'Delroy Grant Jr?'

550
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:16,090
Come in.

551
00:35:23,650 --> 00:35:25,600
Does, er, anyone live here with you, Delroy?

552
00:35:25,610 --> 00:35:29,320
My mum and my brother. What's this about?

553
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:32,320
You're not in any trouble. No-one's died, it's nothing like that.

554
00:35:33,010 --> 00:35:36,450
But we do have some difficult news to share with you.

555
00:35:37,530 --> 00:35:38,370
Ok...

556
00:35:39,970 --> 00:35:41,570
Look, can we sit down?

557
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:52,970
Are you familiar with the Night Stalker case, Delroy?

558
00:35:53,890 --> 00:35:56,410
- Yeah, the bloke attacking old ladies? - That's right.

559
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:59,570
Said on the news you arrested someone.

560
00:36:00,010 --> 00:36:02,090
We have, that's correct.

561
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:05,080
I'm very sorry to tell you that

562
00:36:05,090 --> 00:36:08,320
that man is your father, Delroy Easton Grant.

563
00:36:10,450 --> 00:36:11,370
No.

564
00:36:15,530 --> 00:36:17,050
No way. It can't be.

565
00:36:18,970 --> 00:36:19,890
How...

566
00:36:22,050 --> 00:36:23,370
How sure are you?

567
00:36:24,010 --> 00:36:26,480
Well, we don't have absolute confirmation yet,

568
00:36:26,490 --> 00:36:28,970
but we wouldn't be here unless we were very sure.

569
00:36:29,970 --> 00:36:31,570
How often do you see your dad?

570
00:36:32,490 --> 00:36:33,610
Now and then.

571
00:36:35,050 --> 00:36:37,680
For a long time we had nothing to do with him.

572
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:39,050
"We"?

573
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:42,090
Me, Mum, my brother...

574
00:36:42,130 --> 00:36:43,240
Why was that?

575
00:36:43,850 --> 00:36:47,760
Well, he walked out when I was a toddler. Two, I think.

576
00:37:11,890 --> 00:37:12,680
Yeah.

577
00:37:14,450 --> 00:37:16,530
Didn't see him again till I was eight or nine.

578
00:37:20,450 --> 00:37:21,920
Turned up at the school gates one day

579
00:37:21,930 --> 00:37:24,850
and promised to take me and my brother swimming at the weekend.

580
00:37:26,890 --> 00:37:29,840
Mum wasn't keen, but she saw how excited we were

581
00:37:29,850 --> 00:37:31,410
and changed her mind.

582
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:33,490
I was giddy.

583
00:37:33,930 --> 00:37:36,920
Like a... kid on Christmas morning.

584
00:37:36,930 --> 00:37:38,510
Had my bags packed hours before

585
00:37:38,510 --> 00:37:40,160
he was supposed to pick me up.

586
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:45,490
I remember I really wanted to show him my backflip.

587
00:37:47,930 --> 00:37:49,240
Pathetic, really...

588
00:37:50,930 --> 00:37:52,370
But he never turned up?

589
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:59,930
I didn't see him again till I was in my 20s and...

590
00:38:01,410 --> 00:38:02,610
by then I knew.

591
00:38:03,930 --> 00:38:06,530
- Knew...? - What he'd done to Mum.

592
00:38:07,130 --> 00:38:08,960
The violence. The beatings.

593
00:38:08,970 --> 00:38:10,370
What he'd put her through.

594
00:38:17,890 --> 00:38:19,280
Those poor women...

595
00:38:20,610 --> 00:38:23,130
Who got back in touch, you or your dad?

596
00:38:23,530 --> 00:38:24,450
Me.

597
00:38:26,930 --> 00:38:28,050
Me and my brother.

598
00:38:29,490 --> 00:38:31,490
Someone told us that he'd remarried.

599
00:38:31,530 --> 00:38:35,960
That his wife had MS and what an amazing husband he was,

600
00:38:35,970 --> 00:38:37,450
what an amazing carer...

601
00:38:38,050 --> 00:38:40,240
- That must've been difficult to believe? - Yeah.

602
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:44,410
"This I have to see," I thought. So we go round.

603
00:38:45,650 --> 00:38:47,570
"Hello, Dad. Long time, no see."

604
00:38:49,610 --> 00:38:50,640
All true.

605
00:38:52,570 --> 00:38:55,720
His wife was sweet, but she needed a lot of care...

606
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:58,970
and there he was, providing it.

607
00:38:59,970 --> 00:39:02,850
Kind, patient, everything organised.

608
00:39:03,610 --> 00:39:06,370
I didn't begrudge her, how could I? But...

609
00:39:07,130 --> 00:39:08,370
Hard to see.

610
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:15,490
Something else we need to tell you, Delroy.

611
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:18,880
We're giving it no credit whatsoever

612
00:39:18,890 --> 00:39:22,440
but your father has accused you of committing these crimes.

613
00:39:22,450 --> 00:39:23,480
- What...? - Yeah.

614
00:39:23,490 --> 00:39:25,520
As Patricia said, we don't believe it for a minute,

615
00:39:25,530 --> 00:39:28,640
but, er, we will have to eliminate you with a DNA test.

616
00:39:28,650 --> 00:39:30,490
Sorry, hang on, he said...

617
00:39:31,890 --> 00:39:34,850
The rapes and everything? He said it was me?

618
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:39,280
Why would he say that?

619
00:39:39,850 --> 00:39:41,530
Because that's the sort of person he is,

620
00:39:41,930 --> 00:39:44,370
and, from what you're telling us, always was.

621
00:40:06,130 --> 00:40:07,320
- There you go. - Thanks.

622
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:10,330
They didn't have any torn avocado, I got you ham and cheese.

623
00:40:10,610 --> 00:40:11,570
There you go.

624
00:40:14,530 --> 00:40:18,570
My nan's 92 and still dyes her hair... what's left of it.

625
00:40:19,970 --> 00:40:22,640
She said when you get old it's like you lose your identity.

626
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:27,130
People don't see you, they just see an old person -

627
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:31,610
grey hair, fawn coat, bad glasses, a sheep in a flock.

628
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:37,490
That's why this went on so long. Victims were invisible.

629
00:40:37,650 --> 00:40:40,610
Yeah, and the rest of us are in denial.

630
00:40:41,370 --> 00:40:42,760
We all think it won't happen to us.

631
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:43,560
We'll buck the trend.

632
00:40:43,570 --> 00:40:47,050
Bedpans, false teeth,

633
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:50,760
dementia, Zimmer frame. No way, no thanks. Not us, mate.

634
00:40:52,930 --> 00:40:55,200
And the way we feed that lie is to ignore them.

635
00:40:56,650 --> 00:40:58,930
I mean, we notice them, but we don't see them.

636
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:02,560
We don't avert our gaze, but we certainly don't linger

637
00:41:02,570 --> 00:41:05,240
cos they're the future we don't want and can't escape.

638
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:08,200
Yeah. It's like we blame them, innit.

639
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:09,760
Exactly.

640
00:41:11,930 --> 00:41:14,050
And what the fuck does that say about us?

641
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:17,640
You ok?

642
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:21,240
You said when this was over it would hit me.

643
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:27,200
Yeah, I did. Come on.

644
00:41:34,050 --> 00:41:36,560
- Good news? - Just got the DNA back -

645
00:41:36,570 --> 00:41:39,760
effectively 100% match with all our samples.

646
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:40,680
Semen from the rapes,

647
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:43,280
saliva from the cheek of the Harness Street victim,

648
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:46,370
- the orange juice carton at Colbridge Road... - "Effectively"?

649
00:41:46,490 --> 00:41:48,680
Well, they word it like this,

650
00:41:48,850 --> 00:41:51,160
"The DNA taken from Delroy Grant

651
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:56,040
"is 47.5 septillion times more likely to be linked to the DNA

652
00:41:56,050 --> 00:41:59,200
"of Minstead Man than an unrelated person."

653
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:01,610
"Septillion." I like the sound of that.

654
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:04,760
- What about the screwdriver marks? - Definitely his, boss.

655
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:07,320
As they're present at two of the scenes where we got DNA

656
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:08,880
and loads of scenes where we didn't,

657
00:42:08,890 --> 00:42:11,640
it links him to literally dozens of offences.

658
00:42:11,650 --> 00:42:13,320
Has he been confronted with this?

659
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:15,440
No commented as soon as we started rolling.

660
00:42:15,450 --> 00:42:17,240
CPS have given us a slot.

661
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:19,480
I say we charge him with as much as possible,

662
00:42:19,490 --> 00:42:21,410
never mind "He's going down already."

663
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:25,680
Agreed. We get justice for as many victims as we can.

664
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:27,800
Let's throw the fucking book at him.

665
00:42:28,890 --> 00:42:32,490
Do you understand the charges brought against you today?

666
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:35,800
- Yeah, I do. - And how do you plead?

667
00:42:36,570 --> 00:42:37,640
Not guilty.

668
00:42:39,410 --> 00:42:44,920
Mr Grant, you are charged with 22 offences

670
00:42:44,930 --> 00:42:47,160
of the utmost gravity,

671
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:51,920
five of rape, six indecent assaults,

672
00:42:51,930 --> 00:42:54,570
and 11 burglaries.

673
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:57,850
Notwithstanding that you deny them,

674
00:42:58,050 --> 00:43:02,050
there is, in our opinion, a very high likelihood

675
00:43:02,130 --> 00:43:08,680
that, if convicted, you may well receive a long prison sentence.

676
00:43:09,130 --> 00:43:12,370
You are remanded in custody to...

677
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:15,280
Belmarsh, Madam.

678
00:43:15,570 --> 00:43:18,130
To HMP Belmarsh.

679
00:43:37,890 --> 00:43:40,410
Plenty of officers working past retirement age now.

680
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:43,160
Everybody's got to go sometime, though.

681
00:43:44,850 --> 00:43:45,850
Just saying.

682
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:50,400
DI up in Kilburn got his bus pass five years ago.

683
00:43:50,410 --> 00:43:52,200
- Five years? - Yeah.

684
00:43:52,930 --> 00:43:54,850
Closed a double murder the other day.

685
00:43:58,970 --> 00:44:00,760
I can finish up here if you want to get off.

686
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:02,280
No, no. You're all right.

687
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:03,490
- You sure? - Yeah.

688
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:06,760
- Right. - Nathan?

689
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:10,160
Thanks.

690
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:14,720
You let me in when, er, the others weren't so inclined.

691
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:16,930
I appreciate it.

692
00:44:21,850 --> 00:44:23,280
Thank fuck I did, boss.
