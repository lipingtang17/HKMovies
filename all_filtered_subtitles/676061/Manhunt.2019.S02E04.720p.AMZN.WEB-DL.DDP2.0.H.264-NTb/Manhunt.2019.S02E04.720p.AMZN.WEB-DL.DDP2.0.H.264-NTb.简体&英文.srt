{\an8}本片改编自1992-2009年伦敦西南
一系列强奸  性侵和抢劫的警方调查

11
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:10,680
{\an8}片中使用了部分化名
并为剧情需要而创作了一些角色和场景

00:00:15,530 --> 00:00:16,970
17年
'17 years.

13
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:21,080
这个人在17年间制造了无法言喻的痛苦的恐惧
'That's how long this man has inflicted untold pain and fear

14
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:23,850
强加于我们社区中最弱势的群体
'on the most vulnerable members of our community.'

15
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:32,220
他以为自己掌控这些街道
He thinks he owns those streets.

16
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:34,900
就像他掌控他闯入的那些家
Like he owns the homes he breaks into.

17
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:38,180
出去让他知道你们才是主人

我们这里显示的是所有在你检测范围周围
'What we've got here is all the available cameras

21
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,460
可用的监控摄像头
'on the edge of your plot.'

22
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:47,280
他昨晚犯案了
He was out last night.'

23
00:00:47,290 --> 00:00:48,540
三起盗窃
'Three burglaries.'

24
00:00:49,450 --> 00:00:51,520
他肯定还开了车
Yeah, he's got to be in a car as well.

25
00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:54,330
我赌他走了莫顿路  一路开过去
My money's on Morton Way, straight down.

26
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:56,860
{\an8}本剧由科林·萨顿和艾德·惠特摩尔构思
基于科林·萨顿的回忆录

27
00:00:55,570 --> 00:00:57,460
这是在我们的时间范围内
And that's the only vehicle to go down Morton Way

28
00:00:57,460 --> 00:00:58,320
唯一经过莫顿路的车
in our time frame.

29
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,640
那看起来像个小型面包车
That looks like a small people carrier to me.

30
00:01:00,650 --> 00:01:03,370
对  也许是赛飞利
Yeah, maybe a Zafira.

31
00:01:05,210 --> 00:01:07,500
差这么一点确实令人失望
'Coming so close is disappointing.

32
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:09,560
我很确定我们会有第二次机会
'I'm certain we'll get a second chance,

33
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:12,370
但前提是我们保持清醒和专注
'but only if we stay sharp and focused.'

接线员  您需要哪种服务
Operator, which service do you require?

35
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:18,600
警察  他闯入我家了
Police... He's breaking in!

36
00:01:18,610 --> 00:01:20,200
不好意思  你是说警察吗
I'm sorry, did you say police?

37
00:01:20,210 --> 00:01:24,140
-他在我家里  -你能藏起来吗  茜拉
- He's in my house! - 'Is there somewhere you can hide, Sheila?'

38
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:28,200
-茜拉  怎么了  -警察就要到了
- Sheila? What's happening? - The police are coming!

39
00:01:28,210 --> 00:01:29,160
警察就要到了
The police are coming!

40
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:30,700
警察就要到了
The police are coming!

41
00:01:33,970 --> 00:01:34,730
他在那
There he is!

48

-这家伙到底是何方神圣  -他只是个凡人  科林
- Who is this bloke? - He's just a man, Colin.

49
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:06,010
一个可悲  恶劣  无药可救的人渣
A sad, sorry, messed-up excuse for a man.

50
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:31,000
好了  请大家暂停工作  安静
All right, settle down. Settle down.

51
00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:33,220
谢谢  老大有话要说
Thank you. The guv'nor wants a word.

52
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:39,300
在与成功失之交臂两周后  我猜测
Two weeks after coming so close, I suspect,

53
00:02:39,850 --> 00:02:42,360
算了  我知道  因为我听到你们聊天了
oh, sod that, I know, cos I've heard you,

54
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:43,010
{\an8}第十六晚

55
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:44,360
有些同事认为他已经再次隐匿
some of you reckon he's gone to ground

56
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:48,890
所以现在的做法是完全彻底的浪费时间
and this is just a big, expensive waste of time.

57
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:55,040
我们那次失手确实可能吓得他更加谨慎
OK, the near-miss might've spooked him into packing up,

58
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:56,580
这点我承认
I concede that.

59
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:58,320
但我不认为他会停手
But I take a different view.

60
00:02:58,330 --> 00:03:01,760
我觉得这会让他回到  我们知道他自认为
I think it'll drive him back into operating in the one place

61
00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:03,940
安全的地方
we know he feels safe.

62
00:03:04,010 --> 00:03:07,040
我们的关键线索仍然是那辆灰色赛飞利
Our key lead remains the grey Zafira

63
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:08,800
这一点你们也了然于胸
and I know you all know that

64
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,420
但请大家再从不同角度仔细看一下这辆车
but take another look at these different angles.

65
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,800
将它们刻入脑海
Imprint them on your brain,

66
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:16,730
这样你们哪怕在远距离
so that at a glance, or from a distance,

67
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:18,220
也能一眼锁定它
you can clock it.

68
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,700
非常感谢大家
Thank you very much.

69
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:28,800
-34号  -谢谢  内森
- 34. - Cheers, Nath.

70
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:29,940
-给你  -谢谢  内森
- There you go. - Thanks, Nath.

71
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:33,860
-要完好的拿回来...  -你没事吧  老大
- Bring it back in one piece... - Are you all right, guv?

72
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:36,120
你在中央3000监控系统也看到了
Well, you've seen it at Central 3000,

73
00:03:36,130 --> 00:03:37,940
午夜之后毫无动静
after midnight nothing happens.

74
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,880
只有狐狸和一些好奇的猫
Foxes and a few inquisitive cats,

75
00:03:39,890 --> 00:03:41,240
夜里的动态也就如此而已
that's the extent of the action.

76
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:44,000
我真的很担心他们会开始打瞌睡
I am genuinely worried they're gonna start nodding off.

77
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:46,160
-不可能  老大  -或者他们习惯了无事发生
- No way, boss. - Or they get so used to nothing happening

78
00:03:46,170 --> 00:03:47,560
而不会在有情况时候及时发现
they don't clock it when it does.

79
00:03:47,570 --> 00:03:50,610
-我觉得不可能  -怎么不可能
- Well, I just can't see that. - Why not?

80
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:53,220
第一天晚上  他就在区域内径直开了过去
Very first night, he drove right through the plot.

81
00:03:53,570 --> 00:03:54,960
当时我们不知道他开一辆赛飞利
We didn't know he drove a Zafira then.

82
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:57,120
那晚总共才几辆车开过  五辆吗
How many vehicles went through that night? Five?

83
00:03:57,130 --> 00:03:58,520
他们最起码应该看到车牌
They could've at least got a reg!

84
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:00,220
无意冒犯  长官  但这有些苛刻了
With respect, Sir, that's harsh.

85
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:02,960
监控点的位置  在漆黑的夜里
Clocking the number plate from an OP

86
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:06,300
-看清车牌并不容易  -你说的也是  内维尔
- and in the dark isn't exactly easy. - Yeah, you're right, Neville.

87
00:04:06,570 --> 00:04:09,580
我只想在他停手之前抓到他
I just want to get him before they pull the plug on us.

88
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:12,100
-你觉得能很快做到吗  -我不知道
- You think that's imminent? - I don't know.

89
00:04:13,010 --> 00:04:13,640
跟我来
Come on.

90
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:16,340
今晚没有我们  中央3000监控系统也不会有问题
Central 3000 will manage for one night without us.

91
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:25,810
3号监控点就位
'OP3 in position.'

92
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,020
44号监控点就位

94
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:36,900
27号监控点就位
'OP27 in position.'

95
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,360
我们没预到会有这么高级别人来现场  长官
We weren't expecting such august company, Sir.

96
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:48,170
我们不想大肆宣扬  只想来看看你们怎么工作
Oh, well, we don't want any fuss, just want to see how it's done.

97
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:49,580
-这边走  -谢谢
- This way. - Thank you.

98
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:54,960
其实今晚我们少一个监控员
Actually, we're down an OP tonight

99
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,810
-有你们帮忙正好  -晚上好
- it's good to have you. - Evening.

100
00:04:57,650 --> 00:04:59,800
等窗帘拉上后我们会给你们倒杯喝的
We'll bring you a cuppa for when the curtain goes up.

101
00:04:59,810 --> 00:05:01,220
非常感谢
Much appreciated.

102
00:05:02,810 --> 00:05:04,460
如果你们能接管这里
If you can handle things here,

103
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:06,930
我们就去下一条街那边的侦查屋
we'll be in a scout hut down the next street.

104
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:19,900
别担心  我们不会在执勤时睡着的
Don't worry, we're not sleeping on the job.

105
00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:22,980
午夜过后这里会非常冷
After midnight it gets colder than a witch's tit in here.

106
00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:26,900
17号监控点就...
'OP17 in...'

107
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:29,730
-20号监控点就位  -收到
- 'OP20 in position.' - Received.

108
00:05:58,330 --> 00:05:59,540
{\an8}U2著名爱尔兰摇滚乐队

109
00:05:58,330 --> 00:05:59,540
你知道U2吗
Do you know U2?

110
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:04,020
-那个乐队吗  -对
- What, the band? - Yeah.

111
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:06,580
我当然知道  你以为我有多老
Yeah, course I do. How old d'you think I am?

112
00:06:08,890 --> 00:06:10,900
我小时候超级喜欢他们
I was massively into them as a kid.

113
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:15,220
我去过他们在温布利举办的《约书亚之树》巡演
I saw them at Wembley on The Joshua Tree tour.

114
00:06:15,450 --> 00:06:19,490
那张专辑很棒  我应该有一张黑胶版
That's a good album. I got it on vinyl somewhere.

115
00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:21,840
好吧  那你一定知道《射向蓝天》这首歌了
Right, so, you know the song, Bullet The Blue Sky?

116
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:27,460
-对  -我有件T恤上印着这歌的歌词
- Yeah. - Well, I had this t-shirt with the lyrics printed on it.

117
00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:29,610
就是"我看不到那些战斗机"那句
You know, "I can see those fighter planes,"

118
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,860
下面印的是一个怒吼女士的图
over a picture of a woman screaming.

119
00:06:32,690 --> 00:06:35,100
我非常喜欢那件衣服
I was dead pleased with it.

120
00:06:35,890 --> 00:06:37,880
很严肃  很有政治意义
You know, it was serious, political.

121
00:06:37,890 --> 00:06:40,400
是啊  好过"弗兰基说请放松"
Yeah. Not "Frankie says relax".

122
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,780
对  也好过"选择生活"
Right. Not "Choose life".

123
00:06:44,450 --> 00:06:46,580
但只要我穿那件衣服  我妈妈就会说
But whenever I wore it my mum would go,

124
00:06:47,130 --> 00:06:49,490
"现在你能看到那些战斗机了吗  小内"
"Can you see those fighter planes yet, Nev?"

125
00:06:51,690 --> 00:06:53,370
妈妈们就这样
That's mums for you, you know.

126
00:06:58,330 --> 00:06:59,900
你怎么想起这个了
What made you think of that?

127
00:07:03,810 --> 00:07:04,660
我不知道
Dunno.

128
00:07:06,130 --> 00:07:06,810
就...
Just...

129
00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:12,170
我确实没见过一架战斗机  所以也许...
I never did see any fighter planes, so maybe...

130
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:15,700
你现在也有那种感觉  对吗
You got that feeling now, have you?

131
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:21,300
对  我就那种感觉  老大
Yeah. Yeah, I do, guv.

132
00:07:21,890 --> 00:07:22,660
我是说...
I mean...

133
00:07:24,810 --> 00:07:29,900
...如果这样不起作用  那...之后怎么办
..if this doesn't work, then... what then?

134
00:07:34,130 --> 00:07:35,460
听我说
I tell you what.

135
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:40,260
只要他出现  我们就能抓到他
When he does show up, we've got him.

136
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:43,160
他只要踏入监控范围
He sets one foot on the plot

137
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:45,100
就会被被立刻...
and he'll stick out like a fucking...

138
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,800
所有人员  所有人员注意  6号监控点报告
All units, all units, from OP6, be aware.

139
00:07:52,810 --> 00:07:56,440
有一名男性  徒步从拉维妮娅花园走向莫顿大道
We have a male on foot, Lavinia Gardens towards Morton Avenue.

140
00:07:56,450 --> 00:07:59,490
深色帽衫套头  暂无更多描述  请待命
Dark hoody worn up, no better description, stand by.

141
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:05,660
他走进了拉维妮娅花园6号的私人车道
He's entering the driveway of number six Lavinia Gardens.

142
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:11,730
4号监控点  4号监控点  是否收到
OP4. OP4. Did you receive?

143
00:08:12,690 --> 00:08:14,020
4号监控点收到
'OP4. Received.'

144
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:19,100
待命  待命  他已经走到房子门前
Stand by, stand by. He's down the side of a house.

145
00:08:20,170 --> 00:08:22,820
行动组待命  随时准备行动
'Mobiles standing by and ready to deploy.'

146
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:25,460
我们可以看他怎么动手
We could be watching him work.

147
00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:28,980
别动手  我重复  不要动手  所有人待命
Negative, I repeat, negative, all units are to stand by.

148
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:31,300
可恶  那是什么  手电筒吗
Shit. What's that, a torch?

149
00:08:32,890 --> 00:08:35,380
-要行动吗  老大  -不
- Should we make a move, guv? - No.

150
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:38,260
不行  如果伪装暴露  也就毁掉了整个行动
No, if we blow our cover, then we've blown the op.

151
00:08:38,850 --> 00:08:40,540
再等一下  直到确定就是他
Just wait till we're sure it's him.

152
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:01,000
警报解除  警报解除
Stand down, stand down,

153
00:09:01,010 --> 00:09:03,040
只是一个年轻白人男性回家休息
it's a young white male going home to bed.

154
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:05,780
-他可真幸福  -6号监控点结束
- 'Lucky bastard.' - OP6 out.

155
00:09:06,130 --> 00:09:07,860
行动组撤退
'Mobiles standing down.'

156
00:09:25,850 --> 00:09:26,740
你没事吧
You ok?

157
00:09:28,130 --> 00:09:30,420
累得我浑身僵硬
I'm stiff as a board!

158
00:09:30,890 --> 00:09:33,260
真不知道他们怎么每晚坚持下来的
I don't know how they do it night after night.

159
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,980
首先  他们白天会睡觉
They sleep in the day, for one.

160
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,380
你就不能晚点去上班吗
Can't you go in later?

161
00:09:40,450 --> 00:09:42,440
我要参加一个健康安全汇报会
I've got a Health and Safety briefing.

162
00:09:42,450 --> 00:09:45,000
之前两场我都缺席  上面提醒我
I missed the last two and it's been suggested from above

163
00:09:45,010 --> 00:09:46,480
我最好关注这个方面
that I might want to start taking an interest.

164
00:09:46,490 --> 00:09:50,160
-否则呢  -我不会让他们有借口抢走我的任务
- Or what? - I'm not giving them any excuse to take my toys away.

165
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,120
你要是在M25公路上身亡
Well, you get killed on the M25,

166
00:09:52,130 --> 00:09:54,660
他们就是要去参加健康安全汇报会的人了
they'll be the ones who need Health and Safety.

167
00:09:56,090 --> 00:09:58,520
特派代表着领导力强而有力
You know, delegation's a hallmark of strong,

168
00:09:58,520 --> 00:09:59,930
-而不是软弱无能  -路易丝
- not weak, leadership. - Louise..

169
00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:01,760
你这是把自己往绝路上逼
You're running yourself into the ground.

170
00:10:01,770 --> 00:10:03,380
因为内森不在
Cos Nathan's away.

171
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:06,080
想在你的工作和生活间
It's possible to care about your job

172
00:10:06,090 --> 00:10:09,050
找到...怎么说  平衡  还是有可能的
and find... I don't know, balance.

173
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:13,520
-但我不行  -你认真试过吗
- Not for me. - How hard have you looked?

174
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:16,120
我就是这样的人  一旦投入  不计安危
That's the way I am, in for a penny, in for a pound.

175
00:10:16,130 --> 00:10:19,690
我羡慕那些能把工作就留在工作场所的人
I envy people who can leave their work at work.

176
00:10:19,890 --> 00:10:21,260
不  你才不羡慕
No, you don't.

177
00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:22,810
你要迟到了
You're gonna be late.

178
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,140
确实
Yes, I am.

179
00:10:34,090 --> 00:10:36,380
只是  过去这几周观察你...
It's watching you these last weeks...

180
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:43,900
我知道一直很压抑  紧张  殚精竭虑...
I know it's been frustrating, nerve-wracking, exhausting...

181
00:10:44,450 --> 00:10:46,420
但我不太确定...
I'm just not sure...

182
00:10:48,010 --> 00:10:53,260
我不确定...是只因为要抓住这个人吗
I'm just not sure... it's just about catching this man.

183
00:10:53,450 --> 00:10:54,500
什么意思
What d'you mean?

184
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,720
我觉得你这么投入这个案子
I think you're going at it this hard

185
00:10:58,730 --> 00:11:00,540
是因为你知道这是最后一次...
because you know it's the last time...

186
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:07,210
...而这个事实让你前所未有的害怕
..and you're dreading that more than anything.

187
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:09,840
就看看你自己
I mean, just look at you.

188
00:11:09,850 --> 00:11:11,520
你整晚在外挨冻
You're out all night in the cold

189
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:14,210
今早还准备正常上班
and straight back in this morning.

190
00:11:15,730 --> 00:11:18,280
你什么都不想错过  也不愿浪费时间睡觉
You don't want to miss a thing, or waste time sleeping,

191
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:22,620
因为你知道退休后心里会有多空虚
cos you know how big a hole that's gonna leave.

192
00:11:23,970 --> 00:11:28,740
我也不怪你  我怎么会怪你呢
And I don't blame you. How could I?

193
00:11:29,010 --> 00:11:31,540
这是你最熟悉的事情  你就是这样的人
You're in your element, it's just who you are.

194
00:11:32,090 --> 00:11:35,720
我只希望当这些都结束  当你退休...
I just hope when it's over, when you're done...

195
00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:40,540
我们现有的生活能令你满足  我能令你满足
that what we have is enough. That I'm enough.

196
00:11:45,730 --> 00:11:49,740
你也能满足于酒吧小游戏和花园中心
And you can make your peace with pub quizzes and garden centres.

197
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,760
前半句没问题  后半句不行
Yes to the former, no to the latter.

198
00:11:51,770 --> 00:11:52,920
好吧  你又要拿这事取笑了
Oh, go on, make a joke of it.

199
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:55,420
-除非被胁迫或者假装可以  -科林
- Unless under duress or in disguise. - Colin.

200
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:00,980
你说得对
You're right.

201
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:03,380
我很害怕接下来要发生什么
I am scared about what's next.

202
00:12:03,770 --> 00:12:07,140
我只知道工作  说真的
The job's all I know and, to be honest,

203
00:12:07,610 --> 00:12:09,930
我都不敢想象退休后是什么样
I can't even imagine what it's gonna be like.

204
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:19,780
-好了  我得走了  -但我们会没事  对吗
- Right, I'd better go. - We'll be all right, though?

205
00:12:22,330 --> 00:12:23,620
希望如此
I hope so.

206
00:12:36,010 --> 00:12:37,320
我们都准备好了
We are all set.

207
00:12:37,330 --> 00:12:39,840
监控点随时会报告就位
Observation points will be radioing in any minute.

208
00:12:39,850 --> 00:12:40,860
谢谢  米歇尔
Cheers, Michelle.

209
00:12:46,370 --> 00:12:49,330
{\an8}第十七晚

210
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:52,720
你们好  他们提前一天放了我们
All right? They let us go a day early.

211
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:55,400
真的吗  为什么  表现好的奖励吗
Oh, yeah? What's that, time off for good behaviour?

212
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,660
差不多是这意思  对
Something like that, yeah.

213
00:12:57,090 --> 00:12:59,480
-怎么样  -还行
- How was it? - Yeah, fine.

214
00:12:59,490 --> 00:13:02,280
但是  你忙了好一阵了
But, erm, you've had a bit of a time of it,

215
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:05,020
所以我现在放你去休息
so I'm relieving you as of now.

216
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,800
不用  好意我心领了  但是我已经来了...
Oh, no, I appreciate the thought but I'm here now...

217
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:10,720
我支持他的决定  拜托就赶紧离开
I second that. Do us all a favour and bugger off.

218
00:13:10,730 --> 00:13:12,690
-要来杯咖啡吗  -好  麻烦你了
- Do you want a coffee? - Yeah, please.

219
00:13:12,730 --> 00:13:14,380
明天也休息吧
Take tomorrow off, too.

220
00:13:15,090 --> 00:13:16,570
是周末了  老大
It's the weekend, guv.

221
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:25,080
好  行  好吧  那谢谢
Ok. All right. Yeah. OK, cheers.

222
00:13:25,090 --> 00:13:26,280
有什么我需要知道的事吗
Anything I should know?

223
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:28,720
怎么说呢  尽管希望越来越渺茫
Er, well, in the increasingly unlikely event

224
00:13:28,730 --> 00:13:30,720
我们似乎都已经没有犯人可阻止了...
that we should actually need to stop someone...

225
00:13:30,730 --> 00:13:33,360
科林·萨顿  大失所望吗  我可不相信
Colin Sutton, disillusioned? I don't believe it.

226
00:13:33,370 --> 00:13:35,000
我们一定要注意
It is essential that we do it

227
00:13:35,010 --> 00:13:37,500
逮捕地离监控区域越远越好
as far away from the plot as possible.

228
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:38,200
好吧
Ok...?

229
00:13:38,210 --> 00:13:39,480
这样就算嫌疑人被排除
So that if they are ruled out they

230
00:13:39,490 --> 00:13:41,260
他们也不会知道自己是在哪被盯上的
won't know where they were stopped.

231
00:13:41,730 --> 00:13:44,980
这样暴露行动和行动地点的可能就会降低
Less chance of the op and its location leaking?

232
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:48,000
你能回来真的太好了  内森
Nice to have you back, Nathan.

233
00:13:48,010 --> 00:13:50,040
谢谢你  谢谢
Thank you. Thank you.

234
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:50,810
晚安
Good night

235
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:18,100
九点钟方向
Nine o'clock.

236
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:23,450
那是辆赛飞利吗  就在雪铁龙后面
That's a Zafira, right? Behind that red Citroen.

237
00:14:26,970 --> 00:14:28,860
对  那是一辆赛飞利
Yeah, that's a Zafira.

238
00:14:29,010 --> 00:14:31,660
小改款  颜色也符合
Facelifted model and the colour's right, too.

239
00:14:32,010 --> 00:14:33,200
而且过去两周
And it wasn't parked there

240
00:14:33,210 --> 00:14:35,620
该车没停在那里或附近任何街道上
or any of the surrounding streets in the last fortnight.

241
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:39,300
马上报告
Call it in.

242
00:14:40,650 --> 00:14:42,680
控制中心  控制中心  6号监控点报告
Control, Control from OP6,

243
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:44,300
我能通报一下吗
can I give a circulation?

244
00:14:46,450 --> 00:14:47,570
说吧  6号监控点报告
'Go ahead, Six.'

245
00:14:48,490 --> 00:14:50,080
我们发现了辆灰色赛飞利
We have a grey Zafira

246
00:14:50,090 --> 00:14:53,560
朝东停在我们哨点对面的拉维妮娅花园
parked opposite our OP on Lavinia Gardens, facing east.

247
00:14:53,570 --> 00:14:54,800
我们之前从未见过这辆车
We haven't seen it before.

248
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:57,400
车的颜色和年代都很符合
It's of the right colour and age to be of interest,

249
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:59,240
所以请各部门记住这一点
so can all units please bear this in mind

250
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:01,240
以防我们随后通报该车动向
in case we put it up as moving later?

251
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:04,480
收到  6号监控点  全体注意  全体注意
All received, OP6. All units, all units, please be aware

252
00:15:04,490 --> 00:15:06,120
有辆灰色沃克斯豪尔赛飞利
there is a grey Vauxhall Zafira

253
00:15:06,130 --> 00:15:09,020
朝东停在拉维妮娅花园
stationary on Lavinia Gardens, facing east.

254
00:15:09,090 --> 00:15:10,800
该车之前从未出现过
It has not been seen previously

255
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:13,520
如有任何动作  6号监控点会更新消息
and OP6 will update if there is any movement.

256
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:14,930
控制中心下线
Control out.

257
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:18,020
一点车牌都看不到吗
Not even a partial on the reg?

258
00:15:18,490 --> 00:15:20,500
抱歉  视线完全被挡住了
'Sorry, totally blocked from view.'

259
00:15:21,370 --> 00:15:24,300
可以让人去现场看看吗
Someone could stretch their legs, get it that way?

260
00:15:26,010 --> 00:15:28,380
不行  不能冒险  待在原地
No. Can't risk it. Stay in position.

261
00:15:28,730 --> 00:15:29,570
明白
Understood.

262
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:39,720
-你好  亲爱的  -你好
- Hello, love. - Hello.

268
00:15:51,330 --> 00:15:54,140
巴西队的比赛对你早回来没有吸引力吗

他看上去可能要去另一栋房子作案
By the looks of things he could be off to hit a new house,

00:23:58,660 --> 00:24:00,380
是嘛  挺好
Oh, right. OK.

392
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:02,790
这么晚你出来干什么
And what are you doing out this late?

393
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:07,060
我在合作社外面等着想买些烟
I was waiting outside the Co-op to buy some puff,

394
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:09,480
可那家伙一直没露面
but the guy never showed.

395
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:11,140
亚当
Adam.

396
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:17,100
请你走出车来  德尔罗伊
Would you like to step out of the vehicle, please, Delroy?

397
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:22,250
德尔罗伊·格兰特  我以涉嫌
Delroy Grant, I am arresting you

398
00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:26,060
强奸  入室盗窃和猥亵罪逮捕你
on suspicion of rape, burglary and indecent assault.

399
00:24:26,060 --> 00:24:28,300
你有权保持沉默  但询问过程中
You do not have to say anything, but it may harm your defence

400
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:30,380
你避而不谈的问题都将在后续的庭审中
if you do not mention when questioned

401
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:32,620
可能会成为对你不利的证据
something which you later rely on in court.

402
00:24:51,770 --> 00:24:52,580
科林·萨顿
Colin Sutton.

403
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:55,180
科林  我是内森  看起来我们抓住他了
'Colin, it's Nathan. Looks like we've got him.'

404
00:24:55,180 --> 00:24:57,820
操  你逗我吧
Fuck. You're joking?

405
00:24:58,490 --> 00:25:00,380
你真觉得我会在凌晨三点
Do you really think I'd joke about something like that

406
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:01,730
开这样的玩笑吗
at three in the morning?

407
00:25:01,730 --> 00:25:04,340
我想不会  你确定是他吗
'No, I suppose not. Are you sure it's him?'

408
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:06,250
这么说吧
Well, put it this way,

409
00:25:06,250 --> 00:25:09,620
我们从他银灰色的赛飞利上起获了
we recovered his grey top with black stripes

410
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:12,100
他那件有黑色条纹的灰色上衣
from his silver-grey facelifted Zafira.

411
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:14,450
-科尔布里奇路的那段监控吗  -完全吻合
- The Colbridge Road footage? - 'Perfect match,

412
00:25:14,450 --> 00:25:17,100
加上他后备箱里有根撬棒和一把螺丝刀
'plus he had a crowbar and a screwdriver in the boot.

413
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:17,860
虽然为时尚早
'It's early days,

414
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:21,580
但我认为那些撬痕正是后者弄出来的
'but I'd say the latter probably made all those pry marks.'

415
00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:23,970
我的天  他叫什么
Bloody hell! What's his name?

416
00:25:24,250 --> 00:25:26,970
德尔罗伊·伊斯顿·格兰特
Delroy Easton Grant.

417
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:31,140
从指挥延续性的角度
From a continuity of command angle,

418
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:34,060
或许由我继续指挥到早上会更合理一些...
it probably makes sense for me to carry it on till morning...

419
00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:37,450
很高兴那个高级调查官的课程没有白上
Good to see that SIO course wasn't wasted.

420
00:25:37,450 --> 00:25:40,730
是啊  没想到这么快我就用上了
'Yeah, didn't think I'd put it to use quite so soon.'

421
00:25:40,730 --> 00:25:43,490
干得漂亮  内森  干得漂亮
This is great work, Nathan, it's great work.

422
00:25:43,490 --> 00:25:45,900
请你替我转达给大家吧
Please pass that onto the others for me, will you?

423
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:47,580
嗯  我会的
Yeah. Will do.

424
00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:51,220
-我们八点见  -嗯  回头见
- I'll see you at eight. - 'Yeah. See you then.'

425
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:05,860
你和谁讲这么久
Who are you kidding?

426
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:09,290
我们抓住他了
We got him.

427
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:15,770
我去把水烧上
I'll put the kettle on.

428
00:26:44,290 --> 00:26:45,890
-西蒙·摩根  -我是科林·萨顿
- 'Simon Morgan.' - It's Colin Sutton.

429
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:47,620
抱歉这么早给你打电话
I'm sorry to call you so early,

430
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:49,810
但我想亲自告诉你
but I wanted you to hear it from me,

431
00:26:49,810 --> 00:26:51,140
看起来我们抓住他了
it looks like we've got him.

432
00:26:53,740 --> 00:26:54,620
西蒙
Simon?

433
00:26:54,740 --> 00:26:57,610
嗯  我还在  老天
'Yeah, I'm still here. Fucking hell.'

434
00:26:57,620 --> 00:26:59,010
对  我也是这么说的
Yeah, that's what I said.

435
00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:01,730
我们位于拉维妮娅花园的一个监控点发现...
One of our OPs on Lavinia Gardens saw...

436
00:27:01,730 --> 00:27:02,490
我这就过来
'I'm on my way in.'

437
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:05,580
好  等你到了我把情况告诉你
OK, I'll fill you in when you get here.

438
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:21,970
这位我们老大  萨顿先生
This is the boss, Mr Sutton.

439
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:26,290
你好  长官
Hello, sir.

440
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:29,770
真是幸会啊
I'm so pleased to meet you.

441
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:34,900
你是要击球还是投球啊
So what are you, batting or bowling?

442
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:39,650
你不太喜欢板球吧  长官
You're not into cricket, are you, sir?

443
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:42,410
-喜欢啊  -但你还是不打吧
- Yeah. - But you still don't play?

444
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:45,170
实际上我打  偶尔打  你呢
I do, as a matter of fact, yeah, occasionally. You?

445
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:47,530
打  我当然打了  击球和投球
Yes, yes, of course I do. Bat and bowl.

446
00:27:47,530 --> 00:27:50,210
那真不错啊  我的膝盖不允许我投球了
Oh, good for you. My knees won't let me bowl,

447
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:53,220
但我还能像以往一样地挥棒
but I can still swing a bat around as well as I ever could.

448
00:27:54,010 --> 00:27:54,940
告诉我  长官
Well, tell me, sir,

449
00:27:55,530 --> 00:27:58,140
你觉得英格兰在南非的机会怎么样
what do you think of England's chances in South Africa?

450
00:27:59,140 --> 00:28:01,570
我认为我们可以再加一名快投手
I think we could do with one more fast bowler

451
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:03,330
但是我觉得我们有很大的机会
but, er, I think we've got a great chance.

452
00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:05,220
没错  我一直也这么说
Yeah, man, that's what I've been saying!

453
00:28:11,010 --> 00:28:12,570
长官  得告诉你一下
Just so you're aware, sir,

454
00:28:12,580 --> 00:28:15,810
我妻子患了多发性硬化症  我是她主要的护工
my wife suffers from MS and I'm her primary carer.

455
00:28:15,810 --> 00:28:17,860
很明显  这会让她受惊
Obviously, this'll come as a shock to her.

456
00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:20,660
我想会吧
Yeah, I imagine it will.

457
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:24,970
我只想确保她会受到照顾
Well, I just want to make sure she's properly taken care of.

458
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:28,700
-否则我会很担心  -抱歉打断一下
- I'll be worried otherwise. - Sorry to interrupt.

459
00:28:28,770 --> 00:28:32,060
格兰特先生  请您签署一下DNA取样好吗
Mr Grant, could I have your signature for the DNA sample?

460
00:28:43,650 --> 00:28:45,100
现在去录指纹吧
Prints now, please.

461
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:49,140
这边
This way.

462
00:28:58,460 --> 00:29:02,450
-还用老式的方法呢  -对  还是湿定型好用
- Still doing 'em old school? - Oh, yeah. Can't beat a wet set.

463
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:04,010
请把右手给我
I need your right hand, please.

464
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:33,970
不明白你为什么要费这个劲
Don't know why you're bothering,

465
00:29:35,290 --> 00:29:37,100
你们知道我总是戴着手套
you know I always wore gloves.

466
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:49,770
刚刚你说了句很有意思的话啊
That was an interesting comment you made just now

467
00:29:49,770 --> 00:29:51,460
关于总是戴着手套的那句话
about always wearing gloves.

468
00:29:51,980 --> 00:29:53,300
我们能取一个你的签名吗
Er, could we get a signature off you,

469
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:54,850
只是确认你说了那句话
just to confirm you made it?

470
00:30:00,530 --> 00:30:01,560
你今晚是否接触过
Have you had any contact

471
00:30:01,570 --> 00:30:04,810
任何体弱或年长的人  德尔罗伊
with a vulnerable or an elderly person tonight, Delroy?

472
00:30:07,650 --> 00:30:10,000
没有一个屁股摔坏了
There's no-one out there with a broken hip

473
00:30:10,010 --> 00:30:11,440
无法拿到电话的人吗
who can't get to the phone?

474
00:30:12,250 --> 00:30:14,370
没人需要帮助和注意吗
No-one in need of help and attention?

475
00:30:16,330 --> 00:30:19,010
我今晚没见任何人
I haven't visited anyone tonight.

476
00:30:22,610 --> 00:30:23,800
如果你有什么不明白
Very important that you ask

477
00:30:23,810 --> 00:30:27,200
请务必问清楚  德尔罗伊  好吗
if there's anything you don't understand, Delroy. OK?

478
00:30:28,370 --> 00:30:32,640
-天呐  天呐  天呐  -怎么了  德尔罗伊
- Oh, dear, oh, dear, oh, dear. - What is it, Delroy?

479
00:30:36,290 --> 00:30:38,680
你们最好去调查一下我儿子
You really want to have a look at my son.

480
00:30:39,650 --> 00:30:40,680
你儿子
Your son?

481
00:30:40,810 --> 00:30:44,810
这对我来说很难...非常难
This is hard for me... so hard...

482
00:30:46,770 --> 00:30:48,960
但鉴于这些罪名的严重性
..but given the seriousness of the offences,

483
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:51,330
我希望你们能抓对人
I want to make sure you get the right man.

484
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:56,530
他的DNA会跟我的一样  或很类似
His DNA's gonna be the same as mine, or very similar,

485
00:30:56,680 --> 00:31:00,680
外加我们身高一致  而且他住在附近
plus we're the same height, and he lives in the area.

486
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:07,440
你为什么直到现在才告诉我  德尔罗伊
Why did you wait until now to tell us this, Delroy?

487
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:12,850
我依然处于受惊状态
I'm still in a state of shock.

488
00:31:14,090 --> 00:31:16,000
-胡扯  -对  当然是胡扯
- Bullshit. - Yeah, course it's bullshit.

489
00:31:16,010 --> 00:31:18,200
双胞胎的DNA一样  但父子不可能
Twins can share DNA, but not fathers and sons.

490
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:20,160
但他说得对  仍然可能很相似
He's right, though, they can be very similar.

491
00:31:20,290 --> 00:31:22,360
-我们需要查这个吗  -对  我们得打几个电话
- We need to jump on this? - Yeah, we need to make some calls.

492
00:31:22,370 --> 00:31:24,920
让帕特丽夏去查儿子  然后我们取样
Get Patricia to look the son up and we can get a sample.

493
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:27,530
-好  立刻去办  老大  -并告诉她我一起去
- Yeah. Will do, boss. - And tell her I want to be there.

494
00:31:37,330 --> 00:31:38,330
你可没闲着
You didn't hang about.

495
00:31:38,890 --> 00:31:40,760
-我们确定是他吗  -我想是的
- We're sure it's him? - Yeah, I think so.

496
00:31:40,770 --> 00:31:43,570
-DNA会确认  -他在系统里吗
- The DNA will confirm. - Was he in the system?

497
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:47,160
还不知道  我直接来了这里  恭喜
TBC - I came straight here. Congratulations.

498
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:49,280
你的大日子  你的案子破了
Your day, your case,

499
00:31:49,290 --> 00:31:52,130
-我只是帮忙跨过了终点线  -谢谢
- I just helped it over the finish line. - Thank you.

500
00:31:53,330 --> 00:31:55,280
-我去看看团队  -好  我也去
- I'll go check on the team. - Yeah, I'll join you.

501
00:31:55,290 --> 00:31:58,010
-我只想看看他的脸  -当然
- I just wanna see his face. - Sure, yeah.

502
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:32,730
好吧  所以他在系统里吗
OK, was he in the system or not?

503
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:36,970
-很复杂  -他没开玩笑
- It's complicated. - He's not kidding.

504
00:32:37,090 --> 00:32:39,240
听完他们解释后我不得不去躺会
I had to go and have a lie down when they explained it.

505
00:32:39,250 --> 00:32:42,530
-只有你这样  肯尼  -说吧  内森
- That's just you, Kenny. - Go on, Nath.

506
00:32:44,490 --> 00:32:48,090
99年在布罗姆利有一起盗窃
There's a burglary, back in '99 in Bromley.

507
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:50,320
地方警察通知了米恩斯泰德团队
Local police inform the Minstead team,

508
00:32:50,330 --> 00:32:53,090
但他们认为不是米恩斯泰德犯
but they don't think it's Minstead Man.

509
00:32:53,130 --> 00:32:55,210
-不符合标准吗  -对
- Didn't fit the criteria? - No.

510
00:32:55,250 --> 00:32:57,120
所以布罗姆利就自己调查了
So Bromley go ahead and investigate.

511
00:32:57,130 --> 00:32:59,840
受害者有一个邻居看到一辆车
Now a neighbour of the victim sees a car

512
00:32:59,850 --> 00:33:01,680
她觉得有些可疑
that she thinks looks suspicious

513
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:03,160
于是就上报了车牌
and she reports the number.

514
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:06,160
他们一查发现登记在德尔罗伊·格兰特名字
They run a trace and it's registered to a Delroy Grant

515
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:08,160
地址是森林山
at an address in Forest Hill.

516
00:33:08,650 --> 00:33:10,370
他们把他名字输入全国警察数据库
They put his name in the PNC.

517
00:33:11,090 --> 00:33:13,290
结果发现有六个名字一样的人
It IDs six people of that name.

518
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:17,490
一个在哈克尼  有盗窃犯罪史  也登记了DNA
One in Hackney, had a burglary conviction. DNA on file.

519
00:33:19,650 --> 00:33:22,370
好  那这份样本和我们的犯罪现场样本呢
Right. And this sample was compared to our scenes?

520
00:33:23,370 --> 00:33:25,290
他们通知我们说哈克尼的德尔罗伊
They informed us that Hackney Delroy

521
00:33:25,290 --> 00:33:26,370
不是米恩斯泰德犯
wasn't Minstead Man.

522
00:33:27,530 --> 00:33:30,520
-听着很简单  -对  只不过不知为何那份结果
- Sounds straightforward. - Yeah, except somehow that result

523
00:33:30,530 --> 00:33:33,480
被登记到了森林山的德尔罗伊档案名下
became assigned to Forest Hill Delroy's profile

524
00:33:33,490 --> 00:33:35,960
并在我们的系统里建档了
and a nominal was created on our system.

525
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:37,640
他们的错误成了我们的错误
Their mistake became our mistake?

526
00:33:37,650 --> 00:33:40,050
对  而且还没完
Yeah. And it gets worse.

527
00:33:41,050 --> 00:33:44,080
我们队里有个警员在去找森林山的德尔罗伊
A DC from our team went to visit Forest Hill Delroy

528
00:33:44,090 --> 00:33:46,730
调查他盗窃案当晚的行踪
to check his movements on the night of the burglary.

529
00:33:49,330 --> 00:33:50,330
嗯  然后呢
Yeah, and...?

530
00:33:51,890 --> 00:33:55,010
他没在家  结果也没再继续跟进了
He was out and it was never followed up.

531
00:33:55,850 --> 00:33:58,290
-那就是我们抓的德尔罗伊吗  -对
- And that's the Delroy we just nicked? - Yeah.

532
00:34:00,090 --> 00:34:01,210
转到右侧
Turn to your right.

533
00:34:03,490 --> 00:34:04,640
如果采样了他的DNA
If his DNA had been taken,

534
00:34:04,650 --> 00:34:07,330
立马就能鉴定出他是米恩斯泰德犯
he would have instantly been identified as Minstead Man.

535
00:34:08,890 --> 00:34:09,800
天呐
Christ...

536
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:13,530
从那刻起  德尔罗伊·格兰特这个人就被排除了
From that moment on, the name Delroy Grant was ruled out.

537
00:34:14,450 --> 00:34:15,570
转向左侧
Turn to your left.

538
00:34:19,930 --> 00:34:21,520
他也没在取样名单上吗
And he wasn't on the swabbing list?

539
00:34:21,530 --> 00:34:24,320
对  因为之前因DNA错误被排除了
No, been formally eliminated by DNA.

540
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:27,450
-所以就算用DNA取样法你们也抓不住他  -对
- So you'd never have got him that way anyway? - No.

541
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:30,600
在2001年  德尔罗伊·格兰特这个名字又出现
In 2001, the name Delroy Grant cropped up again

542
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:33,880
当时有人拨打热线  说他是嫌犯
when someone called the hotline pushing him as a suspect.

543
00:34:33,890 --> 00:34:36,400
那是在《犯罪调查》节目播出后
It was after one of those Crimewatch appeals.

544
00:34:36,410 --> 00:34:37,680
但没有采取任何行动
And the action got binned

545
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:40,490
因为犯罪数据库说他测了DNA  被排除了
because HOLMES said he'd been cleared by DNA.

546
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:42,890
十年前
Ten years ago.

547
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:45,850
十年
A decade.

548
00:34:48,490 --> 00:34:50,130
自那以后有多少受害者
How many victims since then?

549
00:35:12,570 --> 00:35:14,090
小德尔罗伊·格兰特
'Delroy Grant Jr?'

550
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:16,090
请进
Come in.

551
00:35:23,650 --> 00:35:25,600
有人跟你一起住这里吗  德尔罗伊
Does, er, anyone live here with you, Delroy?

552
00:35:25,610 --> 00:35:29,320
我妈和我哥  什么事
My mum and my brother. What's this about?

553
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:32,320
你没惹麻烦  也没有人去世  不是这类事
You're not in any trouble. No-one's died, it's nothing like that.

554
00:35:33,010 --> 00:35:36,450
但我们有些不太好开口的消息要告诉你
But we do have some difficult news to share with you.

555
00:35:37,530 --> 00:35:38,370
好
Ok...

556
00:35:39,970 --> 00:35:41,570
听着  能坐下吗
Look, can we sit down?

557
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:52,970
你听说过黑夜狩猎者的案子吗  德尔罗伊
Are you familiar with the Night Stalker case, Delroy?

558
00:35:53,890 --> 00:35:56,410
-听说过  袭击老妇人的家伙  -对
- Yeah, the bloke attacking old ladies? - That's right.

559
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:59,570
新闻上说你们逮捕了一个人
Said on the news you arrested someone.

560
00:36:00,010 --> 00:36:02,090
是的  没错
We have, that's correct.

561
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:05,080
我很遗憾地通知你
I'm very sorry to tell you that

562
00:36:05,090 --> 00:36:08,320
被逮捕的人是你父亲  德尔罗伊·伊斯顿·格兰特
that man is your father, Delroy Easton Grant.

563
00:36:10,450 --> 00:36:11,370
不
No.

564
00:36:15,530 --> 00:36:17,050
不可能  绝对不是
No way. It can't be.

565
00:36:18,970 --> 00:36:19,890
你们
How...

566
00:36:22,050 --> 00:36:23,370
你们有多确认
How sure are you?

567
00:36:24,010 --> 00:36:26,480
我们还没有百分百的确认
Well, we don't have absolute confirmation yet,

568
00:36:26,490 --> 00:36:28,970
但如果没有极大把握  我们也不会来这里
but we wouldn't be here unless we were very sure.

569
00:36:29,970 --> 00:36:31,570
你跟你父亲多久见一次
How often do you see your dad?

570
00:36:32,490 --> 00:36:33,610
偶尔吧
Now and then.

571
00:36:35,050 --> 00:36:37,680
我们有很长一段时间与他没有来往
For a long time we had nothing to do with him.

572
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:39,050
"我们"
"We"?

573
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:42,090
我  我妈  我哥
Me, Mum, my brother...

574
00:36:42,130 --> 00:36:43,240
为什么
Why was that?

575
00:36:43,850 --> 00:36:47,760
他在我还是小婴儿时弃我们而去  我想是两岁
Well, he walked out when I was a toddler. Two, I think.

576
00:37:11,890 --> 00:37:12,680
对
Yeah.

577
00:37:14,450 --> 00:37:16,530
直到我8还是9岁才再次见到他
Didn't see him again till I was eight or nine.

578
00:37:20,450 --> 00:37:21,920
有一天突然出现在学校门外
Turned up at the school gates one day

579
00:37:21,930 --> 00:37:24,850
答应要周末带我和我哥去游泳
and promised to take me and my brother swimming at the weekend.

580
00:37:26,890 --> 00:37:29,840
妈妈不太乐意  但她看我们这么期待
Mum wasn't keen, but she saw how excited we were

581
00:37:29,850 --> 00:37:31,410
就改变了主意
and changed her mind.

582
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:33,490
我高兴坏了
I was giddy.

583
00:37:33,930 --> 00:37:36,920
就像...圣诞节早晨的孩子
Like a... kid on Christmas morning.

584
00:37:36,930 --> 00:37:38,510
我很早就收拾好了的东西
Had my bags packed hours before

585
00:37:38,510 --> 00:37:40,160
比他预定来接我的时间提前好几个小时
he was supposed to pick me up.

586
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:45,490
我记得自己很想向他展示我的后空翻
I remember I really wanted to show him my backflip.

587
00:37:47,930 --> 00:37:49,240
真可悲
Pathetic, really...

588
00:37:50,930 --> 00:37:52,370
但他没来吗
But he never turned up?

589
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:59,930
我一直没再见到他  直到我二十多岁  而且
I didn't see him again till I was in my 20s and...

590
00:38:01,410 --> 00:38:02,610
那时我已经知道了
by then I knew.

591
00:38:03,930 --> 00:38:06,530
-知道什么  -他对我妈干的事
- Knew...? - What he'd done to Mum.

592
00:38:07,130 --> 00:38:08,960
暴力  殴打
The violence. The beatings.

593
00:38:08,970 --> 00:38:10,370
他让她经历的一切
What he'd put her through.

594
00:38:17,890 --> 00:38:19,280
那些可怜的女人
Those poor women...

595
00:38:20,610 --> 00:38:23,130
是谁先联系谁的  你还是你爸
Who got back in touch, you or your dad?

596
00:38:23,530 --> 00:38:24,450
我
Me.

597
00:38:26,930 --> 00:38:28,050
我和我哥哥
Me and my brother.

598
00:38:29,490 --> 00:38:31,490
有人告诉我们他再婚了
Someone told us that he'd remarried.

599
00:38:31,530 --> 00:38:35,960
他妻子有多发性硬化症  说他是个完美的丈夫
That his wife had MS and what an amazing husband he was,

600
00:38:35,970 --> 00:38:37,450
是个体贴的看护
what an amazing carer...

601
00:38:38,050 --> 00:38:40,240
-你肯定难以相信吧  -对
- That must've been difficult to believe? - Yeah.

602
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:44,410
我想着"我得亲眼看看"  所以我们去了
"This I have to see," I thought. So we go round.

603
00:38:45,650 --> 00:38:47,570
"好啊  爸  好久不见"
"Hello, Dad. Long time, no see."

604
00:38:49,610 --> 00:38:50,640
都是真的
All true.

605
00:38:52,570 --> 00:38:55,720
他的妻子人很好  但她需要很多照顾
His wife was sweet, but she needed a lot of care...

606
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:58,970
然后他在那  细心地照顾
and there he was, providing it.

607
00:38:59,970 --> 00:39:02,850
体贴  耐心  井井有条
Kind, patient, everything organised.

608
00:39:03,610 --> 00:39:06,370
我不嫉妒她  我怎么能呢  但我...
I didn't begrudge her, how could I? But...

609
00:39:07,130 --> 00:39:08,370
看着很难受
Hard to see.

610
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:15,490
我们还要告诉你些其他事  德尔罗伊
Something else we need to tell you, Delroy.

611
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:18,880
我们完全不相信
We're giving it no credit whatsoever

612
00:39:18,890 --> 00:39:22,440
但你父亲称是你犯下了那些罪行
but your father has accused you of committing these crimes.

613
00:39:22,450 --> 00:39:23,480
-什么  -对
- What...? - Yeah.

614
00:39:23,490 --> 00:39:25,520
就像帕特丽夏说的  我们完全不信
As Patricia said, we don't believe it for a minute,

615
00:39:25,530 --> 00:39:28,640
但我们必须通过DNA测试排除你
but, er, we will have to eliminate you with a DNA test.

616
00:39:28,650 --> 00:39:30,490
抱歉  等等  他说.
Sorry, hang on, he said...

617
00:39:31,890 --> 00:39:34,850
强奸和那一切  他说都是我干的
The rapes and everything? He said it was me?

618
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:39,280
他为什么要这么说
Why would he say that?

619
00:39:39,850 --> 00:39:41,530
因为他就是这种人
Because that's the sort of person he is,

620
00:39:41,930 --> 00:39:44,370
而且从你刚才告诉我们的来看  他一直是
and, from what you're telling us, always was.

621
00:40:06,130 --> 00:40:07,320
-给你  -谢谢
- There you go. - Thanks.

622
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:10,330
他们没有鳄梨泥  我给你买了火腿芝士
They didn't have any torn avocado, I got you ham and cheese.

623
00:40:10,610 --> 00:40:11,570
给
There you go.

624
00:40:14,530 --> 00:40:18,570
我奶奶92岁了依然染发  所剩无几的头发
My nan's 92 and still dyes her hair... what's left of it.

625
00:40:19,970 --> 00:40:22,640
她说当你变老后  似乎就失去了身份
She said when you get old it's like you lose your identity.

626
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:27,130
人们看不见你  只看到一个老人
People don't see you, they just see an old person -

627
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:31,610
白头发  浅色大衣  老花镜  羊群中的一只
grey hair, fawn coat, bad glasses, a sheep in a flock.

628
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:37,490
所以这案子这么久都没破  隐形的受害者
That's why this went on so long. Victims were invisible.

629
00:40:37,650 --> 00:40:40,610
对  但我们其他人却不承认
Yeah, and the rest of us are in denial.

630
00:40:41,370 --> 00:40:42,760
我们都认为不会发生在自己身上
We all think it won't happen to us.

631
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:43,560
我们能逆势而行
We'll buck the trend.

632
00:40:43,570 --> 00:40:47,050
便盆  假牙
Bedpans, false teeth,

633
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:50,760
痴呆  助行架  不可能  不必了  我们不会
dementia, Zimmer frame. No way, no thanks. Not us, mate.

634
00:40:52,930 --> 00:40:55,200
而我们助长谎言的方式是忽略他们
And the way we feed that lie is to ignore them.

635
00:40:56,650 --> 00:40:58,930
我们注意到他们  但却视而不见
I mean, we notice them, but we don't see them.

636
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:02,560
我们不会避开视线  但也绝不会多看一眼
We don't avert our gaze, but we certainly don't linger

637
00:41:02,570 --> 00:41:05,240
因为他们是我们不想要却逃不过的未来
cos they're the future we don't want and can't escape.

638
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:08,200
对  就像我们在责备他们一般  对吧
Yeah. It's like we blame them, innit.

639
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:09,760
没错
Exactly.

640
00:41:11,930 --> 00:41:14,050
这说明了我们是怎么样的人
And what the fuck does that say about us?

641
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:17,640
你还好吗
You ok?

642
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:21,240
你说当这一切结束  会给我重创
You said when this was over it would hit me.

643
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:27,200
是的  我说过  来吧
Yeah, I did. Come on.

644
00:41:34,050 --> 00:41:36,560
-好消息吗  -DNA结果刚出来
- Good news? - Just got the DNA back -

645
00:41:36,570 --> 00:41:39,760
既成事实  与我们的所有样本都百分百匹配
effectively 100% match with all our samples.

646
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:40,680
强奸案的精液
Semen from the rapes,

647
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:43,280
哈尼斯街受害者面部的口水
saliva from the cheek of the Harness Street victim,

648
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:46,370
-科尔布里奇路的橙汁盒  -"既成事实"
- the orange juice carton at Colbridge Road... - "Effectively"?

649
00:41:46,490 --> 00:41:48,680
他们是这样措辞的
Well, they word it like this,

650
00:41:48,850 --> 00:41:51,160
"德尔罗伊·格兰特的DNA
"The DNA taken from Delroy Grant

651
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:56,040
与其他人相比  有47.5的10的24次方倍几率
"is 47.5 septillion times more likely to be linked to the DNA

652
00:41:56,050 --> 00:41:59,200
与米恩斯泰德犯相关"
"of Minstead Man than an unrelated person."

653
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:01,610
"10的24次方"  我喜欢这说法
"Septillion." I like the sound of that.

654
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:04,760
-那螺丝刀的痕迹呢  -绝对是他的  老大
- What about the screwdriver marks? - Definitely his, boss.

655
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:07,320
因为我们在搜查到DNA的两个现场看到了
As they're present at two of the scenes where we got DNA

656
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:08,880
还有其他没有DNA的现场也有
and loads of scenes where we didn't,

657
00:42:08,890 --> 00:42:11,640
这将他与其他数起案件联系在一起
it links him to literally dozens of offences.

658
00:42:11,650 --> 00:42:13,320
已经告知他这一切了吗
Has he been confronted with this?

659
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:15,440
我们开始砸证据后  他就一言不发
No commented as soon as we started rolling.

660
00:42:15,450 --> 00:42:17,240
皇家检察署给了我们时间
CPS have given us a slot.

661
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:19,480
我觉得应该尽可能多的起诉他
I say we charge him with as much as possible,

662
00:42:19,490 --> 00:42:21,410
别管什么"反正他肯定要坐牢了"
never mind "He's going down already."

663
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:25,680
我同意  我们要为尽量多的受害者伸张正义
Agreed. We get justice for as many victims as we can.

664
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:27,800
我们从严处置他吧
Let's throw the fucking book at him.

665
00:42:28,890 --> 00:42:32,490
你理解今天对你提起的这些指控吗
Do you understand the charges brought against you today?

666
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:35,800
-我理解  -你怎么辩护
- Yeah, I do. - And how do you plead?

667
00:42:36,570 --> 00:42:37,640
无罪
Not guilty.

668
00:42:39,410 --> 00:42:44,920
格兰特先生  你被起诉犯下22起罪行

和11起盗窃罪
and 11 burglaries.

673
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:57,850
尽管你拒绝认罪
Notwithstanding that you deny them,

674
00:42:58,050 --> 00:43:02,050
但在我们看来  如果被判有罪
there is, in our opinion, a very high likelihood

675
00:43:02,130 --> 00:43:08,680
你很有可能会被判很长的牢狱之刑
that, if convicted, you may well receive a long prison sentence.

676
00:43:09,130 --> 00:43:12,370
你将还押候审  待在...
You are remanded in custody to...

677
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:15,280

贝尔玛什监狱
To HMP Belmarsh.

679
00:43:37,890 --> 00:43:40,410
现在很多警察都过了退休年龄后继续工作
Plenty of officers working past retirement age now.

680
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:43,160
但人总有退休的一天
Everybody's got to go sometime, though.

681
00:43:44,850 --> 00:43:45,850
我只是说说
Just saying.

682
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:50,400
基尔伯恩的督察已经退休后继续工作五年了
DI up in Kilburn got his bus pass five years ago.

683

684
00:43:52,930 --> 00:43:54,850
前两天还破了一桩双杀案
Closed a double murder the other day.

685
00:43:58,970 --> 00:44:00,760
如果你想走  我可以收拾这里
I can finish up here if you want to get off.

686
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:02,280
不不  你回去吧

谢谢
Thanks.

690
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:14,720
你接受了我  当其他人都不怎么情愿的时候
You let me in when, er, the others weren't so inclined.

691
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:16,930
我很感激
