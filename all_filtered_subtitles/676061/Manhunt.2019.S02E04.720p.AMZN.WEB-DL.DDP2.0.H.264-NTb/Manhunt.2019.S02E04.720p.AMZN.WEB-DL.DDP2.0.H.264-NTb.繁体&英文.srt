{\an8}本片改編自1992-2009年倫敦西南
一系列強奸  性侵和搶劫的警方調查

11
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:10,680
{\an8}片中使用了部分化名
并為劇情需要而創作了一些角色和場景

12
00:00:15,530 --> 00:00:16,970
17年
'17 years.

13
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:21,080
這個人在17年間制造了無法言喻的痛苦的恐懼
'That's how long this man has inflicted untold pain and fear

14
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:23,850
強加于我們社區中最弱勢的群體
'on the most vulnerable members of our community.'

15
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:32,220
他以為自己掌控這些街道
He thinks he owns those streets.

16
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:34,900
就像他掌控他闖入的那些家
Like he owns the homes he breaks into.

17
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:38,180
出去讓他知道你們才是主人

00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:43,680
我們這里顯示的是所有在你檢測范圍周圍
'What we've got here is all the available cameras

21
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,460
可用的監控攝像頭
'on the edge of your plot.'

22
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:47,280
他昨晚犯案了
He was out last night.'

23
00:00:47,290 --> 00:00:48,540
三起盜竊
'Three burglaries.'

24
00:00:49,450 --> 00:00:51,520
他肯定還開了車
Yeah, he's got to be in a car as well.

25
00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:54,330
我賭他走了莫頓路  一路開過去
My money's on Morton Way, straight down.

26
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:56,860
{\an8}本劇由科林·薩頓和艾德·惠特摩爾構思
基于科林·薩頓的回憶錄

27
00:00:55,570 --> 00:00:57,460
這是在我們的時間范圍內
And that's the only vehicle to go down Morton Way

28
00:00:57,460 --> 00:00:58,320
唯一經過莫頓路的車
in our time frame.

29
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,640
那看起來像個小型面包車
That looks like a small people carrier to me.

30
00:01:00,650 --> 00:01:03,370
對  也許是賽飛利
Yeah, maybe a Zafira.

31
00:01:05,210 --> 00:01:07,500
差這么一點確實令人失望
'Coming so close is disappointing.

32
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:09,560
我很確定我們會有第二次機會
'I'm certain we'll get a second chance,

33
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:12,370
但前提是我們保持清醒和專注
'but only if we stay sharp and focused.'

34
00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:15,730
接線員  您需要哪種服務
Operator, which service do you require?

35
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:18,600
警察  他闖入我家了
Police... He's breaking in!

36
00:01:18,610 --> 00:01:20,200
不好意思  你是說警察嗎
I'm sorry, did you say police?

37
00:01:20,210 --> 00:01:24,140
-他在我家里  -你能藏起來嗎  茜拉
- He's in my house! - 'Is there somewhere you can hide, Sheila?'

38
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:28,200
-茜拉  怎么了  -警察就要到了
- Sheila? What's happening? - The police are coming!

39
00:01:28,210 --> 00:01:29,160
警察就要到了
The police are coming!

40
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:30,700
警察就要到了
The police are coming!

41
00:01:33,970 --> 00:01:34,730
他在那
There he is!

42
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:40,050
我們從中控臺監控
We're monitoring a CAD from LX,

Pc 1-2-6-3, chasing suspect on foot.

48
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,220
-這家伙到底是何方神圣  -他只是個凡人  科林
- Who is this bloke? - He's just a man, Colin.

49
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:06,010
一個可悲  惡劣  無藥可救的人渣
A sad, sorry, messed-up excuse for a man.

50
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:31,000
好了  請大家暫停工作  安靜
All right, settle down. Settle down.

51
00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:33,220
謝謝  老大有話要說
Thank you. The guv'nor wants a word.

52
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:39,300
在與成功失之交臂兩周后  我猜測
Two weeks after coming so close, I suspect,

53
00:02:39,850 --> 00:02:42,360
算了  我知道  因為我聽到你們聊天了
oh, sod that, I know, cos I've heard you,

54
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:43,010
{\an8}第十六晚

55
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:44,360
有些同事認為他已經再次隱匿
some of you reckon he's gone to ground

56
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:48,890
所以現在的做法是完全徹底的浪費時間
and this is just a big, expensive waste of time.

57
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:55,040
我們那次失手確實可能嚇得他更加謹慎
OK, the near-miss might've spooked him into packing up,

58
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:56,580
這點我承認
I concede that.

59
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:58,320
但我不認為他會停手
But I take a different view.

60
00:02:58,330 --> 00:03:01,760
我覺得這會讓他回到  我們知道他自認為
I think it'll drive him back into operating in the one place

61
00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:03,940
安全的地方
we know he feels safe.

62
00:03:04,010 --> 00:03:07,040
我們的關鍵線索仍然是那輛灰色賽飛利
Our key lead remains the grey Zafira

63
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:08,800
這一點你們也了然于胸
and I know you all know that

64
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,420
但請大家再從不同角度仔細看一下這輛車
but take another look at these different angles.

65
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,800
將它們刻入腦海
Imprint them on your brain,

66
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:16,730
這樣你們哪怕在遠距離
so that at a glance, or from a distance,

67
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:18,220
也能一眼鎖定它
you can clock it.

68
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,700
非常感謝大家
Thank you very much.

69
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:28,800
-34號  -謝謝  內森
- 34. - Cheers, Nath.

70
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:29,940
-給你  -謝謝  內森
- There you go. - Thanks, Nath.

71
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:33,860
-要完好的拿回來...  -你沒事吧  老大
- Bring it back in one piece... - Are you all right, guv?

72
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:36,120
你在中央3000監控系統也看到了
Well, you've seen it at Central 3000,

73
00:03:36,130 --> 00:03:37,940
午夜之后毫無動靜
after midnight nothing happens.

74
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,880
只有狐貍和一些好奇的貓
Foxes and a few inquisitive cats,

75
00:03:39,890 --> 00:03:41,240
夜里的動態也就如此而已
that's the extent of the action.

76
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:44,000
我真的很擔心他們會開始打瞌睡
I am genuinely worried they're gonna start nodding off.

77
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:46,160
-不可能  老大  -或者他們習慣了無事發生
- No way, boss. - Or they get so used to nothing happening

78
00:03:46,170 --> 00:03:47,560
而不會在有情況時候及時發現
they don't clock it when it does.

79
00:03:47,570 --> 00:03:50,610
-我覺得不可能  -怎么不可能
- Well, I just can't see that. - Why not?

80
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:53,220
第一天晚上  他就在區域內徑直開了過去
Very first night, he drove right through the plot.

81
00:03:53,570 --> 00:03:54,960
當時我們不知道他開一輛賽飛利
We didn't know he drove a Zafira then.

82
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:57,120
那晚總共才幾輛車開過  五輛嗎
How many vehicles went through that night? Five?

83
00:03:57,130 --> 00:03:58,520
他們最起碼應該看到車牌
They could've at least got a reg!

84
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:00,220
無意冒犯  長官  但這有些苛刻了
With respect, Sir, that's harsh.

85
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:02,960
監控點的位置  在漆黑的夜里
Clocking the number plate from an OP

86
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:06,300
-看清車牌并不容易  -你說的也是  內維爾
- and in the dark isn't exactly easy. - Yeah, you're right, Neville.

87
00:04:06,570 --> 00:04:09,580
我只想在他停手之前抓到他
I just want to get him before they pull the plug on us.

88
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:12,100
-你覺得能很快做到嗎  -我不知道
- You think that's imminent? - I don't know.

89
00:04:13,010 --> 00:04:13,640
跟我來
Come on.

90
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:16,340
今晚沒有我們  中央3000監控系統也不會有問題
Central 3000 will manage for one night without us.

91
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:25,810
3號監控點就位

27號監控點就位
'OP27 in position.'

95
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,360
我們沒預到會有這么高級別人來現場  長官
We weren't expecting such august company, Sir.

96
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:48,170
我們不想大肆宣揚  只想來看看你們怎么工作
Oh, well, we don't want any fuss, just want to see how it's done.

97
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:49,580
-這邊走  -謝謝
- This way. - Thank you.

98
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:54,960
其實今晚我們少一個監控員
Actually, we're down an OP tonight

99
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,810
-有你們幫忙正好  -晚上好
- it's good to have you. - Evening.

100
00:04:57,650 --> 00:04:59,800
等窗簾拉上后我們會給你們倒杯喝的
We'll bring you a cuppa for when the curtain goes up.

101
00:04:59,810 --> 00:05:01,220
非常感謝
Much appreciated.

102
00:05:02,810 --> 00:05:04,460
如果你們能接管這里
If you can handle things here,

103
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:06,930
我們就去下一條街那邊的偵查屋
we'll be in a scout hut down the next street.

104
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:19,900
別擔心  我們不會在執勤時睡著的
Don't worry, we're not sleeping on the job.

105
00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:22,980
午夜過后這里會非常冷
After midnight it gets colder than a witch's tit in here.

106
00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:26,900
17號監控點就...
'OP17 in...'

107
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:29,730
-20號監控點就位  -收到
- 'OP20 in position.' - Received.

108
00:05:58,330 --> 00:05:59,540
{\an8}U2著名愛爾蘭搖滾樂隊

109
00:05:58,330 --> 00:05:59,540
你知道U2嗎
Do you know U2?

110
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:04,020
-那個樂隊嗎  -對
- What, the band? - Yeah.

111
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:06,580
我當然知道  你以為我有多老
Yeah, course I do. How old d'you think I am?

112
00:06:08,890 --> 00:06:10,900
我小時候超級喜歡他們
I was massively into them as a kid.

113
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:15,220
我去過他們在溫布利舉辦的《約書亞之樹》巡演
I saw them at Wembley on The Joshua Tree tour.

114
00:06:15,450 --> 00:06:19,490
那張專輯很棒  我應該有一張黑膠版
That's a good album. I got it on vinyl somewhere.

115
00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:21,840
好吧  那你一定知道《射向藍天》這首歌了
Right, so, you know the song, Bullet The Blue Sky?

116
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:27,460
-對  -我有件T恤上印著這歌的歌詞
- Yeah. - Well, I had this t-shirt with the lyrics printed on it.

117
00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:29,610
就是"我看不到那些戰斗機"那句
You know, "I can see those fighter planes,"

118
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,860
下面印的是一個怒吼女士的圖
over a picture of a woman screaming.

119
00:06:32,690 --> 00:06:35,100
我非常喜歡那件衣服
I was dead pleased with it.

120
00:06:35,890 --> 00:06:37,880
很嚴肅  很有政治意義
You know, it was serious, political.

121
00:06:37,890 --> 00:06:40,400
是啊  好過"弗蘭基說請放松"
Yeah. Not "Frankie says relax".

122
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,780
對  也好過"選擇生活"
Right. Not "Choose life".

123
00:06:44,450 --> 00:06:46,580
但只要我穿那件衣服  我媽媽就會說
But whenever I wore it my mum would go,

124
00:06:47,130 --> 00:06:49,490
"現在你能看到那些戰斗機了嗎  小內"
"Can you see those fighter planes yet, Nev?"

125
00:06:51,690 --> 00:06:53,370
媽媽們就這樣
That's mums for you, you know.

126
00:06:58,330 --> 00:06:59,900
你怎么想起這個了
What made you think of that?

127
00:07:03,810 --> 00:07:04,660
我不知道
Dunno.

128
00:07:06,130 --> 00:07:06,810
就...
Just...

129
00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:12,170
我確實沒見過一架戰斗機  所以也許...
I never did see any fighter planes, so maybe...

130
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:15,700
你現在也有那種感覺  對嗎
You got that feeling now, have you?

131
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:21,300
對  我就那種感覺  老大
Yeah. Yeah, I do, guv.

132
00:07:21,890 --> 00:07:22,660
我是說...
I mean...

133
00:07:24,810 --> 00:07:29,900
...如果這樣不起作用  那...之后怎么辦
..if this doesn't work, then... what then?

134
00:07:34,130 --> 00:07:35,460
聽我說
I tell you what.

135
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:40,260
只要他出現  我們就能抓到他
When he does show up, we've got him.

136
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:43,160
他只要踏入監控范圍
He sets one foot on the plot

137
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:45,100
就會被被立刻...
and he'll stick out like a fucking...

138
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,800
所有人員  所有人員注意  6號監控點報告
All units, all units, from OP6, be aware.

139
00:07:52,810 --> 00:07:56,440
有一名男性  徒步從拉維妮婭花園走向莫頓大道
We have a male on foot, Lavinia Gardens towards Morton Avenue.

140
00:07:56,450 --> 00:07:59,490
深色帽衫套頭  暫無更多描述  請待命
Dark hoody worn up, no better description, stand by.

141
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:05,660
他走進了拉維妮婭花園6號的私人車道
He's entering the driveway of number six Lavinia Gardens.

142
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:11,730
4號監控點  4號監控點  是否收到
OP4. OP4. Did you receive?

143
00:08:12,690 --> 00:08:14,020
4號監控點收到
'OP4. Received.'

144
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:19,100
待命  待命  他已經走到房子門前
Stand by, stand by. He's down the side of a house.

145
00:08:20,170 --> 00:08:22,820
行動組待命  隨時準備行動
'Mobiles standing by and ready to deploy.'

146
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:25,460
我們可以看他怎么動手
We could be watching him work.

147
00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:28,980
別動手  我重復  不要動手  所有人待命
Negative, I repeat, negative, all units are to stand by.

148
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:31,300
可惡  那是什么  手電筒嗎
Shit. What's that, a torch?

149
00:08:32,890 --> 00:08:35,380
-要行動嗎  老大  -不
- Should we make a move, guv? - No.

150
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:38,260
不行  如果偽裝暴露  也就毀掉了整個行動
No, if we blow our cover, then we've blown the op.

151
00:08:38,850 --> 00:08:40,540
再等一下  直到確定就是他
Just wait till we're sure it's him.

152
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:01,000
警報解除  警報解除
Stand down, stand down,

153
00:09:01,010 --> 00:09:03,040
只是一個年輕白人男性回家休息
it's a young white male going home to bed.

154
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:05,780
-他可真幸福  -6號監控點結束
- 'Lucky bastard.' - OP6 out.

155
00:09:06,130 --> 00:09:07,860
行動組撤退
'Mobiles standing down.'

156
00:09:25,850 --> 00:09:26,740
你沒事吧
You ok?

157
00:09:28,130 --> 00:09:30,420
累得我渾身僵硬
I'm stiff as a board!

158
00:09:30,890 --> 00:09:33,260
真不知道他們怎么每晚堅持下來的
I don't know how they do it night after night.

159
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,980
首先  他們白天會睡覺
They sleep in the day, for one.

160
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,380
你就不能晚點去上班嗎
Can't you go in later?

161
00:09:40,450 --> 00:09:42,440
我要參加一個健康安全匯報會
I've got a Health and Safety briefing.

162
00:09:42,450 --> 00:09:45,000
之前兩場我都缺席  上面提醒我
I missed the last two and it's been suggested from above

163
00:09:45,010 --> 00:09:46,480
我最好關注這個方面
that I might want to start taking an interest.

164
00:09:46,490 --> 00:09:50,160
-否則呢  -我不會讓他們有借口搶走我的任務
- Or what? - I'm not giving them any excuse to take my toys away.

165
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,120
你要是在M25公路上身亡
Well, you get killed on the M25,

166
00:09:52,130 --> 00:09:54,660
他們就是要去參加健康安全匯報會的人了
they'll be the ones who need Health and Safety.

167
00:09:56,090 --> 00:09:58,520
特派代表著領導力強而有力
You know, delegation's a hallmark of strong,

168
00:09:58,520 --> 00:09:59,930
-而不是軟弱無能  -路易絲
- not weak, leadership. - Louise..

169
00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:01,760
你這是把自己往絕路上逼
You're running yourself into the ground.

170
00:10:01,770 --> 00:10:03,380
因為內森不在
Cos Nathan's away.

171
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:06,080
想在你的工作和生活間
It's possible to care about your job

172
00:10:06,090 --> 00:10:09,050
找到...怎么說  平衡  還是有可能的
and find... I don't know, balance.

173
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:13,520
-但我不行  -你認真試過嗎
- Not for me. - How hard have you looked?

174
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:16,120
我就是這樣的人  一旦投入  不計安危
That's the way I am, in for a penny, in for a pound.

175
00:10:16,130 --> 00:10:19,690
我羨慕那些能把工作就留在工作場所的人
I envy people who can leave their work at work.

176
00:10:19,890 --> 00:10:21,260
不  你才不羨慕
No, you don't.

177
00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:22,810
你要遲到了
You're gonna be late.

178
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,140
確實
Yes, I am.

179
00:10:34,090 --> 00:10:36,380
只是  過去這幾周觀察你...
It's watching you these last weeks...

180
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:43,900
我知道一直很壓抑  緊張  殫精竭慮...
I know it's been frustrating, nerve-wracking, exhausting...

181
00:10:44,450 --> 00:10:46,420
但我不太確定...
I'm just not sure...

182
00:10:48,010 --> 00:10:53,260
我不確定...是只因為要抓住這個人嗎
I'm just not sure... it's just about catching this man.

183
00:10:53,450 --> 00:10:54,500
什么意思
What d'you mean?

184
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,720
我覺得你這么投入這個案子
I think you're going at it this hard

185
00:10:58,730 --> 00:11:00,540
是因為你知道這是最后一次...
because you know it's the last time...

186
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:07,210
...而這個事實讓你前所未有的害怕
..and you're dreading that more than anything.

187
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:09,840
就看看你自己
I mean, just look at you.

188
00:11:09,850 --> 00:11:11,520
你整晚在外挨凍
You're out all night in the cold

189
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:14,210
今早還準備正常上班
and straight back in this morning.

190
00:11:15,730 --> 00:11:18,280
你什么都不想錯過  也不愿浪費時間睡覺
You don't want to miss a thing, or waste time sleeping,

191
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:22,620
因為你知道退休后心里會有多空虛
cos you know how big a hole that's gonna leave.

192
00:11:23,970 --> 00:11:28,740
我也不怪你  我怎么會怪你呢
And I don't blame you. How could I?

193
00:11:29,010 --> 00:11:31,540
這是你最熟悉的事情  你就是這樣的人
You're in your element, it's just who you are.

194
00:11:32,090 --> 00:11:35,720
我只希望當這些都結束  當你退休...
I just hope when it's over, when you're done...

195
00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:40,540
我們現有的生活能令你滿足  我能令你滿足
that what we have is enough. That I'm enough.

196
00:11:45,730 --> 00:11:49,740
你也能滿足于酒吧小游戲和花園中心
And you can make your peace with pub quizzes and garden centres.

197
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,760
前半句沒問題  后半句不行
Yes to the former, no to the latter.

198
00:11:51,770 --> 00:11:52,920
好吧  你又要拿這事取笑了
Oh, go on, make a joke of it.

199
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:55,420
-除非被脅迫或者假裝可以  -科林
- Unless under duress or in disguise. - Colin.

200
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:00,980
你說得對
You're right.

201
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:03,380
我很害怕接下來要發生什么
I am scared about what's next.

202
00:12:03,770 --> 00:12:07,140
我只知道工作  說真的
The job's all I know and, to be honest,

203
00:12:07,610 --> 00:12:09,930
我都不敢想象退休后是什么樣
I can't even imagine what it's gonna be like.

204
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:19,780
-好了  我得走了  -但我們會沒事  對嗎
- Right, I'd better go. - We'll be all right, though?

205
00:12:22,330 --> 00:12:23,620
希望如此
I hope so.

206
00:12:36,010 --> 00:12:37,320
我們都準備好了
We are all set.

207
00:12:37,330 --> 00:12:39,840
監控點隨時會報告就位
Observation points will be radioing in any minute.

208
00:12:39,850 --> 00:12:40,860
謝謝  米歇爾
Cheers, Michelle.

209
00:12:46,370 --> 00:12:49,330
{\an8}第十七晚

210
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:52,720
你們好  他們提前一天放了我們
All right? They let us go a day early.

211
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:55,400
真的嗎  為什么  表現好的獎勵嗎
Oh, yeah? What's that, time off for good behaviour?

212
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,660
差不多是這意思  對
Something like that, yeah.

213
00:12:57,090 --> 00:12:59,480
-怎么樣  -還行
- How was it? - Yeah, fine.

214
00:12:59,490 --> 00:13:02,280
但是  你忙了好一陣了
But, erm, you've had a bit of a time of it,

215
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:05,020
所以我現在放你去休息
so I'm relieving you as of now.

216
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,800
不用  好意我心領了  但是我已經來了...
Oh, no, I appreciate the thought but I'm here now...

217
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:10,720
我支持他的決定  拜托就趕緊離開
I second that. Do us all a favour and bugger off.

218
00:13:10,730 --> 00:13:12,690
-要來杯咖啡嗎  -好  麻煩你了
- Do you want a coffee? - Yeah, please.

219
00:13:12,730 --> 00:13:14,380
明天也休息吧
Take tomorrow off, too.

220
00:13:15,090 --> 00:13:16,570
是周末了  老大
It's the weekend, guv.

221
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:25,080
好  行  好吧  那謝謝
Ok. All right. Yeah. OK, cheers.

222
00:13:25,090 --> 00:13:26,280
有什么我需要知道的事嗎
Anything I should know?

223
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:28,720
怎么說呢  盡管希望越來越渺茫
Er, well, in the increasingly unlikely event

224
00:13:28,730 --> 00:13:30,720
我們似乎都已經沒有犯人可阻止了...
that we should actually need to stop someone...

225
00:13:30,730 --> 00:13:33,360
科林·薩頓  大失所望嗎  我可不相信
Colin Sutton, disillusioned? I don't believe it.

226
00:13:33,370 --> 00:13:35,000
我們一定要注意
It is essential that we do it

227
00:13:35,010 --> 00:13:37,500
逮捕地離監控區域越遠越好
as far away from the plot as possible.

228
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:38,200
好吧
Ok...?

229
00:13:38,210 --> 00:13:39,480
這樣就算嫌疑人被排除
So that if they are ruled out they

230
00:13:39,490 --> 00:13:41,260
他們也不會知道自己是在哪被盯上的
won't know where they were stopped.

231
00:13:41,730 --> 00:13:44,980
這樣暴露行動和行動地點的可能就會降低
Less chance of the op and its location leaking?

232
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:48,000
你能回來真的太好了  內森
Nice to have you back, Nathan.

233
00:13:48,010 --> 00:13:50,040
謝謝你  謝謝
Thank you. Thank you.

234
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:50,810
晚安
Good night

235
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:18,100
九點鐘方向
Nine o'clock.

236
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:23,450
那是輛賽飛利嗎  就在雪鐵龍后面
That's a Zafira, right? Behind that red Citroen.

237
00:14:26,970 --> 00:14:28,860
對  那是一輛賽飛利
Yeah, that's a Zafira.

238
00:14:29,010 --> 00:14:31,660
小改款  顏色也符合
Facelifted model and the colour's right, too.

239
00:14:32,010 --> 00:14:33,200
而且過去兩周
And it wasn't parked there

240
00:14:33,210 --> 00:14:35,620
該車沒停在那里或附近任何街道上
or any of the surrounding streets in the last fortnight.

241
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:39,300
馬上報告
Call it in.

242
00:14:40,650 --> 00:14:42,680
控制中心  控制中心  6號監控點報告
Control, Control from OP6,

243
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:44,300
我能通報一下嗎
can I give a circulation?

244
00:14:46,450 --> 00:14:47,570
說吧  6號監控點報告
'Go ahead, Six.'

245
00:14:48,490 --> 00:14:50,080
我們發現了輛灰色賽飛利
We have a grey Zafira

246
00:14:50,090 --> 00:14:53,560
朝東停在我們哨點對面的拉維妮婭花園
parked opposite our OP on Lavinia Gardens, facing east.

247
00:14:53,570 --> 00:14:54,800
我們之前從未見過這輛車
We haven't seen it before.

248
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:57,400
車的顏色和年代都很符合
It's of the right colour and age to be of interest,

249
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:59,240
所以請各部門記住這一點
so can all units please bear this in mind

250
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:01,240
以防我們隨后通報該車動向
in case we put it up as moving later?

251
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:04,480
收到  6號監控點  全體注意  全體注意
All received, OP6. All units, all units, please be aware

252
00:15:04,490 --> 00:15:06,120
有輛灰色沃克斯豪爾賽飛利
there is a grey Vauxhall Zafira

253
00:15:06,130 --> 00:15:09,020
朝東停在拉維妮婭花園
stationary on Lavinia Gardens, facing east.

254
00:15:09,090 --> 00:15:10,800
該車之前從未出現過
It has not been seen previously

255
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:13,520
如有任何動作  6號監控點會更新消息
and OP6 will update if there is any movement.

256
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:14,930
控制中心下線
Control out.

257
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:18,020
一點車牌都看不到嗎
Not even a partial on the reg?

258
00:15:18,490 --> 00:15:20,500
抱歉  視線完全被擋住了
'Sorry, totally blocked from view.'

259
00:15:21,370 --> 00:15:24,300
可以讓人去現場看看嗎
Someone could stretch their legs, get it that way?

OK, Delroy, well, if you can stay where you are for me,

388
00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:48,970
我的同事要檢查一下你的后備箱
my colleague's gonna take a look in your boot.

389
00:23:48,970 --> 00:23:51,620
-是開著的嗎  -開著
- Is it open? - Yeah, it's open.

390
00:23:54,010 --> 00:23:56,700
-你是做什么工作的  德爾羅伊  -我是護工
- What d'you do for work, Delroy? - I'm a carer.

391
00:23:58,660 --> 00:24:00,380
是嘛  挺好
Oh, right. OK.

392
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:02,790
這么晚你出來干什么
And what are you doing out this late?

393
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:07,060
我在合作社外面等著想買些煙
I was waiting outside the Co-op to buy some puff,

394
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:09,480
可那家伙一直沒露面
but the guy never showed.

395
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:11,140
亞當
Adam.

396
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:17,100
請你走出車來  德爾羅伊
Would you like to step out of the vehicle, please, Delroy?

397
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:22,250
德爾羅伊·格蘭特  我以涉嫌
Delroy Grant, I am arresting you

398
00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:26,060
強奸  入室盜竊和猥褻罪逮捕你
on suspicion of rape, burglary and indecent assault.

399
00:24:26,060 --> 00:24:28,300
你有權保持沉默  但詢問過程中
You do not have to say anything, but it may harm your defence

400
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:30,380
你避而不談的問題都將在后續的庭審中
if you do not mention when questioned

401
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:32,620
可能會成為對你不利的證據
something which you later rely on in court.

402
00:24:51,770 --> 00:24:52,580
科林·薩頓
Colin Sutton.

403
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:55,180
科林  我是內森  看起來我們抓住他了
'Colin, it's Nathan. Looks like we've got him.'

404
00:24:55,180 --> 00:24:57,820
操  你逗我吧
Fuck. You're joking?

405
00:24:58,490 --> 00:25:00,380
你真覺得我會在凌晨三點
Do you really think I'd joke about something like that

406
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:01,730
開這樣的玩笑嗎
at three in the morning?

407
00:25:01,730 --> 00:25:04,340
我想不會  你確定是他嗎
'No, I suppose not. Are you sure it's him?'

408
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:06,250
這么說吧
Well, put it this way,

409
00:25:06,250 --> 00:25:09,620
我們從他銀灰色的賽飛利上起獲了
we recovered his grey top with black stripes

410
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:12,100
他那件有黑色條紋的灰色上衣
from his silver-grey facelifted Zafira.

411
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:14,450
-科爾布里奇路的那段監控嗎  -完全吻合
- The Colbridge Road footage? - 'Perfect match,

412
00:25:14,450 --> 00:25:17,100
加上他后備箱里有根撬棒和一把螺絲刀
'plus he had a crowbar and a screwdriver in the boot.

413
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:17,860
雖然為時尚早
'It's early days,

414
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:21,580
但我認為那些撬痕正是后者弄出來的
'but I'd say the latter probably made all those pry marks.'

415
00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:23,970
我的天  他叫什么
Bloody hell! What's his name?

416
00:25:24,250 --> 00:25:26,970
德爾羅伊·伊斯頓·格蘭特
Delroy Easton Grant.

417
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:31,140
從指揮延續性的角度
From a continuity of command angle,

418
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:34,060
或許由我繼續指揮到早上會更合理一些...
it probably makes sense for me to carry it on till morning...

419
00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:37,450
很高興那個高級調查官的課程沒有白上
Good to see that SIO course wasn't wasted.

420
00:25:37,450 --> 00:25:40,730
是啊  沒想到這么快我就用上了
'Yeah, didn't think I'd put it to use quite so soon.'

421
00:25:40,730 --> 00:25:43,490
干得漂亮  內森  干得漂亮
This is great work, Nathan, it's great work.

422
00:25:43,490 --> 00:25:45,900
請你替我轉達給大家吧
Please pass that onto the others for me, will you?

423
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:47,580
嗯  我會的
Yeah. Will do.

424
00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:51,220
-我們八點見  -嗯  回頭見
- I'll see you at eight. - 'Yeah. See you then.'

425
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:05,860
你和誰講這么久
Who are you kidding?

426
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:09,290
我們抓住他了
We got him.

427
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:15,770
我去把水燒上
I'll put the kettle on.

428
00:26:44,290 --> 00:26:45,890
-西蒙·摩根  -我是科林·薩頓
- 'Simon Morgan.' - It's Colin Sutton.

429
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:47,620
抱歉這么早給你打電話
I'm sorry to call you so early,

430
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:49,810
但我想親自告訴你
but I wanted you to hear it from me,

431
00:26:49,810 --> 00:26:51,140
看起來我們抓住他了
it looks like we've got him.

432
00:26:53,740 --> 00:26:54,620
西蒙
Simon?

433
00:26:54,740 --> 00:26:57,610
嗯  我還在  老天
'Yeah, I'm still here. Fucking hell.'

434
00:26:57,620 --> 00:26:59,010
對  我也是這么說的
Yeah, that's what I said.

435
00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:01,730
我們位于拉維妮婭花園的一個監控點發現...
One of our OPs on Lavinia Gardens saw...

436
00:27:01,730 --> 00:27:02,490
我這就過來
'I'm on my way in.'

437
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:05,580
好  等你到了我把情況告訴你
OK, I'll fill you in when you get here.

438
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:21,970
這位我們老大  薩頓先生
This is the boss, Mr Sutton.

439
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:26,290
你好  長官
Hello, sir.

440
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:29,770
真是幸會啊
I'm so pleased to meet you.

441
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:34,900
你是要擊球還是投球啊
So what are you, batting or bowling?

442
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:39,650
你不太喜歡板球吧  長官
You're not into cricket, are you, sir?

443
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:42,410
-喜歡啊  -但你還是不打吧
- Yeah. - But you still don't play?

444
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:45,170
實際上我打  偶爾打  你呢
I do, as a matter of fact, yeah, occasionally. You?

445
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:47,530
打  我當然打了  擊球和投球
Yes, yes, of course I do. Bat and bowl.

446
00:27:47,530 --> 00:27:50,210
那真不錯啊  我的膝蓋不允許我投球了
Oh, good for you. My knees won't let me bowl,

447
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:53,220
但我還能像以往一樣地揮棒
but I can still swing a bat around as well as I ever could.

448
00:27:54,010 --> 00:27:54,940
告訴我  長官
Well, tell me, sir,

449
00:27:55,530 --> 00:27:58,140
你覺得英格蘭在南非的機會怎么樣
what do you think of England's chances in South Africa?

450
00:27:59,140 --> 00:28:01,570
我認為我們可以再加一名快投手
I think we could do with one more fast bowler

451
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:03,330
但是我覺得我們有很大的機會
but, er, I think we've got a great chance.

452
00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:05,220
沒錯  我一直也這么說
Yeah, man, that's what I've been saying!

453
00:28:11,010 --> 00:28:12,570
長官  得告訴你一下
Just so you're aware, sir,

454
00:28:12,580 --> 00:28:15,810
我妻子患了多發性硬化癥  我是她主要的護工
my wife suffers from MS and I'm her primary carer.

455
00:28:15,810 --> 00:28:17,860
很明顯  這會讓她受驚
Obviously, this'll come as a shock to her.

456
00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:20,660
我想會吧
Yeah, I imagine it will.

457
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:24,970
我只想確保她會受到照顧
Well, I just want to make sure she's properly taken care of.

458
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:28,700
-否則我會很擔心  -抱歉打斷一下
- I'll be worried otherwise. - Sorry to interrupt.

459
00:28:28,770 --> 00:28:32,060
格蘭特先生  請您簽署一下DNA取樣好嗎
Mr Grant, could I have your signature for the DNA sample?

460
00:28:43,650 --> 00:28:45,100
現在去錄指紋吧
Prints now, please.

461
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:49,140
這邊
This way.

462
00:28:58,460 --> 00:29:02,450
-還用老式的方法呢  -對  還是濕定型好用
- Still doing 'em old school? - Oh, yeah. Can't beat a wet set.

463
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:04,010
請把右手給我
I need your right hand, please.

464
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:33,970
不明白你為什么要費這個勁
Don't know why you're bothering,

465
00:29:35,290 --> 00:29:37,100
你們知道我總是戴著手套
you know I always wore gloves.

466
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:49,770
剛剛你說了句很有意思的話啊
That was an interesting comment you made just now

467
00:29:49,770 --> 00:29:51,460
關于總是戴著手套的那句話
about always wearing gloves.

468
00:29:51,980 --> 00:29:53,300
我們能取一個你的簽名嗎
Er, could we get a signature off you,

469
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:54,850
只是確認你說了那句話
just to confirm you made it?

470
00:30:00,530 --> 00:30:01,560
你今晚是否接觸過
Have you had any contact

471
00:30:01,570 --> 00:30:04,810
任何體弱或年長的人  德爾羅伊
with a vulnerable or an elderly person tonight, Delroy?

472
00:30:07,650 --> 00:30:10,000
沒有一個屁股摔壞了
There's no-one out there with a broken hip

473
00:30:10,010 --> 00:30:11,440
無法拿到電話的人嗎
who can't get to the phone?

474
00:30:12,250 --> 00:30:14,370
沒人需要幫助和注意嗎
No-one in need of help and attention?

475
00:30:16,330 --> 00:30:19,010
我今晚沒見任何人
I haven't visited anyone tonight.

476
00:30:22,610 --> 00:30:23,800
如果你有什么不明白
Very important that you ask

477
00:30:23,810 --> 00:30:27,200
請務必問清楚  德爾羅伊  好嗎
if there's anything you don't understand, Delroy. OK?

478
00:30:28,370 --> 00:30:32,640
-天吶  天吶  天吶  -怎么了  德爾羅伊
- Oh, dear, oh, dear, oh, dear. - What is it, Delroy?

479
00:30:36,290 --> 00:30:38,680
你們最好去調查一下我兒子
You really want to have a look at my son.

480
00:30:39,650 --> 00:30:40,680
你兒子
Your son?

481
00:30:40,810 --> 00:30:44,810
這對我來說很難...非常難
This is hard for me... so hard...

482
00:30:46,770 --> 00:30:48,960
但鑒于這些罪名的嚴重性
..but given the seriousness of the offences,

483
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:51,330
我希望你們能抓對人
I want to make sure you get the right man.

484
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:56,530
他的DNA會跟我的一樣  或很類似
His DNA's gonna be the same as mine, or very similar,

485
00:30:56,680 --> 00:31:00,680
外加我們身高一致  而且他住在附近
plus we're the same height, and he lives in the area.

486
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:07,440
你為什么直到現在才告訴我  德爾羅伊
Why did you wait until now to tell us this, Delroy?

487
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:12,850
我依然處于受驚狀態
I'm still in a state of shock.

488
00:31:14,090 --> 00:31:16,000
-胡扯  -對  當然是胡扯
- Bullshit. - Yeah, course it's bullshit.

489
00:31:16,010 --> 00:31:18,200
雙胞胎的DNA一樣  但父子不可能
Twins can share DNA, but not fathers and sons.

490
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:20,160
但他說得對  仍然可能很相似
He's right, though, they can be very similar.

491
00:31:20,290 --> 00:31:22,360
-我們需要查這個嗎  -對  我們得打幾個電話
- We need to jump on this? - Yeah, we need to make some calls.

492
00:31:22,370 --> 00:31:24,920
讓帕特麗夏去查兒子  然后我們取樣
Get Patricia to look the son up and we can get a sample.

493
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:27,530
-好  立刻去辦  老大  -并告訴她我一起去
- Yeah. Will do, boss. - And tell her I want to be there.

494
00:31:37,330 --> 00:31:38,330
你可沒閑著
You didn't hang about.

495
00:31:38,890 --> 00:31:40,760
-我們確定是他嗎  -我想是的
- We're sure it's him? - Yeah, I think so.

496
00:31:40,770 --> 00:31:43,570
-DNA會確認  -他在系統里嗎
- The DNA will confirm. - Was he in the system?

497
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:47,160
還不知道  我直接來了這里  恭喜
TBC - I came straight here. Congratulations.

498
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:49,280
你的大日子  你的案子破了
Your day, your case,

499
00:31:49,290 --> 00:31:52,130
-我只是幫忙跨過了終點線  -謝謝
- I just helped it over the finish line. - Thank you.

500
00:31:53,330 --> 00:31:55,280
-我去看看團隊  -好  我也去
- I'll go check on the team. - Yeah, I'll join you.

501
00:31:55,290 --> 00:31:58,010
-我只想看看他的臉  -當然
- I just wanna see his face. - Sure, yeah.

502
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:32,730
好吧  所以他在系統里嗎
OK, was he in the system or not?

503
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:36,970
-很復雜  -他沒開玩笑
- It's complicated. - He's not kidding.

504
00:32:37,090 --> 00:32:39,240
聽完他們解釋后我不得不去躺會
I had to go and have a lie down when they explained it.

505
00:32:39,250 --> 00:32:42,530
-只有你這樣  肯尼  -說吧  內森
- That's just you, Kenny. - Go on, Nath.

506
00:32:44,490 --> 00:32:48,090
99年在布羅姆利有一起盜竊
There's a burglary, back in '99 in Bromley.

507
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:50,320
地方警察通知了米恩斯泰德團隊
Local police inform the Minstead team,

508
00:32:50,330 --> 00:32:53,090
但他們認為不是米恩斯泰德犯
but they don't think it's Minstead Man.

509
00:32:53,130 --> 00:32:55,210
-不符合標準嗎  -對
- Didn't fit the criteria? - No.

510
00:32:55,250 --> 00:32:57,120
所以布羅姆利就自己調查了
So Bromley go ahead and investigate.

511
00:32:57,130 --> 00:32:59,840
受害者有一個鄰居看到一輛車
Now a neighbour of the victim sees a car

512
00:32:59,850 --> 00:33:01,680
她覺得有些可疑
that she thinks looks suspicious

513
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:03,160
于是就上報了車牌
and she reports the number.

514
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:06,160
他們一查發現登記在德爾羅伊·格蘭特名字
They run a trace and it's registered to a Delroy Grant

515
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:08,160
地址是森林山
at an address in Forest Hill.

516
00:33:08,650 --> 00:33:10,370
他們把他名字輸入全國警察數據庫
They put his name in the PNC.

517
00:33:11,090 --> 00:33:13,290
結果發現有六個名字一樣的人
It IDs six people of that name.

518
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:17,490
一個在哈克尼  有盜竊犯罪史  也登記了DNA
One in Hackney, had a burglary conviction. DNA on file.

519
00:33:19,650 --> 00:33:22,370
好  那這份樣本和我們的犯罪現場樣本呢
Right. And this sample was compared to our scenes?

520
00:33:23,370 --> 00:33:25,290
他們通知我們說哈克尼的德爾羅伊
They informed us that Hackney Delroy

521
00:33:25,290 --> 00:33:26,370
不是米恩斯泰德犯
wasn't Minstead Man.

522
00:33:27,530 --> 00:33:30,520
-聽著很簡單  -對  只不過不知為何那份結果
- Sounds straightforward. - Yeah, except somehow that result

523
00:33:30,530 --> 00:33:33,480
被登記到了森林山的德爾羅伊檔案名下
became assigned to Forest Hill Delroy's profile

524
00:33:33,490 --> 00:33:35,960
并在我們的系統里建檔了
and a nominal was created on our system.

525
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:37,640
他們的錯誤成了我們的錯誤
Their mistake became our mistake?

526
00:33:37,650 --> 00:33:40,050
對  而且還沒完
Yeah. And it gets worse.

527
00:33:41,050 --> 00:33:44,080
我們隊里有個警員在去找森林山的德爾羅伊
A DC from our team went to visit Forest Hill Delroy

528
00:33:44,090 --> 00:33:46,730
調查他盜竊案當晚的行蹤
to check his movements on the night of the burglary.

529
00:33:49,330 --> 00:33:50,330
嗯  然后呢
Yeah, and...?

530
00:33:51,890 --> 00:33:55,010
他沒在家  結果也沒再繼續跟進了
He was out and it was never followed up.

531
00:33:55,850 --> 00:33:58,290
-那就是我們抓的德爾羅伊嗎  -對
- And that's the Delroy we just nicked? - Yeah.

532
00:34:00,090 --> 00:34:01,210
轉到右側
Turn to your right.

533
00:34:03,490 --> 00:34:04,640
如果采樣了他的DNA
If his DNA had been taken,

534
00:34:04,650 --> 00:34:07,330
立馬就能鑒定出他是米恩斯泰德犯
he would have instantly been identified as Minstead Man.

535
00:34:08,890 --> 00:34:09,800
天吶
Christ...

536
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:13,530
從那刻起  德爾羅伊·格蘭特這個人就被排除了
From that moment on, the name Delroy Grant was ruled out.

537
00:34:14,450 --> 00:34:15,570
轉向左側
Turn to your left.

538
00:34:19,930 --> 00:34:21,520
他也沒在取樣名單上嗎
And he wasn't on the swabbing list?

539
00:34:21,530 --> 00:34:24,320
對  因為之前因DNA錯誤被排除了
No, been formally eliminated by DNA.

540
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:27,450
-所以就算用DNA取樣法你們也抓不住他  -對
- So you'd never have got him that way anyway? - No.

541
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:30,600
在2001年  德爾羅伊·格蘭特這個名字又出現
In 2001, the name Delroy Grant cropped up again

542
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:33,880
當時有人撥打熱線  說他是嫌犯
when someone called the hotline pushing him as a suspect.

543
00:34:33,890 --> 00:34:36,400
那是在《犯罪調查》節目播出后
It was after one of those Crimewatch appeals.

544
00:34:36,410 --> 00:34:37,680
但沒有采取任何行動
And the action got binned

545
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:40,490
因為犯罪數據庫說他測了DNA  被排除了
because HOLMES said he'd been cleared by DNA.

546
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:42,890
十年前
Ten years ago.

547
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:45,850
十年
A decade.

548
00:34:48,490 --> 00:34:50,130
自那以后有多少受害者
How many victims since then?

549
00:35:12,570 --> 00:35:14,090
小德爾羅伊·格蘭特
'Delroy Grant Jr?'

550
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:16,090
請進
Come in.

551
00:35:23,650 --> 00:35:25,600
有人跟你一起住這里嗎  德爾羅伊
Does, er, anyone live here with you, Delroy?

552
00:35:25,610 --> 00:35:29,320
我媽和我哥  什么事
My mum and my brother. What's this about?

553
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:32,320
你沒惹麻煩  也沒有人去世  不是這類事
You're not in any trouble. No-one's died, it's nothing like that.

554
00:35:33,010 --> 00:35:36,450
但我們有些不太好開口的消息要告訴你
But we do have some difficult news to share with you.

555
00:35:37,530 --> 00:35:38,370
好
Ok...

556
00:35:39,970 --> 00:35:41,570
聽著  能坐下嗎
Look, can we sit down?

557
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:52,970
你聽說過黑夜狩獵者的案子嗎  德爾羅伊
Are you familiar with the Night Stalker case, Delroy?

558
00:35:53,890 --> 00:35:56,410
-聽說過  襲擊老婦人的家伙  -對
- Yeah, the bloke attacking old ladies? - That's right.

559
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:59,570
新聞上說你們逮捕了一個人
Said on the news you arrested someone.

560
00:36:00,010 --> 00:36:02,090
是的  沒錯
We have, that's correct.

561
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:05,080
我很遺憾地通知你
I'm very sorry to tell you that

562
00:36:05,090 --> 00:36:08,320
被逮捕的人是你父親  德爾羅伊·伊斯頓·格蘭特
that man is your father, Delroy Easton Grant.

563
00:36:10,450 --> 00:36:11,370
不
No.

564
00:36:15,530 --> 00:36:17,050
不可能  絕對不是
No way. It can't be.

565
00:36:18,970 --> 00:36:19,890
你們
How...

566
00:36:22,050 --> 00:36:23,370
你們有多確認
How sure are you?

567
00:36:24,010 --> 00:36:26,480
我們還沒有百分百的確認
Well, we don't have absolute confirmation yet,

568
00:36:26,490 --> 00:36:28,970
但如果沒有極大把握  我們也不會來這里
but we wouldn't be here unless we were very sure.

569
00:36:29,970 --> 00:36:31,570
你跟你父親多久見一次
How often do you see your dad?

570
00:36:32,490 --> 00:36:33,610
偶爾吧
Now and then.

571
00:36:35,050 --> 00:36:37,680
我們有很長一段時間與他沒有來往
For a long time we had nothing to do with him.

572
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:39,050
"我們"
"We"?

573
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:42,090
我  我媽  我哥
Me, Mum, my brother...

574
00:36:42,130 --> 00:36:43,240
為什么
Why was that?

575
00:36:43,850 --> 00:36:47,760
他在我還是小嬰兒時棄我們而去  我想是兩歲
Well, he walked out when I was a toddler. Two, I think.

576
00:37:11,890 --> 00:37:12,680
對
Yeah.

577
00:37:14,450 --> 00:37:16,530
直到我8還是9歲才再次見到他
Didn't see him again till I was eight or nine.

578
00:37:20,450 --> 00:37:21,920
有一天突然出現在學校門外
Turned up at the school gates one day

579
00:37:21,930 --> 00:37:24,850
答應要周末帶我和我哥去游泳
and promised to take me and my brother swimming at the weekend.

580
00:37:26,890 --> 00:37:29,840
媽媽不太樂意  但她看我們這么期待
Mum wasn't keen, but she saw how excited we were

581
00:37:29,850 --> 00:37:31,410
就改變了主意
and changed her mind.

582
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:33,490
我高興壞了
I was giddy.

583
00:37:33,930 --> 00:37:36,920
就像...圣誕節早晨的孩子
Like a... kid on Christmas morning.

584
00:37:36,930 --> 00:37:38,510
我很早就收拾好了的東西
Had my bags packed hours before

585
00:37:38,510 --> 00:37:40,160
比他預定來接我的時間提前好幾個小時
he was supposed to pick me up.

586
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:45,490
我記得自己很想向他展示我的后空翻
I remember I really wanted to show him my backflip.

587
00:37:47,930 --> 00:37:49,240
真可悲
Pathetic, really...

588
00:37:50,930 --> 00:37:52,370
但他沒來嗎
But he never turned up?

589
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:59,930
我一直沒再見到他  直到我二十多歲  而且
I didn't see him again till I was in my 20s and...

590
00:38:01,410 --> 00:38:02,610
那時我已經知道了
by then I knew.

591
00:38:03,930 --> 00:38:06,530
-知道什么  -他對我媽干的事
- Knew...? - What he'd done to Mum.

592
00:38:07,130 --> 00:38:08,960
暴力  毆打
The violence. The beatings.

593
00:38:08,970 --> 00:38:10,370
他讓她經歷的一切
What he'd put her through.

594
00:38:17,890 --> 00:38:19,280
那些可憐的女人
Those poor women...

595
00:38:20,610 --> 00:38:23,130
是誰先聯系誰的  你還是你爸
Who got back in touch, you or your dad?

596
00:38:23,530 --> 00:38:24,450
我
Me.

597
00:38:26,930 --> 00:38:28,050
我和我哥哥
Me and my brother.

598
00:38:29,490 --> 00:38:31,490
有人告訴我們他再婚了
Someone told us that he'd remarried.

599
00:38:31,530 --> 00:38:35,960
他妻子有多發性硬化癥  說他是個完美的丈夫
That his wife had MS and what an amazing husband he was,

600
00:38:35,970 --> 00:38:37,450
是個體貼的看護
what an amazing carer...

601
00:38:38,050 --> 00:38:40,240
-你肯定難以相信吧  -對
- That must've been difficult to believe? - Yeah.

602
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:44,410
我想著"我得親眼看看"  所以我們去了
"This I have to see," I thought. So we go round.

603
00:38:45,650 --> 00:38:47,570
"好啊  爸  好久不見"
"Hello, Dad. Long time, no see."

604
00:38:49,610 --> 00:38:50,640
都是真的
All true.

605
00:38:52,570 --> 00:38:55,720
他的妻子人很好  但她需要很多照顧
His wife was sweet, but she needed a lot of care...

606
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:58,970
然后他在那  細心地照顧
and there he was, providing it.

607
00:38:59,970 --> 00:39:02,850
體貼  耐心  井井有條
Kind, patient, everything organised.

608
00:39:03,610 --> 00:39:06,370
我不嫉妒她  我怎么能呢  但我...
I didn't begrudge her, how could I? But...

609
00:39:07,130 --> 00:39:08,370
看著很難受
Hard to see.

610
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:15,490
我們還要告訴你些其他事  德爾羅伊
Something else we need to tell you, Delroy.

611
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:18,880
我們完全不相信
We're giving it no credit whatsoever

612
00:39:18,890 --> 00:39:22,440
但你父親稱是你犯下了那些罪行
but your father has accused you of committing these crimes.

613
00:39:22,450 --> 00:39:23,480
-什么  -對
- What...? - Yeah.

614
00:39:23,490 --> 00:39:25,520
就像帕特麗夏說的  我們完全不信
As Patricia said, we don't believe it for a minute,

615
00:39:25,530 --> 00:39:28,640
但我們必須通過DNA測試排除你
but, er, we will have to eliminate you with a DNA test.

616
00:39:28,650 --> 00:39:30,490
抱歉  等等  他說.
Sorry, hang on, he said...

617
00:39:31,890 --> 00:39:34,850
強奸和那一切  他說都是我干的
The rapes and everything? He said it was me?

618
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:39,280
他為什么要這么說
Why would he say that?

619
00:39:39,850 --> 00:39:41,530
因為他就是這種人
Because that's the sort of person he is,

620
00:39:41,930 --> 00:39:44,370
而且從你剛才告訴我們的來看  他一直是
and, from what you're telling us, always was.

621
00:40:06,130 --> 00:40:07,320
-給你  -謝謝
- There you go. - Thanks.

622
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:10,330
他們沒有鱷梨泥  我給你買了火腿芝士
They didn't have any torn avocado, I got you ham and cheese.

623
00:40:10,610 --> 00:40:11,570
給
There you go.

624
00:40:14,530 --> 00:40:18,570
我奶奶92歲了依然染發  所剩無幾的頭發
My nan's 92 and still dyes her hair... what's left of it.

625
00:40:19,970 --> 00:40:22,640
她說當你變老后  似乎就失去了身份
She said when you get old it's like you lose your identity.

626
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:27,130
人們看不見你  只看到一個老人
People don't see you, they just see an old person -

627
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:31,610
白頭發  淺色大衣  老花鏡  羊群中的一只
grey hair, fawn coat, bad glasses, a sheep in a flock.

628
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:37,490
所以這案子這么久都沒破  隱形的受害者
That's why this went on so long. Victims were invisible.

629
00:40:37,650 --> 00:40:40,610
對  但我們其他人卻不承認
Yeah, and the rest of us are in denial.

630
00:40:41,370 --> 00:40:42,760
我們都認為不會發生在自己身上
We all think it won't happen to us.

631
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:43,560
我們能逆勢而行
We'll buck the trend.

632
00:40:43,570 --> 00:40:47,050
便盆  假牙
Bedpans, false teeth,

633
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:50,760
癡呆  助行架  不可能  不必了  我們不會
dementia, Zimmer frame. No way, no thanks. Not us, mate.

634
00:40:52,930 --> 00:40:55,200
而我們助長謊言的方式是忽略他們
And the way we feed that lie is to ignore them.

635
00:40:56,650 --> 00:40:58,930
我們注意到他們  但卻視而不見
I mean, we notice them, but we don't see them.

636
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:02,560
我們不會避開視線  但也絕不會多看一眼
We don't avert our gaze, but we certainly don't linger

637
00:41:02,570 --> 00:41:05,240
因為他們是我們不想要卻逃不過的未來
cos they're the future we don't want and can't escape.

638
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:08,200
對  就像我們在責備他們一般  對吧
Yeah. It's like we blame them, innit.

639
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:09,760
沒錯
Exactly.

640
00:41:11,930 --> 00:41:14,050
這說明了我們是怎么樣的人
And what the fuck does that say about us?

641
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:17,640
你還好嗎
You ok?

642
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:21,240
你說當這一切結束  會給我重創
You said when this was over it would hit me.

643
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:27,200
是的  我說過  來吧
Yeah, I did. Come on.

644
00:41:34,050 --> 00:41:36,560
-好消息嗎  -DNA結果剛出來
- Good news? - Just got the DNA back -

645
00:41:36,570 --> 00:41:39,760
既成事實  與我們的所有樣本都百分百匹配
effectively 100% match with all our samples.

646
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:40,680
強奸案的精液
Semen from the rapes,

647
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:43,280
哈尼斯街受害者面部的口水
saliva from the cheek of the Harness Street victim,

648
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:46,370
-科爾布里奇路的橙汁盒  -"既成事實"
- the orange juice carton at Colbridge Road... - "Effectively"?

649
00:41:46,490 --> 00:41:48,680
他們是這樣措辭的
Well, they word it like this,

650
00:41:48,850 --> 00:41:51,160
"德爾羅伊·格蘭特的DNA
"The DNA taken from Delroy Grant

651
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:56,040
與其他人相比  有47.5的10的24次方倍幾率
"is 47.5 septillion times more likely to be linked to the DNA

652
00:41:56,050 --> 00:41:59,200
與米恩斯泰德犯相關"
"of Minstead Man than an unrelated person."

653
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:01,610
"10的24次方"  我喜歡這說法
"Septillion." I like the sound of that.

654
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:04,760
-那螺絲刀的痕跡呢  -絕對是他的  老大
- What about the screwdriver marks? - Definitely his, boss.

655
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:07,320
因為我們在搜查到DNA的兩個現場看到了
As they're present at two of the scenes where we got DNA

656
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:08,880
還有其他沒有DNA的現場也有
and loads of scenes where we didn't,

657
00:42:08,890 --> 00:42:11,640
這將他與其他數起案件聯系在一起
it links him to literally dozens of offences.

658
00:42:11,650 --> 00:42:13,320
已經告知他這一切了嗎
Has he been confronted with this?

659
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:15,440
我們開始砸證據后  他就一言不發
No commented as soon as we started rolling.

660
00:42:15,450 --> 00:42:17,240
皇家檢察署給了我們時間
CPS have given us a slot.

661
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:19,480
我覺得應該盡可能多的起訴他
I say we charge him with as much as possible,

662
00:42:19,490 --> 00:42:21,410
別管什么"反正他肯定要坐牢了"
never mind "He's going down already."

663
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:25,680
我同意  我們要為盡量多的受害者伸張正義
Agreed. We get justice for as many victims as we can.

664
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:27,800
我們從嚴處置他吧
Let's throw the fucking book at him.

665
00:42:28,890 --> 00:42:32,490
你理解今天對你提起的這些指控嗎
Do you understand the charges brought against you today?

666
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:35,800
-我理解  -你怎么辯護
- Yeah, I do. - And how do you plead?

667
00:42:36,570 --> 00:42:37,640
無罪
Not guilty.

668
00:42:39,410 --> 00:42:44,920
格蘭特先生  你被起訴犯下22起罪行

和11起盜竊罪
and 11 burglaries.

673
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:57,850
盡管你拒絕認罪
Notwithstanding that you deny them,

674
00:42:58,050 --> 00:43:02,050
但在我們看來  如果被判有罪
there is, in our opinion, a very high likelihood

675
00:43:02,130 --> 00:43:08,680
你很有可能會被判很長的牢獄之刑
that, if convicted, you may well receive a long prison sentence.

676
00:43:09,130 --> 00:43:12,370

現在很多警察都過了退休年齡后繼續工作

680
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:43,160
但人總有退休的一天
Everybody's got to go sometime, though.

681
00:43:44,850 --> 00:43:45,850
我只是說說
Just saying.

682
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:50,400
基爾伯恩的督察已經退休后繼續工作五年了

前兩天還破了一樁雙殺案

685
00:43:58,970 --> 00:44:00,760
如果你想走  我可以收拾這里

690
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:14,720
你接受了我  當其他人都不怎么情愿的時候

691
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:16,930
