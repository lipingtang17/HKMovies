00:01:50,375 --> 00:01:51,785
-What are you doing?

5
00:01:58,750 --> 00:01:59,830
Violet Markey?

6
00:02:02,375 --> 00:02:03,455
Oh, my God.

7
00:02:10,583 --> 00:02:11,583
Please go.

8
00:02:13,083 --> 00:02:15,253
-Well, I don't think that's very--
-Just go!

9
00:02:31,291 --> 00:02:32,631
What are you doing?

10
00:02:33,041 --> 00:02:34,171
I asked you first.

11
00:02:38,125 --> 00:02:39,665
This is higher than I thought.

12
00:02:44,666 --> 00:02:45,496
Hey.

13
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:47,708
Hey, look.

14
00:02:48,625 --> 00:02:49,785
Look what I can do.

15
00:02:51,791 --> 00:02:53,541
Stop. Stop!

16
00:03:05,166 --> 00:03:06,166
Hey, Violet.

17
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:07,880
Hey. Do you have plans this weekend?
My parents are gonna be out of town.

18
00:04:07,958 --> 00:04:10,378
I was thinking about having a party
or something.

19
00:04:16,541 --> 00:04:17,421
Violet?

20
00:04:18,791 --> 00:04:19,631
You OK?

21
00:04:23,833 --> 00:04:25,253
How's everything going?

22
00:04:26,208 --> 00:04:27,918
"Everything" is a really big word.

23
00:04:28,916 --> 00:04:31,376
-Let's start with--
- Do you mean physically?

24
00:04:31,458 --> 00:04:34,168
Emotionally?
Those both could encompass "everything."

25
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:36,080
Or is "everything" encompassed
by both things?

26
00:04:36,166 --> 00:04:37,916
Are you feeling overwhelmed by anything?

27
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,750
If "everything" is encompassed
by both things,

28
00:04:39,833 --> 00:04:42,133
are they a part of our reality,
or are they somewhere else?

29
00:04:42,208 --> 00:04:43,668
This isn't funny, Theodore.

30
00:04:45,416 --> 00:04:46,246
Finch.

31
00:04:47,625 --> 00:04:49,785
I need you
to take these meetings seriously.

32
00:04:49,875 --> 00:04:50,875
I get it.

33
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:53,753
OK, do you "get"
that you're on probation,

34
00:04:54,791 --> 00:04:56,541
and in danger of not graduating?

35
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:01,330
You've already missed
two weeks of school this year.

36
00:05:01,958 --> 00:05:02,998
Yeah, um...

37
00:05:04,416 --> 00:05:06,126
-my grandma--
-Stop one second.

38
00:05:06,208 --> 00:05:07,918
I just wanna clarify real quickly.

39
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,130
Is this the grandma who's died four times
over the past three years?

40
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,330
Five times, actually.

41
00:05:14,083 --> 00:05:15,173
This is the fifth.

42
00:05:18,625 --> 00:05:19,875
She's our miracle.

43
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:25,000
I really wanna help you,
but you've gotta take this seriously.

44
00:05:26,291 --> 00:05:30,541
I mean, you agreed to these terms,
these weekly counseling sessions,

45
00:05:30,625 --> 00:05:33,375
maintaining a B-average,
extracurricular participation.

46
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:35,498
And I am loving pottery.

47
00:05:36,125 --> 00:05:37,125
Come on, man.

48
00:05:37,583 --> 00:05:38,713
Look, I get it.

49
00:05:38,791 --> 00:05:40,921
If I screw anything up, I'm out.

50
00:05:41,666 --> 00:05:43,536
We're not askin' a lot of you, Finch.

51
00:05:45,083 --> 00:05:46,383
You just need to show up.

52
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,460
My parents are pissed
because I missed early admissions,

53
00:05:50,541 --> 00:05:52,131
but it's not like that matters, anyway.

54
00:05:52,208 --> 00:05:54,128
I mean, I know I'm gonna get in.

55
00:05:56,333 --> 00:05:57,923
Did you apply anywhere yet?

56
00:05:59,208 --> 00:06:01,078
-Hey.
-Hi.

57
00:06:01,625 --> 00:06:03,875
So, you going to Amanda's party?

58
00:06:05,333 --> 00:06:06,383
It'll be fun.

59
00:06:07,125 --> 00:06:08,205
So I've heard.

60
00:06:08,625 --> 00:06:10,625
It couldn't hurt
to have a little fun, right?

61
00:06:11,208 --> 00:06:15,128
Yo, do you think it'd be weird
if I named my kid after a famous person?

62
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:18,668
Like, if I named him Danny DeVito Donahue,

63
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:21,420
do you...
do you think he'd be mad about it?

64
00:06:22,375 --> 00:06:23,875
Is "DeVito" the middle name?

65
00:06:24,458 --> 00:06:25,328
Yeah.

66
00:06:25,875 --> 00:06:27,875
Follow-up question:
how high are you right now?

67
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:33,250
On the scale,
I'd probably say very... this way.

68
00:06:33,333 --> 00:06:35,213
- On the scale...
- Yeah?

69
00:06:37,083 --> 00:06:38,463
What are you looking at?

70
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,250
Just admiring the social norms
of teenage angst.

71
00:06:42,833 --> 00:06:45,043
-Are you looking at Violet Markey?
-Yep.

72
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:47,080
Her, um...

73
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:49,460
her sister died, right?

74
00:06:50,458 --> 00:06:51,328
Yeah, dude.

75
00:06:51,416 --> 00:06:52,286
Hm.

76
00:06:53,083 --> 00:06:54,633
Why ask about her all of a sudden?

77
00:06:54,708 --> 00:06:56,208
I'm intrigued.
A guy can't be intrigued?

78
00:06:56,291 --> 00:06:59,541
Well, a guy can be intrigued.
You being intrigued is weird.

79
00:07:00,125 --> 00:07:03,075
- Definitely weird.
-No, I don't think it's weird.

80
00:07:03,166 --> 00:07:04,326
I wouldn't say "weird."

81
00:07:04,416 --> 00:07:06,496
Wait, if you don't think you're weird,
well...

82
00:07:07,875 --> 00:07:10,325
-Yeah, that's true. Very true.
- She has a point.

83
00:07:19,583 --> 00:07:22,463
- Your guidance counselor called.
-Embryo?

84
00:07:22,541 --> 00:07:23,421
What?

85
00:07:25,541 --> 00:07:29,461
His name's Embry. I call him Embryo.
It's the little things, Kate.

86
00:07:29,541 --> 00:07:31,631
Did you do something
I should be worried about?

87
00:07:31,708 --> 00:07:34,378
I'm genuinely offended
by that supposition.

88
00:07:34,916 --> 00:07:36,246
-Finch.
-No.

89
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,500
It's fine. I'll deal with it.

90
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:40,753
- I hate when you say that.
-Why?

91
00:07:40,833 --> 00:07:44,083
Because what you really mean is
that I'm gonna have to deal with it.

92
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:47,710
Did you cut class again?

93
00:07:47,791 --> 00:07:49,381
No! For fuck's sake,

94
00:07:49,458 --> 00:07:52,208
just go hang out with Tina
or whatever it is you do.

95
00:07:52,291 --> 00:07:53,171
I'm fine.

96
00:07:54,083 --> 00:07:57,333
OK. I'm gonna be home late.
There's food in the fridge.

97
00:07:57,416 --> 00:07:59,126
-Mm-hmm.
-Real food, Finch.

98
00:07:59,833 --> 00:08:00,713
Where's Mom?

99
00:08:00,791 --> 00:08:03,041
She had to go to Chicago for business.
Remember?

100
00:08:03,125 --> 00:08:05,285
-Oh, yeah, right. Cool.
-Love you.

101
00:08:05,583 --> 00:08:06,503
Hey.

102
00:08:10,583 --> 00:08:11,833
-Love you.
-Love you.

103
00:08:13,541 --> 00:08:15,381
No more cheese, Finch!

104
00:08:28,208 --> 00:08:29,668
I'm gonna get the dessert.

105
00:08:35,625 --> 00:08:38,785
Your mother and I know
that today couldn't have been easy.

106
00:08:39,708 --> 00:08:41,828
And it wasn't easy for us either.

107
00:08:46,541 --> 00:08:48,961
-If you need to talk about it--

108
00:08:51,625 --> 00:08:53,415
I thought this would be nice.

109
00:09:05,875 --> 00:09:07,625
I've been making it for 19 years.

110
00:11:11,958 --> 00:11:13,668
As some of you
will be graduating

111
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:15,420
and leaving us at the end of the year,

112
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:19,210
I feel an obligation to make sure
you see the wondrous sights of Indiana

113
00:11:19,291 --> 00:11:20,381
while you can.

114
00:11:20,458 --> 00:11:23,458
To wander them, if you will.

115
00:11:24,458 --> 00:11:28,788
For your class project, you must report
on two or more wonders of Indiana.

116
00:11:28,875 --> 00:11:30,495
You will write about them,

117
00:11:30,583 --> 00:11:33,753
explain their significance
to you and to Indiana,

118
00:11:33,833 --> 00:11:35,463
and why you chose to visit them.

119
00:11:36,125 --> 00:11:38,245
I want you to take time
on this assignment.

120
00:11:38,333 --> 00:11:39,503
Be thoughtful.

121
00:11:42,458 --> 00:11:43,288
OK.

122
00:11:44,958 --> 00:11:45,958
What just happened?

123
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:47,960
That was so weird.

124
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:49,501
-What?
- All right, settle.

125
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:50,633
Violet, are you OK?

126
00:11:51,708 --> 00:11:54,538
All right, let's take our seats.
Let's focus up.

127
00:11:55,166 --> 00:11:56,916
If you're done, Mr. Finch?

128
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:01,040
Yes, I am done, and can I just say you
are doing a fine job teaching this class.

129
00:12:01,125 --> 00:12:03,125
My young brain is plump with knowledge.

130
00:12:03,916 --> 00:12:06,206
- Thank you, Mr. Finch.
-You're welcome.

131
00:12:06,708 --> 00:12:08,168
As I was saying,

132
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:11,960
you'll be taking photos,
doing some drawings, capturing detail.

133
00:12:12,041 --> 00:12:14,751
You will be doing this in teams of two.

134
00:12:16,041 --> 00:12:17,461
Can we choose our partners?

135
00:12:17,875 --> 00:12:18,995
Yes, Mr. Finch.

136
00:12:21,958 --> 00:12:22,788
Hey.

137
00:12:25,916 --> 00:12:26,916
So, um...

138
00:12:27,958 --> 00:12:31,498
do you think that there's such a thing
as a perfect day?

139
00:12:32,791 --> 00:12:34,881
I'm the last person you should be asking.

140
00:12:59,708 --> 00:13:01,378
<i> For my geography class,</i>

141
00:13:01,458 --> 00:13:05,128
this teacher wants us to do this project
with a partner,

142
00:13:05,208 --> 00:13:07,288
and I just don't wanna do it.

143
00:13:07,708 --> 00:13:10,128
Well, did you ask
for an alternate project?

144
00:13:10,875 --> 00:13:12,745
Yeah, he just... he wouldn't listen.

145
00:13:13,583 --> 00:13:15,253
Well, maybe it's time
to get back out there.

146
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:17,330
That's the same thing he said.

147
00:13:19,958 --> 00:13:21,168
I know it's hard.

148
00:13:22,666 --> 00:13:25,326
-But you just don't go out anymore.
-That's not true.

149
00:13:25,416 --> 00:13:27,786
When's the last time you hung out
with your friends?

150
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:32,580
I think it would be really good
if you'd spend some time with them.

151
00:13:34,166 --> 00:13:37,626
So, if I hung out with my friends,
you'd get me outta this assignment?

152
00:13:41,333 --> 00:13:44,423

00:13:55,791 --> 00:13:58,081
- You came.
- I did.

157
00:13:58,833 --> 00:14:00,003
- Hey.
-Hi.

158
00:14:00,416 --> 00:14:03,166
-I'm gonna get a drink. Do you want one?
-I'm good.

159
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:04,630
Come on, babe.

160
00:14:05,166 --> 00:14:06,126
OK.

161
00:14:47,041 --> 00:14:47,881
Yeah...

162
00:14:58,416 --> 00:14:59,496
Hey.

163
00:15:01,125 --> 00:15:02,455
That's a heavy pour.

164
00:15:03,083 --> 00:15:04,713
You know me. I love to rage.

165
00:15:04,791 --> 00:15:07,881
So, you wanna go out back?
Talk a little?

166
00:15:10,291 --> 00:15:12,711
I think I'm gonna leave pretty soon,
actually.

167
00:15:13,375 --> 00:15:16,125
Really? But... I mean, I just got here.

168
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:19,498
It's just all a little much, you know?

169
00:15:21,208 --> 00:15:23,458
How much longer
are you gonna act like this?

170
00:15:25,125 --> 00:15:27,625
It's been months.
When are you gonna just...

171
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:33,670
Nice.

172
00:15:35,666 --> 00:15:38,416
Violet, you know
I didn't mean it like that. Just...

180
00:16:31,708 --> 00:16:32,828
Theodore Finch speaking.

181
00:16:32,916 --> 00:16:34,166
Take it down now.

182
00:16:36,708 --> 00:16:40,998
The video will self-destruct
in three, two...

183
00:16:42,291 --> 00:16:43,291
<i>...please refresh.</i>

184
00:16:46,541 --> 00:16:47,711
Why would you do that?

185
00:16:48,125 --> 00:16:49,745
I wanna talk about the bridge.

186
00:16:53,291 --> 00:16:57,211
<i>"I feel we can't go through</i>
<i>another of those terrible times."</i>

187
00:17:00,416 --> 00:17:03,166
One morning barely qualifies
as a terrible time.

188
00:17:03,541 --> 00:17:04,831
It's a quote.

189
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:06,830
Virginia Woolf.

190
00:17:08,791 --> 00:17:09,671
OK.

191
00:17:11,208 --> 00:17:12,208
Can I come over?

192
00:17:13,333 --> 00:17:14,253
<i> Now?</i>

193
00:17:15,291 --> 00:17:16,381
Yeah.

194
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:28,380
So...

195
00:17:29,333 --> 00:17:31,003
I Googled you.

196
00:17:33,958 --> 00:17:35,328
You <i>Googled </i>me?

197
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:39,630
Yeah, what's with that...

198
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:43,130
the website that you have
with your sister?

199
00:17:44,958 --> 00:17:45,878
Had.

200
00:17:50,458 --> 00:17:52,538
I read some of your stuff.
It's really good.

201
00:17:53,875 --> 00:17:55,125
I don't write anymore.

202
00:17:58,583 --> 00:18:01,793
So, you moved here from California.

203
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:05,333
How was that?

204
00:18:06,666 --> 00:18:08,166
California to Indiana?

205
00:18:09,125 --> 00:18:10,415
Must've been different.

206
00:18:12,125 --> 00:18:12,955
Yeah.

207
00:18:23,375 --> 00:18:25,125
I didn't know that it happened there.

208
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:27,750
At the bridge.

209
00:18:31,083 --> 00:18:32,713
I'm not, you know...

210
00:18:35,583 --> 00:18:36,923
Suicidal?

211
00:18:37,791 --> 00:18:38,791
You can say it.

212
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:40,500
Well, I'm not.

213
00:18:42,458 --> 00:18:45,208
Whatever you are, I saved your life.

214
00:18:48,083 --> 00:18:49,253
No, you didn't.

215
00:18:50,666 --> 00:18:52,826
You're making a big deal out of nothing.

216
00:18:53,416 --> 00:18:55,626
Mm... kinda looked like somethin'.

217
00:18:58,250 --> 00:18:59,710
What do you want from me?

218
00:19:00,875 --> 00:19:03,875
I was just thinkin' that
we should be partners.

219
00:19:04,583 --> 00:19:06,043
For the wandering project.

220
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:09,080
I think it would be good for you
to get out.

221
00:19:10,125 --> 00:19:11,535
Maybe I don't wanna get out.

222
00:19:12,625 --> 00:19:14,125
Maybe I'm sick of people.

223
00:19:17,041 --> 00:19:18,581
Yeah, people are stupid.

224
00:19:19,416 --> 00:19:24,416
But the tiniest few
might actually mean well.

225
00:19:26,083 --> 00:19:28,383
Why do you wanna do this with me, anyway?

226
00:19:29,833 --> 00:19:32,633
Because there are places
that need to be seen.

227
00:19:33,333 --> 00:19:35,583
Maybe even the smallest of places

228
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:37,750
can mean something.

229
00:19:37,875 --> 00:19:39,285
At the very least,

230
00:19:40,041 --> 00:19:42,171
maybe they can mean something to us.

231
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:43,330
Not an "us."

232
00:19:44,666 --> 00:19:48,626
Maybe they can mean something
to you and me.

233
00:19:48,708 --> 00:19:51,168
Jesus, they call <i>me </i>anti-social.

234
00:19:51,708 --> 00:19:54,288
Two wanders. That's all.

235
00:19:55,583 --> 00:19:57,583
We can do more if you end up loving it.

236
00:19:57,666 --> 00:19:58,666
I won't.

237
00:19:59,666 --> 00:20:00,746
You might.

238
00:20:01,375 --> 00:20:03,535
No, I won't.

239
00:20:07,583 --> 00:20:10,883
Oh, I found another quote for you.

240
00:20:14,083 --> 00:20:17,293
"I feel a thousand capacities
spring up in me."

241
00:20:18,458 --> 00:20:21,748
<i>The Waves. </i>It's from <i>The Waves.</i>

242
00:20:23,083 --> 00:20:26,713
You've got at least
a thousand capacities in you.

243
00:20:28,625 --> 00:20:30,075
Even if you don't think so.

244
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:35,250
You can keep that one.

245
00:20:44,875 --> 00:20:47,245
You know people call you
"The Freak," right?

246
00:20:49,291 --> 00:20:50,171
Yeah.

247
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:55,916
Sometimes I say and do things
without thinking, and...

248
00:20:57,041 --> 00:21:00,081
people don't like that,
people like labels.

249
00:21:00,166 --> 00:21:01,576
They like putting you in a box.

250
00:21:01,666 --> 00:21:04,286
They want you to be
who they want you to be.

251
00:21:07,666 --> 00:21:09,246
People don't like messy.

252
00:21:10,583 --> 00:21:11,583
Or different.

253
00:21:16,333 --> 00:21:19,213
My parents are calling Hudson
to get me outta the project,

254
00:21:19,291 --> 00:21:21,171
so you need to find another partner.

255
00:21:24,416 --> 00:21:25,326
OK.

256
00:21:29,625 --> 00:21:32,205
Good night, Violet Markey.

257
00:21:33,291 --> 00:21:34,291
Good night...

258
00:21:36,041 --> 00:21:37,331
Theodore Finch.

259
00:22:04,125 --> 00:22:05,875
Hey. Hey!

260
00:22:06,416 --> 00:22:07,326
Violet.

261
00:22:08,958 --> 00:22:10,128
Hey, where you going?

262
00:22:11,083 --> 00:22:11,963
Home.

263
00:22:12,708 --> 00:22:14,078
How'd it go with Hudson?

264
00:22:15,833 --> 00:22:16,833
Not great.

265
00:22:17,458 --> 00:22:18,418
Yeah.

266
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,540
He feels pretty strongly
about participation.

267
00:22:28,416 --> 00:22:29,326
OK...

268
00:22:32,166 --> 00:22:33,536
but no cars.

269
00:22:34,958 --> 00:22:36,128
Come again?

270
00:22:36,208 --> 00:22:37,578
If you wanna do this with me,

271
00:22:37,666 --> 00:22:40,956
you have to figure out another way
because I'm not getting in a car.

272
00:23:09,041 --> 00:23:10,501
<i>Can I ask you a question?</i>

273
00:23:11,791 --> 00:23:14,001
<i>Where would you go</i>
<i>if you could go anywhere?</i>

274
00:23:15,916 --> 00:23:19,036
- <i>California.</i>
- <i>But you've already been there.</i>

275
00:23:20,791 --> 00:23:21,791
<i>Yeah.</i>

276
00:23:22,416 --> 00:23:24,786
<i>It's warm and it never snows.</i>

277
00:23:26,791 --> 00:23:30,001
<i>Don't you wanna know where I'd go</i>
<i>if I could go anywhere?</i>

278
00:23:31,333 --> 00:23:34,083
<i>Where would you go</i>
<i>if you could go anywhere?</i>

279
00:23:34,791 --> 00:23:38,331
<i>I'd go to a place</i>
<i>no one's ever been before.</i>

280
00:23:38,958 --> 00:23:40,208
<i>Undiscovered.</i>

281
00:23:40,291 --> 00:23:41,291
<i>Untouched.</i>

282
00:23:42,375 --> 00:23:44,575
<i>You could come... if you want.</i>

283
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:57,540
That's it?

284
00:24:04,083 --> 00:24:05,583
Get on up here, Ultraviolet.

285
00:24:05,666 --> 00:24:06,496
No.

286
00:24:06,958 --> 00:24:08,128
Come on.

287
00:24:09,125 --> 00:24:10,955
Come on. The view is incredible.

288
00:24:15,333 --> 00:24:16,333
Come on.

289
00:24:28,541 --> 00:24:30,831
So, what do we think?

290
00:24:31,666 --> 00:24:33,496
The highest point in Indiana.

291
00:24:35,583 --> 00:24:39,673
I think if I were here for literally any
other reason than why you and I are here,

292
00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:40,830
I'd be pissed.

293
00:24:42,166 --> 00:24:45,076
Oh, wow. Is that a sense of humor
you're hiding in there?

294
00:24:45,166 --> 00:24:46,376
-Hm.

295
00:24:48,833 --> 00:24:51,753
This is the lamest thing
I think I've ever seen.

296
00:25:03,708 --> 00:25:06,748
It's OK, you know?
You're not going to hell for laughing.

297
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,040
It's pretty lame.

298
00:25:16,791 --> 00:25:18,421
It was my sister's birthday.

299
00:25:21,333 --> 00:25:22,793
She would've been 19.

300
00:25:25,291 --> 00:25:26,961
That's why I was at the bridge.

301
00:25:33,791 --> 00:25:34,961
Why were you there?

302
00:25:38,750 --> 00:25:39,920
I like to run.

303
00:25:43,083 --> 00:25:44,833
It's pretty early to run.

304
00:25:44,916 --> 00:25:45,916
Yeah.

305
00:25:50,916 --> 00:25:51,916
Let's jump.

306
00:25:54,333 --> 00:25:55,333
You with me?

307
00:25:59,291 --> 00:26:00,461
All right, on three.

308
00:26:02,041 --> 00:26:03,131
You gotta get ready.

309
00:26:03,208 --> 00:26:04,578
One... there it is,

310
00:26:04,666 --> 00:26:05,536
two,

311
00:26:06,416 --> 00:26:07,326
three.

312
00:26:10,708 --> 00:26:11,878
Wow.

313
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:13,500
All right.

314
00:26:15,625 --> 00:26:18,125
These are the things we leave behind.

315
00:26:18,875 --> 00:26:19,785
Pick one.

316
00:26:22,916 --> 00:26:24,076
Not that one.

317
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:26,960
Yeah. That's a good choice.

318
00:26:43,166 --> 00:26:45,166
-What?
-You didn't know?

319
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,080
This is a motherfucking staring contest.

320
00:26:49,416 --> 00:26:50,576
You can't be serious.

321
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,830
Look at my face. I'm really serious.

322
00:26:54,791 --> 00:26:55,711
Fine.

323
00:26:56,708 --> 00:26:57,998
I'm very competitive.

324
00:26:58,083 --> 00:26:59,083
Me too.

325
00:27:45,333 --> 00:27:47,083
I'm staying over at Tina's tonight.

326
00:27:48,291 --> 00:27:49,171
OK.

327
00:27:50,958 --> 00:27:51,878
"OK"?

328
00:27:53,208 --> 00:27:54,038
Yeah.

329
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:58,130
Usually, that incites a diatribe

330
00:27:58,208 --> 00:28:00,708
-about how Tina's an asshole...
-"Diatribe." Good word.

331
00:28:00,791 --> 00:28:02,831
...and how I shouldn't spend
so much time with her.

332
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,080
Yeah, well, it appears that
my many rantings on this topic

333
00:28:07,166 --> 00:28:10,076
have stuck with you,
and I don't have to preach anymore.

334
00:28:10,791 --> 00:28:12,041
What's going on with you?

335
00:28:13,875 --> 00:28:14,825
Nothing.

336
00:28:16,250 --> 00:28:17,380
You seem, like...

337
00:28:18,833 --> 00:28:19,753
goofy.

338
00:28:23,750 --> 00:28:24,920
You're goofy.

339
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,420
<i>"I feel we can't go through</i>
<i>another of those terrible times."</i>

340
00:29:24,250 --> 00:29:27,080
<i>"Why are women</i>
<i>so much more interesting to men</i>

341

349

She was bossy... <i> </i>like you.

351
00:33:47,125 --> 00:33:48,325
I like her already.

352
00:33:52,250 --> 00:33:53,710
She hated reading.

353
00:33:56,666 --> 00:33:58,626
She only liked this Italian poet,

354
00:33:59,875 --> 00:34:01,325
Cesare Pavese.

355
00:34:02,583 --> 00:34:07,173
He said, "We do not remember days,
we remember moments."

356
00:34:10,250 --> 00:34:12,040
Any time I was having a bad day,

357
00:34:13,583 --> 00:34:15,213
she always said that.

358
00:34:15,291 --> 00:34:17,501
Like it was supposed to fix something.

359
00:34:18,625 --> 00:34:19,575
Did it?

360
00:34:21,750 --> 00:34:22,670
Yeah.

361
00:34:23,666 --> 00:34:24,626
It did.

362
00:34:27,666 --> 00:34:28,666
What else?

363
00:34:34,291 --> 00:34:35,751
She was my best friend.

364
00:34:42,083 --> 00:34:43,383
"Eleanor Markey.

365
00:34:44,625 --> 00:34:45,705
Sister...

366
00:34:47,250 --> 00:34:48,250
best friend."

367
00:34:52,250 --> 00:34:53,630
That's a pretty good epitaph.

368
00:34:57,625 --> 00:34:58,745
What would yours be?

369
00:35:02,958 --> 00:35:04,168
"Violet Markey.

370
00:35:06,583 --> 00:35:07,583
I was here."

371
00:35:11,916 --> 00:35:14,706
Yeah, I'm gonna have to steal that one
from you.

372
00:35:23,625 --> 00:35:24,995
You making pancakes?

373
00:35:25,791 --> 00:35:26,921
Yeah.

374
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,710
-Blueberry pancakes?
- Yup.

375
00:35:30,583 --> 00:35:31,883
Lookin' pretty good.

376
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:35,330
-Wanna flip 'em?
- Yeah, are they ready?

377
00:35:35,416 --> 00:35:37,706
- Yeah. Well, give it a--
- Almost ready.

378
00:35:38,750 --> 00:35:40,460
-These look pretty good.
- Yeah.

379
00:35:42,333 --> 00:35:43,213
OK.

380
00:35:44,666 --> 00:35:46,826
- There we go. That one's good.

381
00:35:46,916 --> 00:35:49,036
- Yeah, there you go. Golden brown

382
00:35:56,583 --> 00:35:58,383
-Hey.
-Hi.

383
00:35:58,458 --> 00:35:59,828
Where've you been?

384
00:36:00,708 --> 00:36:03,378
You're not mad that
I'm doing that project with Roamer, right?

385
00:36:03,833 --> 00:36:04,673
No.

386
00:36:04,750 --> 00:36:06,880
OK, cool.
'Cause it's, like, it's not a thing.

387
00:36:06,958 --> 00:36:09,078
No, it's fine. I'm doing it with Finch.

388
00:36:09,625 --> 00:36:10,495
With Finch?

389
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:11,880
Yeah.

390
00:36:13,708 --> 00:36:16,628
You know that he's, like, kinda dangerous?

391
00:36:17,708 --> 00:36:18,918
No, he's not.

392
00:36:20,083 --> 00:36:22,543
He freaked out last year
and threw a chair at Roamer,

393
00:36:22,625 --> 00:36:24,375
like, in the middle of class.

394
00:36:25,666 --> 00:36:26,576
He did?

395
00:36:27,583 --> 00:36:31,423
Yeah, like, Roamer was fine,
but he's seriously fucked up.

396
00:36:43,958 --> 00:36:49,748
So, I was thinking we should check out
the Shoe Tree or the abandoned drive-in,

397
00:36:49,833 --> 00:36:52,133
depending on whatever you're feeling.

398
00:36:54,125 --> 00:36:55,285
What is this?

399
00:36:55,708 --> 00:36:57,918
That's a reminder that sooner or later,

400
00:36:58,291 --> 00:37:00,671
you're gonna have to get back
into the world all by yourself.

401
00:37:01,083 --> 00:37:02,883
But I'm happy pushing you for now.

402
00:37:04,958 --> 00:37:08,038
Well, I said
I was only gonna do two, so...

403
00:37:12,166 --> 00:37:14,076
I prefer Private Violet to...

404
00:37:14,875 --> 00:37:15,875
Public Violet.

405
00:37:15,958 --> 00:37:17,248
Can you put her on?

406
00:37:17,333 --> 00:37:18,173
I'll wait.

407
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:20,330
Maybe you should
give her some space.

408
00:37:22,625 --> 00:37:25,125
Nice sweater. What's that, a cotton blend?

409
00:37:26,875 --> 00:37:30,455
People think this whole "freak" thing
is an act. I know it's real.

410
00:37:33,958 --> 00:37:34,998
Of course it is.

411
00:37:42,166 --> 00:37:43,206
How are things?

412
00:37:44,041 --> 00:37:46,631
Just your average teenage melodrama.

413
00:37:47,625 --> 00:37:49,705
Come on. You gotta give me more than that.

414
00:37:51,750 --> 00:37:53,880
People are always telling me what I am.

415
00:37:54,458 --> 00:37:55,458
A freak.

416
00:37:56,375 --> 00:37:57,375
I get it.

417
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,330
Doesn't mean
it doesn't piss me off sometimes.

418
00:38:00,416 --> 00:38:02,246
Well, that must be hard.

419
00:38:08,916 --> 00:38:09,916
Come on, man.

420
00:38:10,458 --> 00:38:12,458
Come on. Help me out here.
Come on. Help me out.

421
00:38:18,583 --> 00:38:20,463
Maybe if...

422
00:38:21,333 --> 00:38:22,963
you got a fainting couch,

423
00:38:23,916 --> 00:38:25,626
you could put it right over there.

424
00:38:25,708 --> 00:38:28,628
It would really give me the <i>mise en scène</i>
that I was looking for.

425
00:38:29,291 --> 00:38:30,631
Tie the whole room together.

426
00:38:30,708 --> 00:38:33,248
Did you look into that support group
I told you to check out?

427
00:38:33,333 --> 00:38:35,713
I might've lost the info on that one.

428
00:38:35,791 --> 00:38:38,211
Come on, Theodore. It's a small ask, man.

429
00:38:39,291 --> 00:38:43,671
All right. It's Mondays
after school at First Congregational.

430
00:38:44,125 --> 00:38:46,415
-It's called Fresh Approach...
-Ooh!

431
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:48,040
...and it is confidential,

432
00:38:48,458 --> 00:38:52,288
so you can say whatever you want
about anything that's bothering you.

433
00:38:53,250 --> 00:38:56,880
It is a safe space, Finch.

434
00:38:57,333 --> 00:38:58,833
I want you to think about it.

435
00:39:05,166 --> 00:39:06,996
What now? Now what are we doing? What?

436
00:39:07,083 --> 00:39:08,383
What's happenin'?

437
00:39:08,458 --> 00:39:09,498
Is this a knock-off?

438
00:39:09,583 --> 00:39:10,923
The Post-it?

439
00:39:11,541 --> 00:39:13,631
-This is off-brand.

Hey.

455
00:40:32,833 --> 00:40:34,253
Did you sleep out here?

456
00:40:35,750 --> 00:40:36,630
Yeah.

457
00:40:40,458 --> 00:40:43,248
I know you said that you were done,

458
00:40:43,875 --> 00:40:45,915
but what if I told you

459
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:49,040
that I found the best wander
in the state of Indiana,

460
00:40:49,125 --> 00:40:51,205
possibly the world, but...

461
00:40:53,125 --> 00:40:54,495
it was 160 miles away?

462
00:40:55,375 --> 00:40:58,285
I'd say have fun,
and I can't wait to hear all about it.

463
00:40:58,833 --> 00:41:01,753
Come on! Just give it a chance.

464
00:41:01,833 --> 00:41:03,793
-At least sit inside.
-No, Finch.

465
00:41:03,875 --> 00:41:05,205
I'm not getting in a car!

466
00:41:05,291 --> 00:41:07,291
Look, here. I'll take the keys, and...

467
00:41:10,666 --> 00:41:14,076
I swear not to drive faster
than 30 miles per hour through town

468
00:41:14,166 --> 00:41:15,666
or 50 on the interstate.

469
00:41:16,625 --> 00:41:18,825
If at any time you wanna stop, we stop.

470
00:41:19,666 --> 00:41:21,626
You can't keep pushing people.

471
00:41:21,708 --> 00:41:25,828
You don't listen. We did it.
The project is over. This is over.

472
00:41:26,291 --> 00:41:28,791
You know this isn't
about a class assignment.

473
00:41:29,541 --> 00:41:33,211
This is about you being holed up
in your room or on your stupid bike,

474
00:41:33,291 --> 00:41:35,421
always circling
the same three-mile radius.

475
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:38,420
And God forbid anyone risk upsetting
"Poor Violet," but...

476
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:40,710
-they're wrong.

477
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:43,380
Violet.

478
00:41:43,916 --> 00:41:45,246
Is everything OK out here?

479
00:41:45,333 --> 00:41:46,673
-Fine.
-Hey.

480
00:41:46,750 --> 00:41:51,040
Sorry. Hey. Hi, I'm Theodore Finch.
Pleasure to meet you both.

481
00:41:51,125 --> 00:41:54,495
-Little early, don't you think, Theodore?
-Yes. Yes, it is early.

482
00:41:54,583 --> 00:41:56,003
That is a fair observation.

483
00:41:56,083 --> 00:41:58,923
But you see, I'm your daughter's partner
for the school project,

484
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,380
and we really need to get to this place.

485
00:42:03,291 --> 00:42:05,421
Basically, I need her to get into the car.

486
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:06,630
That car.

487
00:42:07,625 --> 00:42:10,205
That is extremely safe, insured,

488
00:42:10,791 --> 00:42:14,211
with an experienced driver who hasn't
gotten so much as a speeding ticket.

489
00:42:14,291 --> 00:42:15,711
This is for a school project?

490
00:42:16,125 --> 00:42:17,955
Yes, sir. We're partners.

491
00:42:19,958 --> 00:42:23,578
Well, Theodore, I think
it's Violet's decision to make, but...

492
00:42:25,083 --> 00:42:26,583
maybe not a bad idea.

493
00:42:39,666 --> 00:42:41,376
You think she's coming back?

494
00:42:41,458 --> 00:42:44,078
Hey, your guess is as good as ours.

495
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:56,500
Oh.

496
00:42:57,291 --> 00:42:58,541
No, wait. No.

497
00:43:02,250 --> 00:43:05,710
OK. If I were keys, where would I hide?

498
00:43:15,375 --> 00:43:16,825
How are we doin' over there?

499
00:43:16,916 --> 00:43:17,826
Fine.

500
00:43:18,416 --> 00:43:19,326
You sure?

501
00:43:19,416 --> 00:43:21,746
Just stop asking me.
You're making it worse.

502
00:43:22,541 --> 00:43:23,961
Talk about something else.

503
00:43:24,791 --> 00:43:26,881
Usually, that is my forte.

504
00:43:26,958 --> 00:43:29,128
But right now, I got nothin'.

505
00:43:33,083 --> 00:43:35,543
♪ <i>...build this thing together ♪</i>

506
00:43:49,916 --> 00:43:51,166
It's a good song.

507
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:46,080
I don't remember how fast we were going.

508
00:44:46,375 --> 00:44:48,245
It didn't seem fast.

509
00:44:55,666 --> 00:44:57,076
Then we were sliding...

510
00:45:03,708 --> 00:45:06,288
and Eleanor was saying, "I can't hold on."

511
00:45:10,666 --> 00:45:13,286
And then the car slammed into the bridge.

512
00:45:24,208 --> 00:45:25,538
I just remember the...

513
00:45:25,625 --> 00:45:27,625
the glass hitting my face

514
00:45:28,250 --> 00:45:29,750
and Eleanor screaming.

515
00:45:35,416 --> 00:45:36,286
Then...

516
00:45:37,375 --> 00:45:39,495
after that, it just all goes blank.

517
00:45:47,250 --> 00:45:49,170
When I woke up in the hospital,

518
00:45:51,333 --> 00:45:53,253
my mom told me she was gone.

519
00:46:00,958 --> 00:46:02,288
And that was it.

520
00:47:19,708 --> 00:47:21,288
Still mad you got in the car?

521
00:47:40,458 --> 00:47:42,878
- You really built this yourself?
-Yes, I did.

522
00:47:42,958 --> 00:47:43,878
That's impressive.

523
00:47:44,291 --> 00:47:46,791
- All right. Here we go.
- Let's do it.

524
00:47:46,958 --> 00:47:49,828
-I'm gonna do it.

525
00:47:49,916 --> 00:47:51,456
- Have a good one.

526
00:47:57,250 --> 00:47:58,830
I can see my house from here.

527
00:48:07,458 --> 00:48:08,458
Ah...

528
00:48:14,666 --> 00:48:17,536
Woo!

529
00:48:17,625 --> 00:48:18,495
Yeah!

530
00:48:19,041 --> 00:48:21,421
-That was amazing.
- Good job!

531
00:48:22,791 --> 00:48:24,131
Did it feel fast?

532
00:48:24,208 --> 00:48:27,418
-Oh, yeah. It's just like the real thing.

533
00:48:27,750 --> 00:48:28,750
Are you ready?

534
00:48:30,125 --> 00:48:32,245
All right. Here we go. You ready?

535
00:48:32,333 --> 00:48:33,383
Oh, my God.

536
00:48:50,750 --> 00:48:52,380
- Yes!

537
00:49:01,208 --> 00:49:02,748
- Yeah!

538
00:49:02,833 --> 00:49:04,213
Yay!

539
00:49:05,875 --> 00:49:07,375
Oh, my God!

540
00:49:10,416 --> 00:49:11,826
I wanna go again.

541
00:49:12,875 --> 00:49:15,285

that I'm gonna take you to one day.

555
00:50:30,791 --> 00:50:31,791
Oh, yeah?

556
00:50:32,541 --> 00:50:35,831
Yeah, but you're gonna need
to start pullin' your weight, OK?

I got you this...

558
00:50:37,541 --> 00:50:40,421
just in case you've forgotten
this is a school project,

559
00:50:41,083 --> 00:50:42,463
you have to write about it.

560
00:50:43,250 --> 00:50:44,290
Just me?

561
00:50:44,750 --> 00:50:45,920
You're the writer.

562
00:50:53,166 --> 00:50:54,666
"Wander number three..."

563
00:50:54,750 --> 00:50:56,500
No. You gotta start with Hoosier Hill.

564
00:50:56,583 --> 00:50:58,583
You know, you don't have to be so pushy.

565
00:50:58,666 --> 00:51:00,706
You say "pushy," and I hear, um...

566
00:51:01,208 --> 00:51:02,288
"assertive,"

567
00:51:02,750 --> 00:51:03,750
"bold,"

568
00:51:04,375 --> 00:51:05,375
"inspiring."

569
00:51:06,666 --> 00:51:08,786
Uh... relentless. Irritating.

570
00:51:09,291 --> 00:51:10,711
Arrogant.

571
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:12,040
Sexy.

572
00:51:18,875 --> 00:51:20,665
It's nice to have a friend again.

573
00:51:27,416 --> 00:51:29,076
Don't let that go to your head.

574
00:51:31,458 --> 00:51:32,458
Too late.

575
00:51:40,416 --> 00:51:42,626
You know what I like about you,
Ultraviolet?

576
00:51:44,291 --> 00:51:45,291

- Hello.

585
00:55:31,708 --> 00:55:35,458
Before we get started,
we are nearing D-Day, people.

586
00:55:36,958 --> 00:55:39,168
The day to present your wanderings.

587
00:55:39,250 --> 00:55:40,250
That is correct.

588
00:55:40,333 --> 00:55:41,293
Along with your essay,

589
00:55:41,375 --> 00:55:46,915
I'm going to be asking each group
to do a presentation to the whole class.

590
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:50,290
But today, we're talking about
the five themes of geography:

591
00:55:50,375 --> 00:55:51,915
location, place...

592
00:56:01,333 --> 00:56:04,583
No, but honestly,
I wouldn't even worry about it.

593
00:56:04,666 --> 00:56:06,536
-This is just what Finch does.
- Yeah.

594
00:56:07,416 --> 00:56:10,956
I've texted him for the past couple days,
and he hasn't responded.

595
00:56:11,041 --> 00:56:12,961
I mean, this is...

596
00:56:13,041 --> 00:56:17,831
...I mean, sometimes he's gone for a day,
like, maybe two, but he always turns up.

597
00:56:17,916 --> 00:56:20,956
Yeah, there was that one time
that he was gone for like a week.

598
00:56:21,041 --> 00:56:23,081
-Oh, my God.
-He came back and said he went camping,

599
00:56:23,166 --> 00:56:25,416
and he had all these poison ivy spots
on him...

600
00:56:25,500 --> 00:56:27,750
-Covered in spots.
-...itching, it was like... yeah.

601
00:56:27,833 --> 00:56:29,713
It was bad. It was so bad.

602
00:56:29,791 --> 00:56:31,291
I think it's pretty fucked up.

603
00:56:32,583 --> 00:56:34,753
It's easy to pick up your phone
and respond.

604
00:56:34,833 --> 00:56:38,003
It's... that's just something
you have to deal with

605
00:56:38,083 --> 00:56:40,043
if you wanna be close with him, you know?

606
00:56:40,458 --> 00:56:41,828
It just makes me mad.

607
00:56:44,333 --> 00:56:46,833
Yeah. So, we've been to a lot
of really interesting places so far.

608
00:56:46,916 --> 00:56:48,626
Do you have an actual plan,

609
00:56:48,708 --> 00:56:50,878
or you've just kind of been shooting
from the hip?

610
00:56:50,958 --> 00:56:54,378
Honestly? I'm just trying to distract her
into spending as much time with me

611
00:56:54,458 --> 00:56:56,288
as she can.

612
00:56:56,375 --> 00:56:58,375
And has it been going OK, or--

613
00:56:58,458 --> 00:57:00,328
Yeah, I think so. I've been really...

614
00:57:01,166 --> 00:57:02,786
Look who stopped by.

615
00:57:04,083 --> 00:57:04,963
Hey.

616
00:57:06,541 --> 00:57:09,081
Did you lose your phone?
I've been texting. I've been calling.

617
00:57:09,166 --> 00:57:11,326
Look, let me just show
you this really fast. Hold on.

618
00:57:11,500 --> 00:57:13,920
-You could've taken a second to respond...
-I know.

619
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,540
-...so I knew you were OK.
-I had to take care of a couple things.

620
00:57:34,375 --> 00:57:36,245
It's supposedly bottomless.

621
00:57:37,666 --> 00:57:40,126
In the '50s,
a group of boys went swimming here,

622
00:57:41,166 --> 00:57:42,456
and they disappeared.

623
00:57:42,541 --> 00:57:44,131
No one ever found their bodies.

624
00:57:44,666 --> 00:57:45,826
They drowned?

625
00:57:47,208 --> 00:57:48,208
Eh...

626
00:57:48,791 --> 00:57:49,751
maybe.

627
00:57:51,708 --> 00:57:54,038
Or maybe they found the other side.

628
00:57:55,458 --> 00:57:59,038
They say there's a force in the middle
that sucks you into an underground river

629
00:57:59,125 --> 00:58:00,955
and leads you to another world.

630
00:58:07,500 --> 00:58:08,880
You're not going in?

631
00:58:09,833 --> 00:58:11,043
Oh, of course I am.

632
00:58:12,208 --> 00:58:13,958
It'll be freezing.

633
00:58:14,041 --> 00:58:15,211
It'll be fine.

634
00:58:19,958 --> 00:58:20,958
You should come in.

635
00:58:24,666 --> 00:58:26,956
-No, I'm good.
-What are you afraid of?

636
00:58:28,166 --> 00:58:30,416
-It's cold.
-Serious question:

637
00:58:32,166 --> 00:58:33,916
what are you most afraid of?

638
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:39,000
Dying.

639
00:58:40,625 --> 00:58:41,745
I don't believe that.

640
00:58:44,583 --> 00:58:45,833
Being ordinary.

641
00:58:48,875 --> 00:58:50,285
So, don't be ordinary.

642
01:00:02,833 --> 01:00:04,333
Oh, my God!

643
01:00:04,500 --> 01:00:06,420
- Oh. OK!

644
01:00:06,875 --> 01:00:09,825
-Oh, you're right. Fucking freezing!
- Oh, my God!

645
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:11,290
OK, let's go under.

646
01:00:11,375 --> 01:00:12,785
-Yeah?
-OK.

647
01:00:12,875 --> 01:00:15,625
One, two, three.

648
01:00:47,583 --> 01:00:48,883
Marco!

649
01:00:51,250 --> 01:00:52,830
Polo!

650
01:01:02,416 --> 01:01:04,166
So, what are<i> you</i> most afraid of?

651
01:01:08,583 --> 01:01:09,713
Uh...

652
01:01:15,500 --> 01:01:18,500
I don't know. I guess losing my sister.

653
01:01:19,416 --> 01:01:20,876
My mom's gone a lot.

654
01:01:20,958 --> 01:01:22,418
My dad left a while ago.

655
01:01:23,083 --> 01:01:24,253
New town, new family.

656
01:01:25,708 --> 01:01:29,248
So, Kate's basically all I have.

657
01:01:38,875 --> 01:01:39,915
How'd you get that?

658
01:01:47,791 --> 01:01:49,631
I'm going in search of the bottom.

659
01:02:25,166 --> 01:02:26,206
Finch?

660
01:02:35,041 --> 01:02:36,001
Finch!

661
01:02:47,916 --> 01:02:48,876
Finch!

662
01:03:17,208 --> 01:03:18,078
Asshole!

663
01:03:18,916 --> 01:03:19,786
What?

664
01:03:20,583 --> 01:03:22,753
Do you know how scared I was?

665
01:03:23,541 --> 01:03:24,461
Hey.

666
01:03:24,541 --> 01:03:26,921
Hey, Violet. Violet, I'm sorry!

667
01:03:32,333 --> 01:03:33,713
Violet, I'm sorry.

668
01:03:35,041 --> 01:03:35,881
Violet!

669
01:03:36,875 --> 01:03:38,455
I thought you drowned!

670
01:03:40,208 --> 01:03:42,628
I'm sorry. Hey, I'm sorry.

671
01:03:42,708 --> 01:03:45,168
I didn't... I didn't mean to scare you.

672
01:03:45,583 --> 01:03:46,633
Well, you did.

673
01:03:47,125 --> 01:03:49,955
That was the last thing
that I wanted to do.

674
01:03:51,500 --> 01:03:53,290
Where do you go when you disappear?

675
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,130
Tell me something real about you.

676
01:04:06,208 --> 01:04:07,328
Or I'm leaving.

677
01:04:07,916 --> 01:04:09,036
OK.

678
01:04:10,500 --> 01:04:14,000
Sometimes I have to go to places
that make me feel like myself.

679
01:04:14,083 --> 01:04:18,543
I need to do things that remind me
that I'm in control.

680
01:04:26,875 --> 01:04:28,125
My dad used to...

681
01:04:29,708 --> 01:04:31,208
get in these dark moods.

682
01:04:37,875 --> 01:04:39,205
Did he do that to you?

683
01:04:43,958 --> 01:04:45,668
I used to be a lot smaller.

684
01:04:50,458 --> 01:04:52,788
I used to not know
how to get out of the way.

685
01:04:59,750 --> 01:05:01,540
People don't like messy, right?

686
01:05:50,125 --> 01:05:51,705
- Uh...
- Yeah.

687
01:05:51,791 --> 01:05:54,211
-Oh, wait. Yeah, you got it.
-I know, I had it!

705

01:08:27,875 --> 01:08:29,915
I'm so... I'm so sorry.

709
01:08:30,833 --> 01:08:32,923
It was my fault. I fucked up.

710
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:36,710
Please, just don't blame her. Please.
I'm sorry.

711
01:08:36,791 --> 01:08:38,921
Just... go home.

712
01:09:43,083 --> 01:09:44,463
Do you have any clue

713
01:09:45,583 --> 01:09:48,923
what horrible situations we had you in,
in our heads?

714
01:09:50,666 --> 01:09:53,576
You have to understand how that felt,

715
01:09:54,375 --> 01:09:56,785
your dad and I not knowing where you were.

716
01:09:58,750 --> 01:10:00,170
I said I was sorry.

717
01:10:00,958 --> 01:10:02,878
But you didn't have to treat Finch
like that.

718
01:10:02,958 --> 01:10:05,828
Well, he's the boy
that kept our daughter out all night.

719
01:10:07,041 --> 01:10:09,131
I kept him out all night, too, Mom.

720
01:11:42,041 --> 01:11:42,881
Hey.

721
01:11:43,250 --> 01:11:45,500
Hey, V. Hey, what's up?

722
01:11:46,250 --> 01:11:47,170
How are you?

723
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:49,960
-Fine.
-It's been a minute. What's been going on?

724
01:11:50,041 --> 01:11:51,501
I can't deal with you right now.

725
01:11:52,833 --> 01:11:54,133
Is everything OK?

726
01:11:54,916 --> 01:11:56,666
Honestly, I don't know.

727
01:11:58,708 --> 01:12:00,038
I'm not tryin' to be an asshole,

728
01:12:00,125 --> 01:12:01,875
but you should know
what you're getting into.

729
01:12:03,333 --> 01:12:05,383
-I do.
-No, you don't.

730
01:12:05,458 --> 01:12:06,458
-He--
-Let's go.

731
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:09,330
-Where've you been?
-You know why she's hangin' out with you?

732
01:12:09,416 --> 01:12:10,496
She's tryin' to fix you.

733
01:12:10,583 --> 01:12:12,923
Shut up, Roamer! Just...

734
01:12:13,083 --> 01:12:16,333
You have no idea
who he really is, do you? He's a freak!

735
01:12:17,583 --> 01:12:19,963
-Call me a freak one more time.
-You're a fuckin' freak.

736
01:12:23,041 --> 01:12:23,961
Finch!

737
01:12:24,291 --> 01:12:25,131
Finch!

738
01:12:25,208 --> 01:12:26,208
Stop!

739
01:12:27,041 --> 01:12:28,001
Finch!

740
01:12:30,125 --> 01:12:32,245
Finch! Yo, let him go, man. Get off him.

741
01:12:33,791 --> 01:12:35,921
Finch, stop! Stop!

742
01:12:40,833 --> 01:12:42,003
Oh, my God!

743
01:12:42,083 --> 01:12:44,293
What the hell?
He almost killed him.

744
01:12:56,583 --> 01:12:57,753
He's crazy.

745
01:13:16,875 --> 01:13:17,705
Fuck!

746
01:13:18,875 --> 01:13:20,625
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

747
01:13:37,083 --> 01:13:37,963
Anything?

748
01:13:42,541 --> 01:13:43,921
Guess he's gone again.

749
01:13:47,916 --> 01:13:50,076
I've been friends with the guy
since minute one,

750
01:13:51,250 --> 01:13:53,330
and I haven't waited
for his call in years.

751
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:54,960
He just...

752
01:13:56,541 --> 01:13:58,461
gets in this mood sometimes, and...

753
01:13:59,583 --> 01:14:01,753
it's hard, you know?

754
01:14:03,750 --> 01:14:04,830
He's not easy,

755
01:14:06,166 --> 01:14:08,876
and everybody who gets close to him
gets burned out.

756
01:14:12,750 --> 01:14:14,290
So, why do you stick around?

757
01:14:19,666 --> 01:14:20,746
Because...

758
01:14:23,916 --> 01:14:24,916
'cause I love him.

759
01:14:26,875 --> 01:14:30,035
He thinks everybody leaves him
and I won't do that.

760
01:14:32,208 --> 01:14:33,628
This is what we do.

761
01:14:34,333 --> 01:14:37,883
I'm gonna get mad,
he's gonna come back and apologize,

762
01:14:37,958 --> 01:14:40,038
and it'll be like it never even happened.

763
01:14:51,958 --> 01:14:52,958
Hey.

764
01:14:54,083 --> 01:14:55,963
Is... is Finch here?

765
01:14:56,958 --> 01:14:58,248
Did something happen?

766
01:15:00,958 --> 01:15:02,168
Yeah, come on in.

767
01:15:06,250 --> 01:15:07,380
I'm Lindsay.

768
01:15:07,458 --> 01:15:11,828
Um... I'm OCD and just got diagnosed
with a social anxiety disorder,

769
01:15:11,916 --> 01:15:14,666
so being here with everyone
is not intimidating at all.

770
01:15:17,208 --> 01:15:19,458
Last year, I started cutting myself.

771
01:15:20,625 --> 01:15:23,995
I still deal with it, but I'm here.

772
01:15:25,250 --> 01:15:26,750
I'm so sorry.

773
01:15:26,833 --> 01:15:28,133
No worries. Have a seat.

774
01:15:32,666 --> 01:15:34,286
Hi, I'm Bradley.

775
01:15:34,375 --> 01:15:40,995
Um... I am ADHD, OCD,
BPD, DID, and bipolar.

776
01:15:41,541 --> 01:15:42,501
Yeah.

777
01:15:42,833 --> 01:15:46,463
Um... you'd think some of those
would cancel the others out, but...

778
01:15:47,041 --> 01:15:48,671
Yeah, my week's been OK.

779
01:15:48,750 --> 01:15:50,920
I've been watching
a lot of basketball lately,

780
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:53,290
and that's been helping a lot, so...

781
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:54,830
Good.

782
01:15:56,458 --> 01:15:57,918
Hi. Welcome.

783
01:16:01,875 --> 01:16:02,875
Um...

784
01:16:05,041 --> 01:16:07,671
I'm, uh... Theodore Finch.

785
01:16:09,791 --> 01:16:10,831
No labels.

786
01:16:12,583 --> 01:16:16,133
Not really sure why I'm here.

787
01:16:17,166 --> 01:16:18,126
Uh...

788
01:16:20,291 --> 01:16:25,041
I guess it's 'cause I...
I got in this fight at school and,

789
01:16:26,500 --> 01:16:27,540
like,

790
01:16:28,875 --> 01:16:31,535
I was there, but I wasn't there.

791
01:16:31,625 --> 01:16:33,625
I was watchin' myself, and...

792
01:16:37,875 --> 01:16:38,825
uh...

793
01:16:39,458 --> 01:16:41,828
I-I-I just get a little lost sometimes.

794
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:47,330
I run... a lot.

795
01:16:48,041 --> 01:16:49,461
Sometimes that helps.

796
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:52,000
Kind of.

797
01:16:56,250 --> 01:16:57,710
I don't know. Is that enough?

798
01:16:58,666 --> 01:16:59,536
Sure.

799
01:17:00,125 --> 01:17:01,745
Thanks. Glad you're here.

800
01:17:05,458 --> 01:17:07,828
Amanda, why don't you go ahead?

801
01:17:10,166 --> 01:17:11,246
I'm Amanda.

802
01:17:13,750 --> 01:17:14,790
I'm bulimic.

803
01:17:16,291 --> 01:17:18,131
I've tried to kill myself twice.

804
01:17:21,375 --> 01:17:23,285
I think about it almost every day.

805
01:17:39,416 --> 01:17:41,416
Hey, have you heard anything yet?

806
01:17:42,125 --> 01:17:44,325
-No.
- OK.

807
01:17:45,458 --> 01:17:48,418
I gotta go to work. I'm gonna be late.
But you should stay.

808
01:17:49,333 --> 01:17:50,753
Why does he keep doing this?

809
01:17:54,625 --> 01:17:55,705
I don't know.

810
01:18:00,041 --> 01:18:02,251
Have him call me
when you hear from him, OK?

811
01:18:04,041 --> 01:18:04,881
Yeah.

812
01:18:05,291 --> 01:18:06,581
- Bye.
-Bye.

813
01:18:12,208 --> 01:18:14,288
<i>I heard you beat the shit outta Roamer.</i>

814
01:18:16,583 --> 01:18:18,083
Why do you keep doing stuff like that?

815
01:18:18,166 --> 01:18:20,536
Aren't you tired of people
talking about you all the time?

816
01:18:22,166 --> 01:18:23,916
People are always gonna talk.

817
01:18:24,916 --> 01:18:26,166
It's their specialty.

818
01:18:29,583 --> 01:18:30,583
Are you OK?

819
01:18:34,125 --> 01:18:37,665
I don't know.
I feel like I keep messing things up,

820
01:18:37,750 --> 01:18:42,170
and I'm not sure
I know how to not do that.

821
01:18:42,625 --> 01:18:43,625
Does this work?

822
01:18:45,666 --> 01:18:47,456
It's better than the alternative.

823
01:19:35,333 --> 01:19:37,253
<i>Your girlfriend's pretty worried</i>
<i>about you.</i>

824
01:19:37,708 --> 01:19:39,628
She's been at the house all afternoon.

825
01:19:43,041 --> 01:19:44,041
What's going on?

826
01:19:49,083 --> 01:19:52,173
I don't... really remember...

827
01:19:53,125 --> 01:19:55,245
Dad that well.

828
01:19:56,833 --> 01:19:58,713
And everything I do...

829
01:20:01,041 --> 01:20:03,461
remember is... is bad.

830
01:20:07,208 --> 01:20:08,378
Are there any...

831
01:20:09,583 --> 01:20:11,753
good memories you have of him?

832
01:20:14,833 --> 01:20:17,923
Well, the fact that he would
beat the shit out of us

833
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:19,830
kind of negated all the good times.

834
01:20:26,916 --> 01:20:29,496
But why was he like that?

835
01:20:29,583 --> 01:20:32,333
Was he like that because of us? Was he...

836
01:20:33,583 --> 01:20:34,883
like that because of Mom?

837
01:20:34,958 --> 01:20:37,378
He was like that
because he was a shitty person.

838
01:20:37,833 --> 01:20:39,833
There has to be a reason, though.

839
01:20:39,916 --> 01:20:42,996
Because if there's a reason,
then he could get better.

840
01:20:43,083 --> 01:20:44,173
Something or...

841
01:20:45,500 --> 01:20:48,420
someone could make him better, right?

842
01:20:48,875 --> 01:20:51,875
I don't know. Who cares?
Dude, he's someone else's problem.

843
01:20:51,958 --> 01:20:53,998
Why are you asking me about Dad?

844
01:20:57,875 --> 01:20:59,285
What's going on, Finch?

845
01:21:03,541 --> 01:21:05,461
Come on. You can talk to me, man.

846
01:21:08,333 --> 01:21:10,133
Nothing, Kate.

847
01:21:10,208 --> 01:21:11,288
Sorry. Nothing.

848
01:21:12,666 --> 01:21:13,666
I'm good.

849
01:21:14,458 --> 01:21:16,918
Are you sure?
Because I have to open the bar,

850
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:20,750
-but I can find someone to cover me.
-I'm good.

851
01:21:24,750 --> 01:21:26,500
You know I love you, right, Theo?

852
01:21:29,750 --> 01:21:30,670
I know.

853
01:22:13,791 --> 01:22:14,881
You scared me.

854
01:22:21,458 --> 01:22:22,918
What is all of this?

855
01:22:25,583 --> 01:22:27,253
I'm trying to focus.

856
01:22:28,250 --> 01:22:29,580
Focus on what?

857
01:22:30,916 --> 01:22:32,286
On staying awake.

858
01:22:34,916 --> 01:22:36,996
I don't understand what that means.

859
01:22:38,708 --> 01:22:40,168
Sometimes I...

860
01:22:41,125 --> 01:22:42,325
go blank.

861
01:22:44,166 --> 01:22:46,876
I... get into these dark moods.

862
01:22:48,041 --> 01:22:50,671
I think too fast
to keep track of anything,

863
01:22:51,750 --> 01:22:53,040
and then it's like...

864
01:22:54,208 --> 01:22:57,038
all my thoughts are gone at once.

865
01:22:58,458 --> 01:23:01,788
And sometimes,
if I put 'em up there, I can...

866
01:23:02,208 --> 01:23:04,328
focus and slow down, but...

867
01:23:07,291 --> 01:23:09,791
I can't right now. I can't.

868
01:23:11,958 --> 01:23:12,958
OK.

869
01:23:14,125 --> 01:23:15,915
And this usually works.

870
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:17,790
Maybe there's too much clutter.

871
01:23:21,333 --> 01:23:23,713
I can fix it. I just...

872
01:23:24,083 --> 01:23:27,003
I just need time to figure this out.

873
01:23:30,291 --> 01:23:33,291
- I'm trying to help you.
-I don't need your help!

874
01:23:33,833 --> 01:23:36,543
This is on me! This isn't about you!

875
01:23:38,833 --> 01:23:40,713
You need to tell me what's wrong.

876
01:23:44,375 --> 01:23:45,455
You don't get it.

877
01:23:51,583 --> 01:23:52,673
You're right.

878
01:23:53,833 --> 01:23:55,083
I don't get it.

879
01:23:58,416 --> 01:24:00,036
Don't you know, Violet?

880
01:24:03,666 --> 01:24:04,876
I'm "The Freak."

881
01:24:08,916 --> 01:24:10,286
I'm fucked up!

882
01:24:22,875 --> 01:24:23,995
I need you to leave.

883
01:24:29,916 --> 01:24:30,876
Go!

884
01:25:39,458 --> 01:25:41,708
<i>Hey, it's Finch. Leave a message.</i>

885
01:25:43,666 --> 01:25:45,376
Hey, Finch. Um...

886
01:25:47,750 --> 01:25:49,250
I'm sorry.

887
01:25:50,250 --> 01:25:51,830
I'm just sorry that I pushed.

888
01:25:51,916 --> 01:25:53,666
And... I...

889
01:25:54,916 --> 01:25:56,666
just need you to come back.

890
01:26:00,958 --> 01:26:03,498
I just really need you to come back, OK?

891
01:26:30,750 --> 01:26:31,920
Hey, kiddo.

892
01:26:32,750 --> 01:26:33,630
Hey.

893
01:26:39,875 --> 01:26:40,825
Dad?

894
01:26:43,333 --> 01:26:44,173
Yeah?

895
01:26:48,041 --> 01:26:49,501
On Eleanor's birthday...

896
01:26:53,958 --> 01:26:54,878
I...

897
01:26:57,833 --> 01:26:59,253
I wasn't really thinking.

898
01:27:04,791 --> 01:27:06,711
I found myself at the bridge.

899
01:27:10,666 --> 01:27:12,416
I was standing on a ledge.

900
01:27:16,875 --> 01:27:18,575
That's how I met Finch.

901
01:27:19,666 --> 01:27:20,956
He found me there.

902
01:27:25,666 --> 01:27:26,876
He saved me.

903
01:27:29,916 --> 01:27:31,206
You... you weren't gonna...

904
01:27:31,666 --> 01:27:32,666
I'm OK.

905
01:27:35,958 --> 01:27:36,958
I was...

906
01:27:38,166 --> 01:27:39,036
confused.

907
01:27:41,458 --> 01:27:42,538
I was sad.

908
01:27:45,458 --> 01:27:46,458
I'm OK.

909
01:27:50,333 --> 01:27:51,463
I'm better now.

910
01:27:54,916 --> 01:27:55,746
Wow.

911
01:27:57,958 --> 01:27:59,998
Well, I'm glad Finch was there.

912
01:28:02,875 --> 01:28:03,875
Me too.

913
01:28:09,625 --> 01:28:11,745
I just wish I knew where he was.

914
01:28:14,750 --> 01:28:15,670
Well...

915
01:28:18,583 --> 01:28:20,713
you two have been a lot of places.

916
01:28:21,833 --> 01:28:23,883
Is there any place else he might go?

917
01:29:54,500 --> 01:29:55,670
Finch!

918
01:30:00,958 --> 01:30:01,998
Finch!

919
01:30:05,625 --> 01:30:06,665
Finch.

920
01:30:34,458 --> 01:30:36,418
Marco!

921
01:31:54,583 --> 01:31:56,543
On behalf of Finch's family,

922
01:31:56,625 --> 01:31:58,995
I wanna thank you all
for being here today.

923
01:31:59,500 --> 01:32:03,750
We've gathered to celebrate
and to honor the memory of one

924
01:32:03,833 --> 01:32:07,883
who will be incredibly missed
because he has been so dearly loved.

925
01:32:08,625 --> 01:32:10,535
The events of these past few days...

926
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:48,250
I'm gonna say bye.

927
01:32:48,333 --> 01:32:49,883
OK, we'll wait for you.

928
01:32:53,166 --> 01:32:54,126
Hey.

929
01:33:16,041 --> 01:33:17,541
I should've been there.

930
01:33:32,500 --> 01:33:33,630
I miss him.

931
01:33:37,458 --> 01:33:39,498
Just so fucked.

932
01:33:52,791 --> 01:33:54,131
I had no idea.

933
01:33:59,083 --> 01:34:01,043
Sorry that I wasn't there for you.

934
01:34:04,125 --> 01:34:05,125
It's OK.

935
01:34:07,375 --> 01:34:08,875
I didn't know how to tell you.

936
01:34:14,208 --> 01:34:15,378
I would miss you.

937
01:34:20,125 --> 01:34:21,825
Yeah, I know you would.

938
01:36:05,583 --> 01:36:07,753
"Travelers' Prayer Chapel,

939
01:36:10,083 --> 01:36:11,463
created as a sanctuary

940
01:36:11,541 --> 01:36:15,211
for the weary travelers
to stop and rest along their way.

941
01:36:16,500 --> 01:36:18,380
It was built in memoriam to those

942
01:36:18,458 --> 01:36:21,208
who have lost their lives
in auto accidents...

943
01:36:26,041 --> 01:36:27,921
and as a place for healing.

944
01:36:32,208 --> 01:36:34,828
We remember those who are no longer here,

945
01:36:35,583 --> 01:36:37,793
who were taken from us too soon,

946
01:36:37,875 --> 01:36:40,325
and who we will always keep
in our hearts."

947
01:37:31,291 --> 01:37:33,331
<i>I used to be worried</i>
<i>about everything.</i>

948
01:37:36,333 --> 01:37:38,043
<i>Things that seemed meaningful...</i>

949
01:37:39,375 --> 01:37:40,995
were actually meaningless.

950
01:37:42,166 --> 01:37:43,576
I worried about life.

951
01:37:47,041 --> 01:37:50,041
I worried about what would happen
if I let myself feel again.

952
01:37:52,583 --> 01:37:54,173
I thought I didn't deserve to.

953
01:38:01,291 --> 01:38:02,171
Then...

954
01:38:03,625 --> 01:38:05,165
without really knowing...

955
01:38:09,500 --> 01:38:10,580
I changed.

956
01:38:15,333 --> 01:38:18,883
I wasn't worried
about what would happen if I lived.

957
01:38:20,958 --> 01:38:23,288
I was worried about
what would happen if I didn't.

958
01:38:25,625 --> 01:38:26,955
What I would miss.

959
01:38:28,833 --> 01:38:30,713
I worried about not remembering.

960
01:38:32,125 --> 01:38:34,325
Not remembering all of the moments...

961
01:38:39,500 --> 01:38:41,540
all of the places...

962
01:38:46,416 --> 01:38:48,166
...and that's because of Finch.

963
01:38:52,958 --> 01:38:54,828
Because he taught me to wander.

964
01:39:00,166 --> 01:39:03,166
<i>He taught me</i>
<i>that you don't have to climb a mountain</i>

965
01:39:03,250 --> 01:39:05,000
<i>to stand on top of the world.</i>

966
01:39:09,208 --> 01:39:13,878
<i>That even the ugliest of places</i>
<i>can be beautiful,</i>

967
01:39:14,750 --> 01:39:16,670
<i>as long as you take the time to look.</i>

968
01:39:25,166 --> 01:39:27,036
<i>That it's OK to get lost...</i>

969
01:39:31,083 --> 01:39:32,923
<i>as long as you find your way back.</i>

970
01:39:40,291 --> 01:39:41,831
<i>But in learning all of that,</i>

971
01:39:42,833 --> 01:39:45,173
<i>I missed seeing</i>
<i>something more important...</i>

972
01:39:48,625 --> 01:39:49,785
<i>seeing Finch.</i>

973
01:39:53,416 --> 01:39:54,996
<i>I missed that he was in pain.</i>

974
01:40:03,708 --> 01:40:06,288
<i>I missed that he was teaching me</i>
<i>all along</i>

975
01:40:07,541 --> 01:40:08,751
<i>how to move on.</i>

976
01:40:14,125 --> 01:40:15,575
<i>Finch was a dreamer.</i>

977
01:40:18,708 --> 01:40:20,458
<i>He dreamt while he was awake.</i>

978
01:40:23,958 --> 01:40:28,128
<i>He dreamt of all the beauty in the world,</i>
<i>and he made it come to life.</i>

979
01:40:33,166 --> 01:40:38,576
Finch taught me that there's beauty
in the most unexpected of places.

980
01:40:44,125 --> 01:40:45,995
And that there are bright places,

981
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:49,500
even in dark times.

982
01:40:58,041 --> 01:40:59,461
And that if there isn't...

983
01:41:02,708 --> 01:41:04,748
you can be that bright place...

984
01:41:06,583 --> 01:41:08,963
