01:15:20,625 --> 01:15:23,995
I still deal with it, but I'm here.

880
01:15:25,250 --> 01:15:26,750
I'm so sorry.

881
01:15:26,833 --> 01:15:28,133
No worries. Have a seat.

882
01:15:32,666 --> 01:15:34,286
[boy] Hi, I'm Bradley.

883
01:15:34,375 --> 01:15:40,995
Um... I am ADHD, OCD,
BPD, DID, and bipolar.

884
01:15:41,541 --> 01:15:42,501
Yeah. [chuckles]

885
01:15:42,833 --> 01:15:46,463
Um... you'd think some of those
would cancel the others out, but...

886
01:15:47,041 --> 01:15:48,671
Yeah, my week's been OK.

887
01:15:48,750 --> 01:15:50,920
I've been watching
a lot of basketball lately,

888
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:53,290
and that's been helping a lot, so...

889
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:54,830
Good.

890
01:15:56,458 --> 01:15:57,918
Hi. Welcome.

891
01:16:01,875 --> 01:16:02,875
Um...

892
01:16:05,041 --> 01:16:07,671
I'm, uh... Theodore Finch.

893
01:16:09,791 --> 01:16:10,831
No labels.

894
01:16:12,583 --> 01:16:16,133
Not really sure why I'm here.
[chuckles lightly]

895
01:16:17,166 --> 01:16:18,126
Uh...

896
01:16:20,291 --> 01:16:25,041
I guess it's 'cause I...
I got in this fight at school and,

897
01:16:26,500 --> 01:16:27,540
like,

898
01:16:28,875 --> 01:16:31,535
I was there, but I wasn't there.

899
01:16:31,625 --> 01:16:33,625
I was watchin' myself, and...

900
01:16:37,875 --> 01:16:38,825
uh...

901
01:16:39,458 --> 01:16:41,828
I-I-I just get a little lost sometimes.

902
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:47,330
I run... a lot.

903
01:16:48,041 --> 01:16:49,461
Sometimes that helps.

904
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:52,000
Kind of.

905
01:16:56,250 --> 01:16:57,710
I don't know. Is that enough?

906
01:16:58,666 --> 01:16:59,536
Sure.

907
01:17:00,125 --> 01:17:01,745
Thanks. Glad you're here.

908
01:17:05,458 --> 01:17:07,828
Amanda, why don't you go ahead?

909
01:17:10,166 --> 01:17:11,246
I'm Amanda.

910
01:17:13,750 --> 01:17:14,790
I'm bulimic.

911
01:17:16,291 --> 01:17:18,131
I've tried to kill myself twice.

912
01:17:21,375 --> 01:17:23,285
I think about it almost every day.

913
01:17:37,166 --> 01:17:38,876
[footsteps approaching]

914
01:17:39,416 --> 01:17:41,416
[Kate] Hey, have you heard anything yet?

915
01:17:42,125 --> 01:17:44,325
-No.
-[Kate sighs] OK.

916
01:17:45,458 --> 01:17:48,418
I gotta go to work. I'm gonna be late.
But you should stay.

917
01:17:49,333 --> 01:17:50,753
Why does he keep doing this?

918
01:17:54,625 --> 01:17:55,705
I don't know.

919
01:18:00,041 --> 01:18:02,251
Have him call me
when you hear from him, OK?

920
01:18:04,041 --> 01:18:04,881
Yeah.

921
01:18:05,291 --> 01:18:06,581
-[Kate] Bye.
-Bye.

922
01:18:06,708 --> 01:18:08,708
[footsteps receding]

923
01:18:12,208 --> 01:18:14,288
[Amanda]
<i>I heard you beat the shit outta Roamer.</i>

924
01:18:16,583 --> 01:18:18,083
Why do you keep doing stuff like that?

925
01:18:18,166 --> 01:18:20,536
Aren't you tired of people
talking about you all the time?

926
01:18:22,166 --> 01:18:23,916
People are always gonna talk.

927
01:18:24,916 --> 01:18:26,166
It's their specialty.

928
01:18:29,583 --> 01:18:30,583
Are you OK?

929
01:18:34,125 --> 01:18:37,665
I don't know.
I feel like I keep messing things up,

930
01:18:37,750 --> 01:18:42,170
and I'm not sure
I know how to not do that.

931
01:18:42,625 --> 01:18:43,625
Does this work?

932
01:18:45,666 --> 01:18:47,456
It's better than the alternative.

933
01:18:54,500 --> 01:18:56,000
[knocking on door]

934
01:19:35,333 --> 01:19:37,253
[Kate] <i>Your girlfriend's pretty worried</i>
<i>about you.</i>

935
01:19:37,708 --> 01:19:39,628
She's been at the house all afternoon.

936
01:19:43,041 --> 01:19:44,041
What's going on?

937
01:19:49,083 --> 01:19:52,173
I don't... really remember...

938
01:19:53,125 --> 01:19:55,245
Dad that well.

939
01:19:56,833 --> 01:19:58,713
And everything I do...

940
01:20:01,041 --> 01:20:03,461
remember is... is bad.

941
01:20:07,208 --> 01:20:08,378
Are there any...

942
01:20:09,583 --> 01:20:11,753
good memories you have of him?

943
01:20:12,791 --> 01:20:13,831
[Kate sighs]

944
01:20:14,833 --> 01:20:17,923
Well, the fact that he would
beat the shit out of us

945
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:19,830
kind of negated all the good times.

946
01:20:26,916 --> 01:20:29,496
But why was he like that?

947
01:20:29,583 --> 01:20:32,333
Was he like that because of us? Was he...

948
01:20:33,583 --> 01:20:34,883
like that because of Mom?

949
01:20:34,958 --> 01:20:37,378
He was like that
because he was a shitty person.

950
01:20:37,833 --> 01:20:39,833
[Finch] There has to be a reason, though.

951
01:20:39,916 --> 01:20:42,996
Because if there's a reason,
then he could get better.

952
01:20:43,083 --> 01:20:44,173
Something or...

953
01:20:45,500 --> 01:20:48,420
someone could make him better, right?

954
01:20:48,875 --> 01:20:51,875
I don't know. Who cares?
Dude, he's someone else's problem.

955
01:20:51,958 --> 01:20:53,998
Why are you asking me about Dad?

956
01:20:57,875 --> 01:20:59,285
What's going on, Finch?

957
01:21:03,541 --> 01:21:05,461
Come on. You can talk to me, man.

958
01:21:08,333 --> 01:21:10,133
Nothing, Kate.

959
01:21:10,208 --> 01:21:11,288
Sorry. Nothing.

960
01:21:12,666 --> 01:21:13,666
I'm good.

961
01:21:14,458 --> 01:21:16,918
Are you sure?
Because I have to open the bar,

962
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:20,750
-but I can find someone to cover me.
-I'm good. [chuckles]

963
01:21:24,750 --> 01:21:26,500
You know I love you, right, Theo?

964
01:21:29,750 --> 01:21:30,670
I know.

965
01:21:47,208 --> 01:21:48,208
[door opens]

966
01:21:52,958 --> 01:21:54,418
[footsteps approaching]

967
01:22:13,791 --> 01:22:14,881
You scared me.

968
01:22:21,458 --> 01:22:22,918
What is all of this?

969
01:22:25,583 --> 01:22:27,253
[Finch] I'm trying to focus.

970
01:22:28,250 --> 01:22:29,580
[Violet] Focus on what?

971
01:22:30,916 --> 01:22:32,286
On staying awake.

972
01:22:34,916 --> 01:22:36,996
I don't understand what that means.

973
01:22:38,708 --> 01:22:40,168
Sometimes I...

974
01:22:41,125 --> 01:22:42,325
go blank.

975
01:22:44,166 --> 01:22:46,876
I... get into these dark moods.

976
01:22:48,041 --> 01:22:50,671
I think too fast
to keep track of anything,

977
01:22:51,750 --> 01:22:53,040
and then it's like...

978
01:22:54,208 --> 01:22:57,038
all my thoughts are gone at once.

979
01:22:58,458 --> 01:23:01,788
And sometimes,
if I put 'em up there, I can...

980
01:23:02,208 --> 01:23:04,328
focus and slow down, but...

981
01:23:07,291 --> 01:23:09,791
I can't right now. I can't.

982
01:23:11,958 --> 01:23:12,958
OK.

983
01:23:14,125 --> 01:23:15,915
[Finch] And this usually works.

984
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:17,790
Maybe there's too much clutter.

985
01:23:21,333 --> 01:23:23,713
I can fix it. I just...

986
01:23:24,083 --> 01:23:27,003
I just need time to figure this out.

987
01:23:30,291 --> 01:23:33,291
-[Violet] I'm trying to help you.
-I don't need your help!

988
01:23:33,833 --> 01:23:36,543
This is on me! This isn't about you!

989
01:23:38,833 --> 01:23:40,713
You need to tell me what's wrong.

990
01:23:44,375 --> 01:23:45,455
You don't get it.

991
01:23:48,083 --> 01:23:49,583
[sobbing]

992
01:23:51,583 --> 01:23:52,673
You're right.

993
01:23:53,833 --> 01:23:55,083
I don't get it.

994
01:23:58,416 --> 01:24:00,036
Don't you know, Violet?

995
01:24:03,666 --> 01:24:04,876
I'm "The Freak."

996
01:24:08,916 --> 01:24:10,286
I'm fucked up!

997
01:24:22,875 --> 01:24:23,995
I need you to leave.

998
01:24:29,916 --> 01:24:30,876
Go!

999
01:24:33,875 --> 01:24:35,375
[footsteps receding]

1000
01:24:39,750 --> 01:24:40,960
[door opens]

1001
01:24:42,041 --> 01:24:43,041
[door closes]

1002
01:25:00,375 --> 01:25:01,745
[birds chirping]

1003

[indistinct chattering]

1005

[voicemail]
<i>Hey, it's Finch. Leave a message.</i>

1007
01:25:41,791 --> 01:25:43,581
-[Violet sobbing]
-[voicemail beeps]

1008
01:25:43,666 --> 01:25:45,376
Hey, Finch. Um... [sobs]

1009
01:25:47,750 --> 01:25:49,250
I'm sorry.

1010
01:25:50,250 --> 01:25:51,830
I'm just sorry that I pushed.

1011
01:25:51,916 --> 01:25:53,666
And... I...

1012
01:25:54,916 --> 01:25:56,666
just need you to come back.

1013
01:26:00,958 --> 01:26:03,498
I just really need you to come back, OK?

1014
01:26:09,708 --> 01:26:11,708
[breathing heavily]

1015
01:26:30,750 --> 01:26:31,920
Hey, kiddo.

1016
01:26:32,750 --> 01:26:33,630
Hey.

1017
01:26:39,875 --> 01:26:40,825
Dad?

1018
01:26:43,333 --> 01:26:44,173
Yeah?

1019
01:26:48,041 --> 01:26:49,501
On Eleanor's birthday...

1020
01:26:53,958 --> 01:26:54,878
I...

1021
01:26:57,833 --> 01:26:59,253
I wasn't really thinking.

1022
01:27:04,791 --> 01:27:06,711
I found myself at the bridge.

1023
01:27:10,666 --> 01:27:12,416
I was standing on a ledge.

1024
01:27:16,875 --> 01:27:18,575
That's how I met Finch.

1025
01:27:19,666 --> 01:27:20,956
He found me there.

1026
01:27:25,666 --> 01:27:26,876
He saved me.

1027
01:27:29,916 --> 01:27:31,206
You... you weren't gonna...

1028
01:27:31,666 --> 01:27:32,666
I'm OK.

1029
01:27:35,958 --> 01:27:36,958
I was...

1030
01:27:38,166 --> 01:27:39,036
confused.

1031
01:27:41,458 --> 01:27:42,538
I was sad.

1032
01:27:45,458 --> 01:27:46,458
I'm OK.

1033
01:27:50,333 --> 01:27:51,463
I'm better now.

1034
01:27:54,916 --> 01:27:55,746
Wow.

1035
01:27:57,958 --> 01:27:59,998
Well, I'm glad Finch was there.

1036
01:28:02,875 --> 01:28:03,875
Me too.

1037
01:28:09,625 --> 01:28:11,745
[Violet] I just wish I knew where he was.

1038
01:28:14,750 --> 01:28:15,670
Well...

1039
01:28:18,583 --> 01:28:20,713
you two have been a lot of places.

1040
01:28:21,833 --> 01:28:23,883
Is there any place else he might go?

1041
01:28:42,375 --> 01:28:43,495
[buckles seat belt]

1042
01:28:44,541 --> 01:28:45,631

[panicked breathing]

1047
01:29:54,500 --> 01:29:55,670
Finch!

1048
01:29:56,041 --> 01:29:57,711
[panicked breathing]

1049
01:30:00,958 --> 01:30:01,998
Finch!

1050
01:30:05,625 --> 01:30:06,665
Finch.

1051
01:30:06,750 --> 01:30:08,080
[panicked breathing]

1052

[Violet sobbing]

1053
01:30:34,458 --> 01:30:36,418
Marco!

[strained sobbing]

1056
01:31:54,583 --> 01:31:56,543
[man] On behalf of Finch's family,

1057
01:31:56,625 --> 01:31:58,995
I wanna thank you all
for being here today.

1058
01:31:59,500 --> 01:32:03,750
We've gathered to celebrate
and to honor the memory of one

1059
01:32:03,833 --> 01:32:07,883
who will be incredibly missed
