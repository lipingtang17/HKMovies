不關你的事
{\fs12}Nothing to do with you.

00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:25,874
那個人是你抓的？
{\fs12}Did you get him?

70
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,949
他的傷痕不像是你做的
{\fs12}It doesn't seems that you did it

71
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:34,196
用不著你管，總之我把犯人抓回來
完成任務不就行了
{\fs12}Whatever,anyway,I got him,and my job is done.

72
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:40,037

就抓回這麼兩個瘦排骨？
{\fs12}Just these two skinny ones?

75
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,353
總比沒有好啊
{\fs12}It's better than nothing.

76
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:51,233
把他們帶回去煮湯啦！
{\fs12}Bring them back and make the soup!

77
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,439
你就是春十三少嗎？

他很帥吧？

你憑什麼教訓我？沒大沒小
{\fs12}How dare you say that to me?You need to respect.

129
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:39,075
沒大沒小的人是你！
{\fs12}You are the one with no respect!

130
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:41,998
你是玄機使，你就要聽我的命令！
{\fs12}You XuanJi Officer,you have to listen to me!

131
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:44,076
在這裡我只聽女人命令
{\fs12}I only listen to women here.

132
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:45,269
不會聽男人的
{\fs12}Not man.

133
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:47,511
再說…
{\fs12}And...

134
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:51,196
你也不算是一個真正的男人
{\fs12}You are not a real man.

135
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:07,031
走開
{\fs12}Get out of here.

136
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:08,833
大祭師，你放過她吧
{\fs12}Please,let her go.

137
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:16,393
從現在開始，你已經不是玄機使
{\fs12}From now on,you are not XuanJi Officer anymore.

138
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:33,715
女皇陛下
{\fs12}Your majesty.

139
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:37,350
你身為皇宮禁軍統領
{\fs12}As the person who is in charge of security team.

140
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:39,712
皇宮密室有人偷東西
{\fs12}Someone stole something from the 
Secret room in our Palace.

141
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:43,157
當時，你為什麼不在現場指揮抓賊？
{\fs12}At that time,why didni't you do anything?

142
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:44,916
女皇陛下
{\fs12}Your majesty!

143
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:48,273
當時我在城門外監督修建城牆
{\fs12}I am watch those who are fixing the wall at that time.

144
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:50,911
而且，女皇曾經下令
{\fs12}And,You ever said:

145
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:52,559
皇宮密室是禁地
{\fs12}The secret room is forbidden.

146
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:56,749
更何況，現在只不過是
不見了一塊石頭嘛
{\fs12}And,we only lose a flagstone.

147
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,155
閉嘴！
{\fs12}Shut up!

148
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:08,835
我知道你當時去妓院嫖男人了
{\fs12}I know you are fucking with someone at that time.

149
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:10,639
賜你死刑！
{\fs12}And you will get a death penalty!

150
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:11,636
女皇陛下…
{\fs12}Your Majesty...

151
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:14,352
拉出去，殺！
{\fs12}Get him out,kill him!

152
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:16,114
是！
{\fs12}Yes!

153
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:22,150
最討厭看到雙雙對對的
{\fs12}I hate those matched couple.

154
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:38,229
女皇真的是越來越變態
{\fs12}The Queen is getting crazy.

155
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:56,393
兩生花開，帝皇星現
{\fs12}The star of King appear,

156
00:16:57,400 --> 00:17:01,871
乾坤倒轉，天下大亂
{\fs12}The world is messing around.

157
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:34,240
怎麼樣，他們誰是帝皇星？
{\fs12}How is it?Who is the Star of King.

158
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,553
兩個都不是
{\fs12}Both of them are not.

159
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:39,955
殺！
{\fs12}Kill him!

160
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:53,473
前皇族的族譜上，只剩下這一個了
{\fs12}There is only one left on the family tree.

161
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,468
那麼他一定就是我們要找的帝皇星
{\fs12}So,he must be the Star of King.

162
00:17:57,320 --> 00:18:00,312
我現在最擔心是那塊石板
會落入帝皇星的手上
{\fs12}I worried about that flagstone.
I don't want him to have it.

163
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:04,437
然後被他破解了石板之迷
找到那把神劍
{\fs12}If he decode the flagstone,and find the sword.

164
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,070
那就麻煩了
{\fs12}That will be a huge trouble.

165
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:09,630
雖然那塊石板
被臥虎藏龍的叛黨偷走了
{\fs12}Even the flagstone is stolen by 
Croching tiger,hidden dragon group.

166
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:13,831
可是他們未必知道帝皇星在哪裡
{\fs12}However,they might know where is
The star of King.

167
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:18,189
臥虎藏龍不知道，可是那石板知道
{\fs12}They don't know,the flagstone knows.

168
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:23,398
它是有靈性的
它自己會找到真正的帝皇星
{\fs12}It has spiritualism
It could find the star by itself.

169
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:28,192
跟蹤那塊石板下落
就一定會找到帝皇星
{\fs12}Follow wherever the flagstone is.
You find the star.

170
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:29,589
找到又怎麼樣？
{\fs12}Even we find the star,so what?

171
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:33,515
他注定要坐你的位子
{\fs12}He is doomed to take your place.

172
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,478
你找死？
{\fs12}What,you wanna die?

173
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:45,793
你把我殺了吧！
{\fs12}Kill me place!

174
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:49,835
我怎麼捨得殺你呢？我還沒恨夠
{\fs12}How could I kill you?I am not that bad.

175
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:55,793
女皇，她是你妹妹啊
{\fs12}Your majesty,she is your sister!!

176
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:58,635
你心痛啊？
{\fs12}You are feeling the pain?

177
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:00,355
我…
{\fs12}I...

178
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,196
不好
{\fs12}Oh

179
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,158
你的傷口…         不許碰我！
{\fs12}-Your wound...
-Don't touch me!
 
180
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:09,591
永遠都不許碰我
{\fs12}Never,ever touch me!!!

181
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,674
你碰過的東西…
{\fs12}Whatever you have touched...

182
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:15,233
我都不要
{\fs12}I don't want tham.

183
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:22,635
姐姐，預言說
{\fs12}Sister,the predict said that

184
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:25,798
我們嫁給皇帝，就可以得到天下
{\fs12}If we are married with the King,We will get the world

185
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:29,238
你不可能為了愛情放棄這個世界
{\fs12}You cannot lose the world,only for the love.

186
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:31,314
我可以
{\fs12}But I can.

187
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,639
我有尉繚就夠了
{\fs12}I have Nei Liao

188
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:48,196
尉繚！
{\fs12}Nei Liao!

189
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:52,231
雅歌？
{\fs12}Ya Ge?

190
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:55,475
那麼她是…
{\fs12}So,she is...

191
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:57,475
你是雅婷？
{\fs12}You are Ya Ting?

192
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:02,508
雅婷，我永遠不會原諒你！
{\fs12}Ya Ting,I will never forgive you!

193
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:06,590
有人行刺皇上！
{\fs12}Someone try to assassinate the King!

194
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:23,429
從此以後
{\fs12}From now on.

195
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:25,678
我要全天下的男人…
{\fs12}I will make all men in the world...

196
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:27,189
忍辱偷生
{\fs12}Suffer and Torture

197
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:29,955
全都受我控制
{\fs12}All of them will be under my control.

198
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:42,319
立刻追查石板下落
{\fs12}Go to get any information about the flagstone,Now

199
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:46,190
飛鷹會帶你去找偷石板那個人
{\fs12}The Eagly will bring you to find the one
Who stole the flagstone.

200
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:49,433
還有，他被女兵們圍捕的時候
{\fs12}And,when he was besiedge by our soldier.

201
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:51,472
左手手臂受了刀傷
{\fs12}He has the cut would on his left arm.

202
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:53,674
找到馬上通知我
{\fs12}Tell me whenever you find him.

203
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:55,349
瞭解
{\fs12}Got it.

204
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,195
預備…
{\fs12}Prepare...

205
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:47,192
一、二、三，上！
{\fs12}1,2,3,Go!

206
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,551
不好意思，再來一次
{\fs12}Sorry,again.

207
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:57,992
你搞什麼嘛？
{\fs12}What are you doing?

208
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:59,309
不好意思，計算錯誤
{\fs12}Sorry,a mistake.

209
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:00,797
你沒事吧？
{\fs12}Are you ok?

210
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:01,557
臭小子！
{\fs12}You idiot!

211
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:05,789
你們今晚休想有飯吃！
{\fs12}Don't even think about the dinner tonight!

212
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,319
桃桃呢？    不知道
{\fs12}-Where is Peachy?
-I don't know.

213
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,479
都開場了，沒有女主角怎麼行？
{\fs12}We cannot start it without leading role!!

214
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:15,115
瓜子，去穿桃桃的衣服
{\fs12}Melon Seed.Go get the cloth of Peachy,and try it on.

215
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:16,713
黑木爺，這次一定沒問題
{\fs12}Master Blackwood.We would have no problem this time.

216
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:19,556
再來一次
{\fs12}Again

217
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:39,273
在很久很久以前，有一對雙胞胎仙女
{\fs12}Once Upon a time.There are a fairy twins

218
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:42,876
天神很希望把她們一起娶了做老婆
{\fs12}The god want to marry them all.

219
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:47,149
可是，妹妹卻好像有點煩惱…
{\fs12}However.the younger sister seems to have a trouble...

220
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,710
剛好來得及！    你跑哪去了？
{\fs12}-Just on time!
-Where are you?

221
00:22:58,960 --> 00:22:59,790
黑木爺到處找你
{\fs12}Master Blackwood is looking for you everywhere.

222
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:02,117
你的手…
{\fs12}Your hand...

223
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:03,629
沒什麼，小意思
{\fs12}Don't worry.not a big deal.

224
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,309
我跟臥虎藏龍做大事，賺大錢
{\fs12}I have a business with Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon.
I will make big money.

225
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:07,237
臥虎藏龍？
{\fs12}Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon?

226
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:08,998
就是被人通緝的臥虎藏龍？
{\fs12}The one who is the most wanted now?

227
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:10,389
他很了不起啊！
{\fs12}He is super!

228
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:13,433
三天之後，我去跳虎崖
把這塊東西交給他
{\fs12}I wil give this to him at Tiger Jump Cliff
in 3 days.

229
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:15,719
然後我就不會再回來了
{\fs12}After the,I would never return.

230
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:18,158
這是…不要碰它！很值錢…
{\fs12}This is...Don't touch it!!It worth a lot of money.

231
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:20,949
臭小子！你跑哪去，這麼晚才回來？
{\fs12}You stupid!Where are you,you are late.

232
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:23,039
什麼東西值錢？    出場了…
{\fs12}-What are you guys talking about?
-Get on the stage.

233
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:24,958
出場了… 快換衣服！
{\fs12}Go,go to change your cloth!

234
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:31,395
預備… 一、二、三…
{\fs12}Prepare!1,2,3!

235
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:42,388
他一看到美女，他的耳朵…
{\fs12}Whenever he see a pretty women,His Ear...

236
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,915
就砰一下，紅卜卜的
{\fs12}His ear will get red all of a sudden.

237
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:46,350
我漂不漂亮？
{\fs12}Am I Pretty?

238
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:48,194
漂亮
{\fs12}Yes,you are.

239
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:57,437
幹什麼？
{\fs12}What?

240
00:23:57,800 --> 00:24:00,109
黑木爺，你幫我卜一課吧
{\fs12}Master Blackwood.Give me a augury.

241
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,433
你都快要出場了，還占卜？
{\fs12}You are ready for the play.An Augury!?

242
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:04,711
拜託，很重要
{\fs12}Please,it is very important.

243
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:05,870
什麼事那麼重要？
{\fs12}What is so important?

244
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:07,197
姻緣
{\fs12}Marriage.

245
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:16,433
拿去自己看
{\fs12}Ok,here,take it and have a look.

246
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:21,909
白馬
{\fs12}White Horse.

247
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:25,189
人獸不能配，這邊！
{\fs12}Human and beast don't match each other.This side!

248
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:33,239
黑木爺，好靈啊！
{\fs12}Master Blackwood,you are good!

249
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:35,159
靈了是嗎？    靈！

{\fs12}-Are you happy now? 
-Happy!

251
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:38,113
開心就好好做事，走    好
{\fs12}-You could work well if you are happy.
-Good luck.

252
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:57,437
我漂不漂亮？
{\fs12}Am I pretty?

253
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:58,192
漂亮
{\fs12}Pretty.

254
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:00,229
認真一點

266
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:36,158
不聽，不聽…

讓我留在你身邊吧
{\fs12}Let me stay with you.

273
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:11,520
所有男人都不可以接近我
{\fs12}No man could get close to me.

274
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:14,717
既然你這麼恨男人…
{\fs12}Since you hate man so much.

275
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:19,315
好！我就切！

278
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:34,915

{\fs12}I thought you found the flagstone already.

288
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:37,076
吃餅吧
{\fs12}Have a cake.

289
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:50,275
把石板交出來
{\fs12}Turn in the flatstone.

290
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:54,948
我看你是個人材
{\fs12}I consider you as a talented man.

291
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:59,077
當我拿到了神劍之後
我可以封你做大祭司
{\fs12}I want you to be "JISI" after I got the Sword.

292
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:01,754
到時候，我們可以一起去打江山
{\fs12}After than,let's build our kindom together.

293
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:03,838
我們根本就不同路
{\fs12}We are not on the same boat.

294
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:07,198
好吧，那你就當你的忠心僕人吧
{\fs12}Well,just keep being a royal slave.

295
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:12,709
這是什麼？
{\fs12}What is this?

296
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:14,798
是昨天桃桃偷偷交給我的
{\fs12}Peach gave it to me yesterday secretly.

297
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:17,156
他叫我明天一起交還給那個…
{\fs12}He ask me to give this to that...

298
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:18,834
臥虎藏龍
{\fs12}Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon.

299
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:21,670
然後跟著他一起賺大錢
{\fs12}I will make some money with him after then.

300
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:24,677
寶石啊！
{\fs12}What a diamond!

301
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:31,871
發財了
{\fs12}We will get rich.

302
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:33,789
這是地圖
{\fs12}This is the map.

303
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,319
這不是多依河嗎？
{\fs12}Is this River Duo yi?

304
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:39,475
我知道了，這是藏寶地圖
{\fs12}I see,this is the mapy for treasure.

305
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:41,917
寶石的位置就是寶藏
{\fs12}The position of the dimond is where the treasure is at.

306
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:45,638
我知道…那座…
{\fs12}Oh,I know...

307
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:51,678
柴頭還沒回來？多烤條魚給他吃
{\fs12}Block head is not back yet,grill some fish for him.

308
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:54,272
炭頭呢？
{\fs12}Where is charcoal head?

309
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:56,716
炭頭東西呢？
{\fs12}Where is his stuff?

310
00:31:58,920 --> 00:31:59,955
咕咕，你說
{\fs12}Googoo,tell me.

311
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:03,798
他們拿著石板，去找臥虎藏龍
{\fs12}They have the flagstone,and went to look for 
Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon.

312
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:05,314
說去尋寶
{\fs12}They said they are looking for some treasure

313
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:08,433
尋寶？尋什麼寶？
{\fs12}Treasure?What treasure?

314
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:12,675
聽說臥虎藏龍是一個很威武的人
{\fs12}I heard about Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon 
is a strong,handsome man.

315
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:16,199
貼好了，小意思嘛
{\fs12}Ok,done.piece of cake.

316
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:18,711
不對吧
{\fs12}No,it's not right.

317
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:21,996
再試試
{\fs12}Try again.

318
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:28,437
炭頭
{\fs12}Charcoal head.

319
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:29,470
天氣不錯
{\fs12}What a nice day

320
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:31,598
我就是臥虎藏龍
{\fs12}I am Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon.

321
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:33,390
女人？
{\fs12}Women?

322
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:34,991
白馬？
{\fs12}White Horse?

323
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:38,238
我英俊瀟灑
騎匹白馬有什麼大驚小怪？
{\fs12}I am handsome,and ride on a white horse.
You don't have to fuss.

324
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:41,434
你去看我們演過戲
{\fs12}Have you ever watch our play?

325
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:44,548
我們出來混的
當然什麼事都要小心點
{\fs12}I have to be careful of anything
since I make a living everywhere.

326
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:46,318
這種小功夫怎麼少得了
{\fs12}You have to have this kinda skill.

327
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:48,110
是呀…
{\fs12}Yes,you are right.

328
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:50,038
把藏寶圖給我
{\fs12}Show me the map.

329
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:58,790
桃桃呢？怎麼沒看見他？
{\fs12}Where is Peachy,I did see her.

330
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,470
我剛剛叫他找第二個寶藏
他現在發達了
{\fs12}I just asked him to go for the 2nd treasure.
He will get rich this time.

331
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:05,316
他發達啦
{\fs12}Yes he will.

332
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:07,957
大哥，我好想跟著你
{\fs12}Master,I want to work with you and follow you.

333
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:10,108
我一向獨來獨往
{\fs12}I usually come and go alone.

334
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:13,555
大哥，你拼不出來的
{\fs12}It's too hard for you.

335
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:14,590
我是做大事的人
{\fs12}I am someone who would do something big.

336
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:17,315
這種雞毛蒜皮的事
當然讓手下去做
{\fs12}So,you should let us do such piece of cake.

337
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:18,959
我們就是你手下啦
{\fs12}We are your understrapper.

338
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:28,677
這種粗重的事讓我們來做
{\fs12}Let us do these kinda stuff.

339
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:29,750
你帶我們一起去
{\fs12}Bring us with you.

340
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:34,070
你們倆個要脅我是不是？
{\fs12}Are you forcing me?

341
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:37,440
我收你們做手下，你們負責帶路
{\fs12}Ok,I will accept you guys.You need to lead me the way.

342
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:41,351
你又是誰？
{\fs12}Who are you?

343
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:43,272
臥虎藏龍
{\fs12}Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon.

344
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:45,438
你是臥虎藏龍，那他又是誰？
{\fs12}You are Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon
And,who is him?

345
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:48,394
臥虎藏龍那麼能打
{\fs12}He is a good fighter.

346
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,752
誰打贏了不就是誰
{\fs12}Who win,who would be the real one.

347
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:53,075
你來得剛好
{\fs12}Well,you just come on the right time.

348
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:56,713
其實我們倆個都是臥虎藏龍
{\fs12}Actually,both of us are Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon

349
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:00,435
我臥虎，她藏龍
{\fs12}I am Crouching Tiger.She is Hidden Dragon

350
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:03,351
我們是兩姐妹
{\fs12}We are sisters.

351
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:14,434
你不也是為了寶藏嗎？不如我們合作
{\fs12}You are looking for the treasure,too,aren't you?
How about,working together.

352
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:16,636
免得一拍兩瞪眼
{\fs12}This could avoid any conflict.

353
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:19,319
我們是好姐妹！
{\fs12}We are good sisters!

354
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:23,036
好好的幹嘛粘著鬍子？
{\fs12}Why do you have that mustache on?

355
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:24,912
是這樣子，現在流行
{\fs12}Well,it is popular to have a mustache now.

356
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:27,236
你要不要？撕一半給你怎樣？
{\fs12}You like it,I can give you half piece of my mustache?

357
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:30,078
我們走
{\fs12}Let's go.

358
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:34,349
找到寶藏後，我們也有份嗎？
{\fs12}Are we going to get some of the treasure
after we find them?

359
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:35,710
分你們一成
{\fs12}10%

360
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:38,196
有沒有搞錯啊？這麼大方
{\fs12}What?That is good.

361
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:40,990
戴起來！
{\fs12}Get this on!

362
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:47,030
我們說做你的手下
{\fs12}I said I will work for you.

363
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:48,713
沒說要做你的鈴鐺
{\fs12}But I have see I will sell the bells for you,too.

364
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:51,390
對，我們不做鈴鐺那玩意
{\fs12}Yes,we don't do nothing about bells.

365
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:53,354
所以說你們沒學問
{\fs12}So,you are stupid.

366
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:55,717
男人走在街上是犯法的
{\fs12}Man walking in the street is illlegal

367
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,513
這叫障眼法
{\fs12}This is called camouflage

368
00:34:58,800 --> 00:34:59,835
走
{\fs12}Let's go.

369
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:14,158
先說好，這件事是我先發現
{\fs12}I have to make it clear.
I am the first one to discover this.

370
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:17,952
假如找到寶藏以後，我要分大的
{\fs12}I need something more than 10% after we find them.

371
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:19,076
好
{\fs12}No proglem.

372
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:21,156
我七你三
{\fs12}70% for me,30% for you.

373
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:22,277
好
{\fs12}Deal!

374
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:25,559
我八你二才對
{\fs12}You know what,it should be 80-20

375
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:27,157
好
{\fs12}Well,ok.

376
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:28,270
這麼大方？
{\fs12}Like that?

377
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:30,995
你別坑我，我很聰明的
{\fs12}Don't play with me.I am not stupid.

378
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:33,592
我好想把他們賣掉做鈴鐺
{\fs12}I really want to sell them to make the bells.

379
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:36,993
對對對…我忘記大家都是同行
{\fs12}Right,right,we are doing the same business.

380
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:41,513
可是酷點那個…我已經有客人訂了
{\fs12}But,that cool one...My client have reserved.

381
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:43,149
沒問題…
{\fs12}No problem.

382
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:50,873
你肚子餓不餓？
{\fs12}Are you hungry?

383
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:54,319
你們兩個    是
{\fs12}-Hey,you two.
-Yes,Sir.

384
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:55,714
抓隻兔子給我做晚餐
{\fs12}Go get a rabbit for our dinner.

385
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:56,836
好！
{\fs12}Yes,Sir!

386
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:02,914
這邊
{\fs12}There.

387
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:11,959
那邊
{\fs12}That side.

388
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:13,599
我說在那邊嘛    那裡也有！
{\fs12}-I said this side.
-There is one there,too!

389
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:15,035
那邊
{\fs12}That side.

390
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:35,995
你沒事吧？
{\fs12}Are you ok?

391
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,069
痛不痛？
{\fs12}How is it?

392
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:50,910
兩位大爺，可不可以不吃它？
{\fs12}My master,Do we have to eat it?

393
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:54,715
它受了傷，而且樣子可愛
{\fs12}It is wounded,and it is so cute.

394
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:59,715
既然它那麼可憐
那我們就不吃它了
{\fs12}Ok,we won't eat it since it is cute.

395
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:01,389
那吃你好了！
{\fs12}So,you will be our dinner!

396
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:04,672
一點用都沒有
放了它我們晚上吃什麼？
{\fs12}Idiot,what do we have if you let it go?

397
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:07,792
說打呢，你還有一套
{\fs12}Talking about fighting,you are good.

398
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:11,476
至於男人，你哪裡有我經驗豐富
{\fs12}Talking about being a man,I am a Pro.

399
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:13,839
我還以為你很專業呢
{\fs12}I thought you are so professional

400
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:17,108
我們賣鈴鐺的
怎麼可以付出真感情？
{\fs12}We could not bring out our real heart since 
we sells bells.

401
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:18,835
你能這麼說就對了
{\fs12}Yeah,you are right.

402
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:22,039
不就是男人嘛，說說話沒有關係
{\fs12}Come on,it doesn't matter.

403
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:24,710
可是，我看你對那塊木炭…
{\fs12}But,I think you have a crush on that Charcoal Head.

404
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:26,075
好像不大對勁…
{\fs12}It is not normal.

405
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:28,351
你是不是對他動了真情？
{\fs12}Are you falling in love?

406
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:29,556
神經病
{\fs12}Stupid.

407
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:33,349
這有什麼好害羞的？
我們都是女人嘛，喜歡就說
{\fs12}Don't be shy?
We are women,we could talk about this kinda stuff.

408
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:37,079
我對那木炭…一點興趣都沒有
{\fs12}I am interested in Charoal head at all.

409
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:40,472
好，你不要，我要了
{\fs12}Ok,if you don't want him.I will take him.

410
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:41,836
隨便
{\fs12}Whatever.

411
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:43,678
那我就不客氣了
{\fs12}Ok,I will do it.

412
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:08,111
你興奮一點，大聲一點
{\fs12}You  better shout,and let everyone know.

413
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:50,073
其實…臥虎他…
{\fs12}Actually,Crouching Tiger...He,uh...

414
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:01,072
臥虎大爺，床我已經鋪好了
{\fs12}Mr.Crouching Tiger,I have made the bed for you.

415
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:03,510
還有什麼吩咐？我什麼都行的
{\fs12}Anything else I can do?

416
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:07,399
那你最拿手的是什麼？
{\fs12}What are you good at?

417
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,355
鴛鴦嬉水
{\fs12}We could shower together.

418
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:20,636
還有呢？
{\fs12}Whatelse?

419
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:24,470
我這兩片烈火紅唇
{\fs12}I have two sexy lips.

420
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:32,430
還有…
{\fs12}And...

421
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:33,789
夠了…
{\fs12}Enough.

422
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:35,673
還好今天吃得不多
{\fs12}God,I am lucky that I didn't eat so much today.

423
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:38,834
不用了，你走吧
{\fs12}Ok,you could go now.

424
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:41,469
既然來了，你就讓我幫你擦個背吧
{\fs12}Come one,let me wash your back for you.

425
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:42,755
不用了啦
{\fs12}No.

426
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:44,948
我擦背超棒的
{\fs12}I could make you fell very comforble.

427
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:46,395
來嘛，試試看
{\fs12}Come one,just try.

428
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:48,238
我說不用了！
{\fs12}I said no!

429
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:52,193
最討厭人家自己送上門的
{\fs12}I hate when girl does this.

430
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:02,394
龍弟，你還生我氣？
{\fs12}Are you mad at me?

431
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:03,589
別那麼小器嘛
{\fs12}Come on.

432
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:06,548
臥虎哥，男人會讓我生氣？
{\fs12}Tiger,man could make me angry

433
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:10,470
你知不知道我在想什麼？
我在想寶藏
{\fs12}You know what I am thinking aobut now?
I am thinking about the Treasure.

434
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:11,875
錢呢！
{\fs12}How about money!

435
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:13,075
我們準備好了
{\fs12}Money is enough.

436
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:16,191
過來
{\fs12}Come over here.

437
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:20,189
你幹什麼？你以為自己是什麼？
{\fs12}What are you doing?Who do you think you are?

438
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:23,233
戴起來！木頭一樣
{\fs12}Wear it!You are like a woodhead.

439
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:30,952
年輕人，不要難過
{\fs12}Young guy,take it easy.

440
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:33,550
女人就是這樣，口是心非
{\fs12}Woman is always janus-faced.

441
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:14,599
餅來了，趁熱吃
{\fs12}Cake is coming,have some.

442
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:15,752
謝謝

{\fs12}Thank you.

444
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:31,310
吃餅吧
{\fs12}Have some cake.

445
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:33,669
我最討厭吃餅
{\fs12}I hate eating this.

446
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:35,989
這又何必呢？
{\fs12}Why?

447
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:38,789
不就是吃的嘛，又沒有得罪你
{\fs12}Just a cake.

448
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:40,070
對不對？
{\fs12}Right?

449
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:43,829
兩位美女
{\fs12}Two pretty girls.

450
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:48,479
我叫「傾國傾城」
不介意我坐下吧？
{\fs12}I am Miss Pretty.
Do you mind if sit here?

451
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:50,230
介意啊
{\fs12}Yes I mind.

452
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:52,273
介意我也得坐下
{\fs12}I will sit here anyway.

453
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:54,911
這位大娘，你蠻時髦的
{\fs12}Hey,you are pretty fashionable.

454
00:41:55,720 --> 00:41:57,950
你那兩撇鬍子真是超性感
{\fs12}Especially your two piece of mustache.

455
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:01,790
這位美女真識貨，我老實告訴你吧
{\fs12}En,you got good taste.Let me tell you.

456
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:04,554
我剛剛在隔壁那家店做的
{\fs12}I make this from the shop over there.

457
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:07,792
絕對是真發，不是「行貨」
{\fs12}It's a actual hair.It's not fake.

458
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:12,357
這兩個當當看起來很嬌媚呀
{\fs12}It looks sexy.

459
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:14,712
對了，你們出不出讓？
{\fs12}You wanna sell it?

460
00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:16,798
不如賣給我呀
{\fs12}Sell it to me.

461
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:19,512
我們不…    誰叫你說話？
{\fs12}No,who let you speak?

462
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:20,630
我們不賣
{\fs12}No.we don't sell

463
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:24,556
大娘，你年紀都這麼大了
{\fs12}How old are you.

464
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:26,956
這兩個當當你玩不動的
{\fs12}You cannot have these.

465
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:29,555
我告訴你們兩個
{\fs12}Let me tell you.

466
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:32,595
我是女皇的密使，帶著女皇的密令
{\fs12}I am The Queen's emissary.

467
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:35,032
專誠帶他們倆個回皇宮的
{\fs12}I need to bring them back to the palace.

468
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:37,635
女皇密使？證明呢？
{\fs12}Emissary?Prove it?

469
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:39,518
看仔細了，別貶眼睛
{\fs12}Look.

470
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:51,108
拿塊餅出來就說是女皇密使是吧？
{\fs12}The cake is the proof?

471
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:53,920
你有是吧？我還有呢
{\fs12}I have one,too.

472
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:57,989
你是誰？
{\fs12}Who are you?

473
00:42:58,360 --> 00:42:59,236
臥虎藏龍！
{\fs12}Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon!

474
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:00,988
又是臥虎藏龍？
{\fs12}Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon again?

475
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:03,192
假的！
{\fs12}Fake one!

476
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:26,875
不好意思，多有冒犯
{\fs12}Sorry about this.

477
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:28,832
這杯酒，算我向你陪罪
{\fs12}This is for the apology.

478
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:29,916
算啦…
{\fs12}That's ok.

479
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:35,036
你剛才說那兩個混小子
其中一個是帝皇星？
{\fs12}You said one of those young guys is the Star of King?

480
00:43:35,560 --> 00:43:36,754
那豈不是將來的皇帝？
{\fs12}That mean,he would be the next King?

481
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:39,197
不錯，根據預言…
{\fs12}Yes,according to the Predict...

482
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:43,358
這塊石板就可以引帝皇星出現
{\fs12}This flagstone will bring out the Star of the King.

483
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:46,632
找到鬼城，拿回神劍，推翻女魔王
{\fs12}Find the Ghost City,get the sword,and kill the Monster.

484
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:49,872
我們男人就不再受女魔王的壓迫
{\fs12}So,we don't have to suffer anymore.

485
00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:53,910
我的責任就是要保護帝皇星
拿回神劍
{\fs12}Our responsibility is to protect our King
And,get the sword back.

486
00:43:56,080 --> 00:43:56,796
你好偉大！
{\fs12}You are so great!

487
00:44:01,720 --> 00:44:03,392
這皇帝你做定了，不用擔心
{\fs12}Don't worry,you will be the King for sure.

488
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:05,159
不一定呀
{\fs12}Not really.

489
00:44:07,080 --> 00:44:08,593
你們兩個幹嘛討論得那麼興奮？
{\fs12}Then,why you guys are so excited?

490
00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:10,991
說來說去，也不知真的假的
{\fs12}It's not even true.

491
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,753
而且要推翻女魔王
你們兩個能打嗎？
{\fs12}Are you two strong enough to kill the Queen?

492
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:15,838
算了
{\fs12}Forget about it.

493
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:18,157
趕快收拾東西，跟我回劇團
{\fs12}Wrap it up,and leave.

494
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:20,312
起碼下半輩子安安穩穩
{\fs12}I want it to be nice in the rest of our lives.

495
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:21,949
來…收拾東西
{\fs12}Come one,wrap it up.

496
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:23,316
黑木爺
{\fs12}Master Blackwood.

497
00:44:24,600 --> 00:44:28,639
黑木爺，黑木爺…
{\fs12}Master Blackwood,Master Blackwood...

498
00:44:28,840 --> 00:44:29,795
少廢話！我不跟你說了
{\fs12}Shut up.I have nothing to say to you.

499
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:31,071
黑木爺…
{\fs12}Master Blackwood.

500
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:34,758
你冷靜一點
心平氣和聽我說好不好？
{\fs12}Come down and listen to me,ok?

501
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:37,076
兩位，可不可以借個火？
{\fs12}Hey,can I borrow the lighter?

502
00:44:37,320 --> 00:44:37,957
我不抽煙
{\fs12}I don't smoke.

503
00:44:53,320 --> 00:44:54,469
我漂不漂亮？
{\fs12}Am I pretty?

504
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:06,673
你們兩個還不趕快收拾東西？
{\fs12}Hurry up and let's go home?

505
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:09,150
差點被那兩個傢伙攪和了
{\fs12}They almost ruin everything.

506
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:11,432
你們又不是臥虎藏龍
{\fs12}You are not Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon.

507
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:14,748
你不是要寶藏嗎？
跟誰有什麼關係？
{\fs12}Are you looking for the treasure?
Anything to do with someone?

508
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:17,960
就是嘛，你跟他們又凶又笨
{\fs12}See,they are bad and stupid.

509
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:19,633
誰好誰壞都不知道
{\fs12}They cannot even recognize who is bad or nice.

510
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:22,556
走了…
{\fs12}Let's go.

511
00:45:22,840 --> 00:45:25,434
這樣子丟下黑木爺，不太好吧？
{\fs12}We cannot just leave Master Blackwood there alone.

512
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:28,317
你看他們現在多好
{\fs12}They are doing good there.

513
00:45:29,240 --> 00:45:31,435
等我做了皇帝，黑木爺就不用愁了
{\fs12}Master Blackwood would be happy after I become the King.

514
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:34,157
你又可以跟夢中情人在一起了
{\fs12}And you could stay with your dream man.

515
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:36,429
你這東西真有用
{\fs12}This is good.

516
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:39,668
銷魂香嘛
所有賣鈴鐺的都會有這東西
{\fs12}Everyone who sell bells,has it.

517
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:40,630
你沒有嗎？
{\fs12}You don't have it?

518
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:42,397
給你
{\fs12}Here you go.

519
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:43,871
可以走了
{\fs12}Ready to go.

520
00:45:44,120 --> 00:45:44,870
那快點
{\fs12}Hurry up.

521
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:47,871
快點啊
{\fs12}Come on,hurry up.

522
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:15,917
炭頭，如果我做了皇帝…
{\fs12}Charcoal,if I am the King.

523
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:17,798
我們男人就不用再做奴隸了
{\fs12}We will not be the slaves anymore.

524
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:20,995
不過，說不定你才是皇帝呢
{\fs12}Maybe,you will be the King.

525
00:46:21,560 --> 00:46:22,788
我有信心一定是你
{\fs12}I am confident that you will be the one.

526
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:33,869
我幫你吧
{\fs12}I will help you.

527
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:43,759
皇室寶藏…應該有很多錢
{\fs12}There should be a lot of money there.

528
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:47,118
靠那麼近幹嘛，我跟你很熟？
{\fs12}Don't get close to me,Do I know you?

529
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:50,319
你不要誤會我，我不是來巴結你的
{\fs12}Don't misunderstand.

530
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:52,278
你以為我很想做皇后？
{\fs12}You think I want to be the Queen?

531
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:54,790
我才不稀罕，那麼累
{\fs12}I don't like it.

532
00:46:55,320 --> 00:46:56,070
好肉麻
{\fs12}So sick.

533
00:46:56,440 --> 00:46:59,238
明明是想做想得想死了，還不承認
{\fs12}You don't say it,but I know you want it so much.

534
00:47:00,080 --> 00:47:02,196
我是一個很有上進心的人
{\fs12}I am working hard.

535
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:05,639
柴頭最瞭解我了
{\fs12}Charcoal knows me.

536
00:47:06,840 --> 00:47:08,558
最恨人家那麼主動
{\fs12}I hate this.

537
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:21,758
你不知道摸女人是犯法的嗎？
{\fs12}Don't you touching women is illegal?

538
00:47:23,480 --> 00:47:24,674
砍掉你的手！
{\fs12}Chop your hand!

539
00:47:56,760 --> 00:47:57,590
快要到鬼城了
{\fs12}We are getting close to Ghost City.

540
00:48:08,440 --> 00:48:11,591
還說是鬼城，都沒有鬼
{\fs12}There is no ghost here.

541
00:48:12,280 --> 00:48:13,235
你不就是鬼嗎？
{\fs12}You are one?

542
00:48:16,120 --> 00:48:17,473
我是個艷鬼嘛
{\fs12}I am a sexy Ghost

543
00:48:50,520 --> 00:48:53,478
走啊，快走
{\fs12}Go,hurry up.

544
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,228
不要怕啊，我保護你
{\fs12}Don't be afraid.I will bless you.

545
00:49:39,120 --> 00:49:39,916
爬樹
{\fs12}Climb the trees.

546
00:50:04,680 --> 00:50:07,877
這是什麼鬼地方，怎麼這麼恐怖
{\fs12}What the hell is this,so scary.

547
00:50:08,320 --> 00:50:09,594
說了是鬼城嘛
{\fs12}It is Ghost City,I told you.

548
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:12,354
鬼？我最怕就是鬼了！
{\fs12}What,I am scared.

549
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:17,950
你小聲點
這麼大聲會把鬼引出來呀
{\fs12}Be Quiet.

550
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:20,071
那你抓緊我啊！
{\fs12}Hold me tight.

551
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:21,995
別那麼用力呀！
{\fs12}Too much.

552
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:34,029
把石板給我
{\fs12}Give me the flagstone.

553
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:54,074
紅鷲！
{\fs12}Red Vulture!

554
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:56,079
小心呀！
{\fs12}Watch out!

555
00:50:59,120 --> 00:50:59,916
你為什麼要救我？
{\fs12}Why did you save me?

556
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:01,071
雖然我們不同路
{\fs12}Even we are not on the same boat.

557
00:51:01,400 --> 00:51:03,994
我們還是從小一起長大的好姐妹
{\fs12}We are still good sisters.

558
00:51:04,600 --> 00:51:06,670
可是你根本不知道我心裡在想什麼
{\fs12}But,you don't even know what I am thinking.

559
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:10,877
我當然知道
做皇帝真的對你那麼重要嗎？
{\fs12}Of course I know.
Being a King is that important to you?

560
00:51:12,440 --> 00:51:13,429
今生今世
{\fs12}In my whole life.

561
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:15,269
做不成皇帝
{\fs12}If I cannot be the King.

562
00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:18,078
我死都不甘心
{\fs12}I will die sadly.

563
00:51:19,720 --> 00:51:21,676
抓緊，不要放手
{\fs12}Hold it tight.

564
00:51:22,560 --> 00:51:23,709
紅鷲！
{\fs12}Red Vulture!

565
00:51:34,120 --> 00:51:36,998
我不想這麼年輕就死
{\fs12}I cannot die young.

566
00:51:38,120 --> 00:51:40,588
放心吧，我們不會死的
{\fs12}Don't worry.We will not die.

567
00:51:43,080 --> 00:51:45,116
如果我死呢？
{\fs12}If I die?

568
00:51:45,800 --> 00:51:48,030
你記住一定要抓住我的手啊
{\fs12}Remember to hold my hand.

569
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:51,270
我怕一個人…
{\fs12}I am afraid of one man.

570
00:52:56,120 --> 00:52:57,030
原來你們是人？
{\fs12}You are humans?

571
00:52:57,360 --> 00:52:59,032
沒錯！我們就是…
{\fs12}Yes...

572
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:02,919
遁地人
{\fs12}The man of underground.

573
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:04,912
我是帕路帕
{\fs12}I am PaluPa

574
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:06,110
我是卡古卡
{\fs12}I am Kaguka

575
00:53:06,440 --> 00:53:07,793
你笑我笑
{\fs12}You smile.

576
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:11,430
你哭我哭
{\fs12}You cry.

577
00:53:12,280 --> 00:53:13,508
你凶我凶
{\fs12}You bad.

578
00:53:14,080 --> 00:53:15,069
你殺我殺
{\fs12}You kill

579
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:19,669
你們抱抱，我們抱抱
{\fs12}Hug me,haha.

580
00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:33,557
笑…
{\fs12}Laughing.

581
00:53:36,080 --> 00:53:37,672
我們要笑
{\fs12}I wanna laugh.

582
00:53:39,360 --> 00:53:41,191
笑啊…
{\fs12}Haha.

583
00:53:45,240 --> 00:53:46,150
你認真一點嘛
{\fs12}Be serious.

584
00:55:02,760 --> 00:55:03,795
你一點用都沒有！
{\fs12}You are useless!

585
00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:06,589
也不抓緊人家
{\fs12}You should hold me tight.

586
00:55:07,240 --> 00:55:07,831
是你呀
{\fs12}It's you.

587
00:55:08,040 --> 00:55:10,474
平時叫你多吃點東西嘛
也不聽人家話
{\fs12}I told you eat more,but you never listen to me.

588
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:12,316
討厭
{\fs12}Hate you.

589
00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:22,228
閉嘴！閉嘴！
{\fs12}Shut up.

590
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:43,756
耍我？
{\fs12}You are playing with me?

591
00:55:45,320 --> 00:55:46,116
跟我去找炭頭
{\fs12}Come one,let's go to look for Charcoal Head.

592
00:55:53,240 --> 00:55:57,199
我們遁地族的祖先
本來生活在北方的草原
{\fs12}We are teh ancience of Underground man.
We are originaly from Northern Grassland.

593
00:55:57,600 --> 00:55:59,989
在那裡我們生活得自由自在
{\fs12}We have a nice life there.

594
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:03,716
我們想笑就笑
{\fs12}We could laugh whenver we want.

595
00:56:05,320 --> 00:56:06,878
我們想哭就哭
{\fs12}Cry whenever we want.

596
00:56:08,120 --> 00:56:10,873
可是我們熱愛工作
我們白天拚命做
{\fs12}We love working,and we are hard working.

597
00:56:11,120 --> 00:56:13,031
晚上拚命玩
{\fs12}Have fun at night.

598
00:56:15,800 --> 00:56:17,950
可是那個女皇看不慣我們那麼開心
{\fs12}However,the Queen don't like these.

599
00:56:18,760 --> 00:56:20,193
她不准我們有愛情
{\fs12}We are not allowed to love.

600
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:24,629
所以，我們只好躲在這個山洞裡面
{\fs12}So,we have to hide in this cavity.

601
00:56:25,120 --> 00:56:26,633
繼續過我們的生活
{\fs12}To continue our life.

602
00:56:27,880 --> 00:56:30,599
可是你看看，躲呀躲的…
{\fs12}You could see,we are hiding everywhere.

603
00:56:31,880 --> 00:56:34,599
我們統統都變得神神鬼鬼
{\fs12}We became Ghosts.

604
00:56:34,800 --> 00:56:37,633
瘋瘋癲癲…還很怕見到陽光呢
{\fs12}Get crazy,and we cannot see the sunshine.

605
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:47,716
我們要報仇…
{\fs12}We want to revenge.

606
00:56:48,120 --> 00:56:51,271
帕路帕大哥，冷靜點！冷靜點！
{\fs12}PaluPa,calm down.

607
00:56:51,480 --> 00:56:56,952
報仇！報仇…
{\fs12}Revenge,revenge.

608
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:01,756
這些東西是不是你的？
{\fs12}Are those yours?

609
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:03,115
是，謝謝
{\fs12}Yes,thanks.

610
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:07,071
還有這個呢？
{\fs12}How about this?

611
00:57:08,520 --> 00:57:09,873
這是什麼？很好看
{\fs12}What is this?It looks good.

612
00:57:10,080 --> 00:57:11,195
不要碰！
{\fs12}Dont' touch it.

613
00:57:49,120 --> 00:57:52,112
炭頭
{\fs12}Charcoal.

614
00:57:53,160 --> 00:57:55,390
炭頭…
{\fs12}Charcoal...

615
00:57:55,880 --> 00:57:56,756
柴頭
{\fs12}Blockhead.

616
00:57:58,560 --> 00:58:00,835
這裡好大的霧啊，好恐怖啊
{\fs12}It's too foggy here.

617
00:58:01,120 --> 00:58:02,872
等霧散了我們再走吧
{\fs12}Let's go after the fog is gone.

618
00:58:04,920 --> 00:58:05,670
炭頭！
{\fs12}Charcoal.

619
00:58:09,560 --> 00:58:11,710
靠著石頭，好像安全一點
{\fs12}It is safe befhind the rock.

620
00:58:34,080 --> 00:58:36,674
柴頭…
{\fs12}Blockhead

621
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:37,835
是我們啊
{\fs12}It's us.

622
00:58:38,040 --> 00:58:38,756
是你們？
{\fs12}You?

623
00:58:40,040 --> 00:58:41,109
我還以為你被妖怪吃了
{\fs12}I thought you are gone.

624
00:58:41,800 --> 00:58:43,472
不是妖怪，是遁地族的人
{\fs12}They are not ghost but underground man.

625
00:58:43,720 --> 00:58:44,709
他們好好玩呀
{\fs12}The are so funny.

626
00:58:46,160 --> 00:58:47,878
你們幹嘛手牽手？
{\fs12}Why you are hand in hand?

627
00:58:48,520 --> 00:58:49,748
你們也抱得很緊呀
{\fs12}And hold each other this tight?

628
00:58:51,560 --> 00:58:52,276
我跟你很熟啊？
{\fs12}I know you well?

629
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:54,789
幹嘛？我現在讓你抱是便宜你了
{\fs12}What,you are taking advantage of me if you hug me.

630
00:58:56,120 --> 00:58:57,838
怎麼這裡霧這麼大
這裡是什麼地方？
{\fs12}What is this place,too foggy here.

631
00:59:01,520 --> 00:59:02,669
有道門    對呀
{\fs12}There is a door.

632
00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:07,235
應該是這裡了，千軍塚的入口
{\fs12}Here,the entrance.

633
00:59:07,800 --> 00:59:10,030
太好了…找到了！找到了！

634
00:59:13,160 --> 00:59:14,070
怎麼打開？
{\fs12}How to open it?

635
00:59:27,280 --> 00:59:27,871
是這裡了
{\fs12}Right here.

636
00:59:29,560 --> 00:59:30,549
要不要用塊石板？
{\fs12}Do we need that flagstone?

637
00:59:35,120 --> 00:59:36,269
這什麼鬼地方？
{\fs12}What is this damn place?

638
00:59:39,040 --> 00:59:39,950
不要管了，走吧
{\fs12}Forget about it,let's go.

639
00:59:44,560 --> 00:59:45,913
有好多武器啊
{\fs12}So many weapons here.

640
00:59:46,320 --> 00:59:47,878
金銀財寶呢？
{\fs12}Where is the treasure?

641
00:59:51,120 --> 00:59:52,439
不是說有把神劍嗎？
{\fs12}There should be a sword here?

642
00:59:53,080 --> 00:59:55,389
這麼多把，哪一把才是呀？
{\fs12}There are many of them,which one is the real one?

643
01:00:00,760 --> 01:00:02,512
剋星來了，快走啊！
{\fs12}He is coming,Let's go!

644
01:00:02,960 --> 01:00:04,188
快跑！快跑！
{\fs12}Hurry Up,run!

645
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:14,757
每次看到這個傢伙就倒霉
{\fs12}We have bad luch everytime when we see him.

646
01:00:20,120 --> 01:00:23,157
怎麼搞的？只有一池水四面牆…
{\fs12}What,only a pool,and walls.

647
01:00:24,680 --> 01:00:25,908
什麼都沒有
{\fs12}Nothing else.

648
01:01:57,880 --> 01:01:58,869
很好玩
{\fs12}Interesting.

649
01:01:59,080 --> 01:01:59,717
你們看
{\fs12}Look.

650
01:02:01,920 --> 01:02:02,636
是我！
{\fs12}That's me!

651
01:02:03,400 --> 01:02:04,958
怎麼會是我以前的事？
{\fs12}Why is was my past?

652
01:02:06,200 --> 01:02:07,269
耍騙術！
{\fs12}It's cheat!

653
01:02:09,800 --> 01:02:11,153
給錢啊！
{\fs12}Give me money

654
01:02:11,440 --> 01:02:12,714
你耍騙術！
{\fs12}You just cheat!

655
01:02:13,440 --> 01:02:14,589
自己人也騙？
{\fs12}Cheat your mates?

656
01:02:14,840 --> 01:02:16,114
什麼！什麼…
{\fs12}What!what...

657
01:02:16,360 --> 01:02:17,315
騙自己人？
{\fs12}Cheat mates?

658
01:02:18,040 --> 01:02:18,597
什麼？
{\fs12}What?

659
01:02:21,160 --> 01:02:21,956
有把劍
{\fs12}There is a sword.

660
01:02:24,200 --> 01:02:24,791
對！
{\fs12}Yes!

661
01:02:26,440 --> 01:02:27,998
真的有把劍啊！
{\fs12}There is a sword!

662
01:02:29,080 --> 01:02:30,957
那你就是皇帝，我就是皇后
{\fs12}Then you are the king,I'm the queen.

663
01:02:31,120 --> 01:02:32,109
我們就要發財了？
{\fs12}We'll be rich.

664
01:02:32,360 --> 01:02:33,270
做人謙虛點好
{\fs12}Be a nice man.

665
01:06:53,440 --> 01:06:55,158
看來你不像一個普通的戰士
{\fs12}You looks don't like a normal fighter.

666
01:06:55,480 --> 01:06:57,277
我是正陽族的臥虎藏龍
{\fs12}I'm Zheng Yang Tribe's warrior.

667
01:06:58,040 --> 01:07:01,032
在下是前朝的護國將軍，衛城
{\fs12}I'm the past dynasty's general.

668
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:18,232
押錯注了
{\fs12}Bet wrong

669
01:07:20,200 --> 01:07:21,599
我有說過自己是皇帝嗎？
{\fs12}Did I said I'm the king?

670
01:07:23,960 --> 01:07:26,554
是你說的，是你自己想當皇后
{\fs12}You said,you want to be the queen.

671
01:07:27,600 --> 01:07:30,558
幹嘛？做不成皇帝拿我出氣？
{\fs12}Vent your anger to me?

672
01:07:31,600 --> 01:07:33,238
還好沒把身體押下去
{\fs12}It's lucky I didn't bet my body

673
01:07:33,440 --> 01:07:34,759
不然我就虧大了！
{\fs12}then I lost so much!

674
01:07:34,960 --> 01:07:35,710
你再說一次
{\fs12}You say it again.

675
01:07:36,320 --> 01:07:37,389
再說一次就再說一次
{\fs12}I don't care.

676
01:07:37,680 --> 01:07:38,112
什麼？   柴頭，算了吧
{\fs12}What?Blockhead,forget about it.

677
01:07:39,440 --> 01:07:40,589
走開
{\fs12}Go away.

678
01:08:19,200 --> 01:08:21,873
你是碰巧的，你不會是帝皇星的
{\fs12}Just was lucky,you are not The Star of the King.

679
01:08:22,280 --> 01:08:23,633
快把劍丟掉啊
{\fs12}Drop the sword.

680
01:08:24,520 --> 01:08:25,999
我沒想過要拿這把劍
{\fs12}I never thought take this sword.

681
01:08:26,240 --> 01:08:28,151
柴頭，我真的不是故意的
{\fs12}Blockhead,that's not my purpose.

682
01:08:29,720 --> 01:08:30,789
快點放回去！
{\fs12}Put it back!

683
01:08:39,160 --> 01:08:39,637
藍翎
{\fs12}Blue.

684
01:08:41,080 --> 01:08:42,513
立刻追查石板下落
{\fs12}Find where is Armour right now.

685
01:08:43,480 --> 01:08:45,357
找到帝皇星就馬上通知我
{\fs12}Let me know if you find The Star of the King.

686
01:08:46,480 --> 01:08:47,230
瞭解
{\fs12}Roger.

687
01:08:47,960 --> 01:08:49,188
原來你是奸細
{\fs12}You are the spy.

688
01:08:52,480 --> 01:08:53,117
別讓她跑了！
{\fs12}Don't let her escape!

689
01:08:54,400 --> 01:08:55,116
你沒事吧？
{\fs12}Are you all right?

690
01:09:00,560 --> 01:09:03,518
為什麼…
{\fs12}Why...

691
01:09:04,640 --> 01:09:05,868
你快點放了炭頭！
{\fs12}Release Charcoal Head now!

692
01:09:06,280 --> 01:09:08,271
你為你的國家，我也為我的國家
{\fs12}You do for your country,and me for my country.

693
01:09:08,480 --> 01:09:09,833
你一直都是在欺騙我
{\fs12}You cheat me all the time.

694
01:09:11,200 --> 01:09:13,589
對不起…
{\fs12}I'm sorry...

695
01:09:13,800 --> 01:09:16,189
你要這把劍是嗎？我不要…
{\fs12}Did you want this sword?I don't want it...

696
01:09:16,560 --> 01:09:17,629
我給你！
{\fs12}I give it to you!

697
01:09:39,960 --> 01:09:42,428
帝皇星出現，花都有救了
{\fs12}The Star of the King appears,Huadu got chance.

698
01:09:43,400 --> 01:09:45,118
以後的事情就交給你了
{\fs12}Everything is yours now.

699
01:10:00,680 --> 01:10:02,318
痛死我了    炭頭！
{\fs12}Hurt.
-Charcoal Head!

700
01:10:03,920 --> 01:10:07,390
我不是故意的，我控制不了…
{\fs12}It's not my purpose,I can't control myself...

701
01:10:09,120 --> 01:10:10,269
你們走吧
{\fs12}You go first.

702
01:10:11,680 --> 01:10:13,238
走啊…
{\fs12}Go...

01:10:15,360 --> 01:10:16,793
走啊！
{\fs12}GO!

704
01:10:29,960 --> 01:10:32,110
我不要做皇帝！
{\fs12}I don't wanna be king!

705
01:10:39,120 --> 01:10:41,429
皇帝？胡弄人！
{\fs12}King?

706
01:10:44,200 --> 01:10:45,269
死要錢！
{\fs12}You only know money!

707
01:10:49,360 --> 01:10:50,839
妹妹剛剛跟我說
{\fs12}Sister just told me.

708
01:10:51,760 --> 01:10:54,911
真正的帝皇星已經得到了神劍
{\fs12}The Star of the King already got the Sword.

709

你放心，我已經有計劃
{\fs12}Take easy,I already have plan.

一定會抓到帝皇星和拿到那把神劍
{\fs12}We will get The Star of the King and the Sword.

711
01:11:01,320 --> 01:11:03,880
要號令天下，要管治人
{\fs12}If you want conquest the world,order others.

712
01:11:04,560 --> 01:11:06,437
就要果斷、無情
{\fs12}You must be cool and cold-blood

713
01:11:07,400 --> 01:11:10,756
有這種性格才可以駕馭神劍
{\fs12}With that,you might be control the Sword.

714
01:11:12,360 --> 01:11:14,476
別以為一個乳臭未乾的孩子
{\fs12}Never thought a kid

715
01:11:14,880 --> 01:11:17,235
拿到把劍就可以對付我
{\fs12}can fight me with the Sword.

716
01:11:17,760 --> 01:11:19,910
簡直是自掘墳墓
{\fs12}It's killing himself.

717
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:26,991
大祭司，對不起
{\fs12}Flamen,I'm sorry.

718
01:11:27,920 --> 01:11:28,875
我不配做玄機使
{\fs12}I'm not good enough to be an emissary.

719
01:11:29,280 --> 01:11:32,636
不用說了，你的雙眼已經告訴我
{\fs12}Stop sayying that,your eyes already told me.

720
01:11:33,200 --> 01:11:35,953
任務失敗，是因為你動了情
{\fs12}You failed becouse you move your emotion.

721
01:11:38,200 --> 01:11:39,349
我沒用
{\fs12}I'm useless.

722
01:11:39,880 --> 01:11:40,756
你走吧
{\fs12}You go.

723
01:11:51,160 --> 01:11:52,957
為什麼女皇對你那麼差
{\fs12}Why queen do that with you

724
01:11:53,360 --> 01:11:54,759
你還留在她身邊？
{\fs12}You still stay together with her?

725
01:11:56,840 --> 01:11:58,592
為自己喜歡的人付出
{\fs12}Pay for the one I like

726
01:11:59,080 --> 01:12:00,308
是很自然的事
{\fs12}It's a naturally thing.

727
01:12:21,080 --> 01:12:23,992
十三大爺，舒不舒服？
{\fs12}13th Master,do you feel good?

728
01:12:25,520 --> 01:12:26,873
你把你的手拿開好不好？
{\fs12}Can you remove your hand from me?

729
01:12:27,760 --> 01:12:29,591
我看到你就不舒服
{\fs12}I'm so sick with you.

730
01:12:29,880 --> 01:12:33,759
真的？那我們玩醫生病人遊戲吧
{\fs12}Really?Then we could play doctor and patient game.

731
01:12:34,040 --> 01:12:37,112

{\fs12}I'm so good to be a doctor,cough.

732
01:12:37,280 --> 01:12:38,599
滾開你！
{\fs12}Get out!

733
01:12:38,800 --> 01:12:40,677
什麼醫生病人，亂七八糟
{\fs12}What fuck the doctor and patient game.

734
01:12:45,520 --> 01:12:46,509
他叫「踏浪而來」
{\fs12}His name is "Come with waves".

735
01:12:46,960 --> 01:12:49,520

換人啊！
{\fs12}Someone change!

740
01:13:07,120 --> 01:13:08,678
大家都認識，何必那麼絕？
{\fs12}Why you doing that?We know each other?

741
01:13:09,480 --> 01:13:11,710
那你就當什麼都沒發生過
把我當成那種…
{\fs12}You can thought nothing happened
And thought me like...

742
01:13:12,080 --> 01:13:14,640
風流不羈，冷酷無情的浪子
{\fs12}Handsome man.

743
01:13:15,560 --> 01:13:16,470
這樣才對
{\fs12}That's right.

744
01:13:17,400 --> 01:13:19,834
我又沒錢，又不是皇帝
{\fs12}I'm poor,and not the king.

745
01:13:20,800 --> 01:13:22,358
我是牛郎！
{\fs12}I'm cowboy!

746
01:13:24,560 --> 01:13:25,276
喝酒吧
{\fs12}Just drink.

747
01:13:26,680 --> 01:13:28,079
自甘墮落
{\fs12}Corrup yourself.

748
01:13:28,680 --> 01:13:29,510
你好虛偽
{\fs12}You so hypocritical.

749
01:13:30,400 --> 01:13:33,312
你當初也是想抓我當鈴鐺來賣嘛
{\fs12}You just want to sell me at first.

750
01:13:34,320 --> 01:13:36,993

751
01:13:37,320 --> 01:13:38,230
你不要錢？
{\fs12}You don't want money?

752
01:13:39,280 --> 01:13:42,829
好啊！那我現在就抓你去賣給

{\fs12}Ok!I'll catch you and sell to fat genera Edo Bowman.

{\fs12}Nice,then I don't need to worry anything in my life.

754
01:13:46,440 --> 01:13:47,509

760
01:13:58,720 --> 01:14:01,678
你幫我找的男人，找到沒有？
{\fs12}Did you find the man?

761
01:14:02,040 --> 01:14:04,918

{\fs12}If you still can't find him,your business...

762
01:14:05,440 --> 01:14:06,350
我當然找到了
{\fs12}Of course I found him.

767
01:14:38,640 --> 01:14:39,993
不知道！
{\fs12}I don't know!

768

你還跑？
{\fs12}Still run away?

01:15:06,560 --> 01:15:08,630
我就是你要找的夢中情人

771
01:15:09,200 --> 01:15:11,395

{\fs12}Shut up!

773
01:15:13,520 --> 01:15:15,829
你好大的膽子！敢這樣跟我說話？
{\fs12}You so dare to talk me like that?

774
01:15:17,760 --> 01:15:21,309
你以為隨便找個人
應付應付我就行了？
{\fs12}You thought I'm ok with anyone?

775
01:15:23,280 --> 01:15:24,679
他不是你要找的人嗎？
{\fs12}Is he not the one you looking for?

776
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:26,796
不過…
{\fs12}But...

777
01:15:27,640 --> 01:15:29,631
他也有一點點男人味
{\fs12}He like man too.

778
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:33,230
帶他回去！算是利息
{\fs12}Take him back!

779
01:15:36,240 --> 01:15:37,275
你說帶就帶？
{\fs12}You can't order me.

780
01:15:38,200 --> 01:15:39,792
他現在是我的
{\fs12}Now he is mine.

781
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:41,558
你愛上了鈴鐺？
{\fs12}You fall in love with Bells?

782
01:15:41,840 --> 01:15:42,909
對啊…
{\fs12}Yes...

783
01:15:43,120 --> 01:15:44,917
我就是愛上了鈴鐺，怎麼樣？
{\fs12}I'm fall in love with Bells.

784
01:15:47,160 --> 01:15:49,515
鈴鐺老闆…愛上了鈴鐺…
{\fs12}Bells Boss love Bells...

785
01:15:53,680 --> 01:15:56,035
很好笑嗎？不行啊？
{\fs12}Is that funny?Can't I?

786
01:15:56,280 --> 01:15:58,794
你的生意不用做了，全部充公！
{\fs12}You can't do your business any more!

787
01:15:59,720 --> 01:16:01,597
充死你好了，我還不想幹呢
{\fs12}You go to hell,and I just don't wanna do it anymore!

788
01:16:24,520 --> 01:16:25,714
你現在跟我一樣窮了
{\fs12}Now you poor like me.

789
01:16:29,880 --> 01:16:33,555
誰說的？我還有你
{\fs12}Who said?I still have you

790
01:16:34,280 --> 01:16:36,919
我把你當成鈴鐺賣了…
{\fs12}I sell you as bells

791
01:16:37,200 --> 01:16:38,349
不就有錢了
{\fs12}then I'll get money.

792
01:16:39,920 --> 01:16:41,512
你捨得？
{\fs12}You will?

793
01:16:47,560 --> 01:16:49,437
捨得
{\fs12}Yes.

794
01:16:59,240 --> 01:16:59,797
你跑來幹嘛？
{\fs12}What are you doing here?

795
01:17:00,680 --> 01:17:02,636
我想跟你說
我已經不是女帝的人了
{\fs12}I want talk to you.
Now I'm not Queen's man

796
01:17:04,280 --> 01:17:06,999
還有，我希望你們通知炭頭
{\fs12}And,I hope you can notify Charcoal Head

797
01:17:07,360 --> 01:17:10,432
即使他拿到神劍，也打不過女帝的
{\fs12}Even he got the Sword,he still can't fight with Queen.

798
01:17:10,920 --> 01:17:12,478
叫他不要去送死
{\fs12}Tell him don't kill himself.

799
01:17:15,840 --> 01:17:17,592
不管是真是假，趕快通知炭頭
{\fs12}I don't it was true or fake,just notify Charcoal Head

800
01:17:17,840 --> 01:17:19,512
好不好？走！
{\fs12}Ok?Let's go!

801
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:22,353
你穿成這樣怎麼走？
{\fs12}How can we go with that dress?

802
01:17:23,440 --> 01:17:24,429
我不是很漂亮嗎？
{\fs12}Am i pretty?

803
01:17:26,680 --> 01:17:27,749
好，快點！
{\fs12}Ok.hurry up!

804
01:18:08,520 --> 01:18:11,034
我早就知道她喜歡上帝皇星
{\fs12}I already know she like king.

805
01:18:13,120 --> 01:18:14,394
帶他們去密室
{\fs12}Take them to secret chamber

806
01:18:27,040 --> 01:18:28,519
我果然沒有猜錯
{\fs12}I'm right.

807
01:18:28,760 --> 01:18:31,115
讓你動情的人就是帝皇星
{\fs12}The one who moves you is the king.

808
01:18:31,800 --> 01:18:32,949
你想引他來？
{\fs12}You wanna let him come here?

809
01:18:35,160 --> 01:18:37,833
大祭司，我求你放過他
{\fs12}Flamen,please let him go.

810
01:18:38,080 --> 01:18:40,116
他根本不是女皇的對手
{\fs12}He absolutely can't fight with Queen.

811
01:18:41,280 --> 01:18:44,033
我要的是那把神劍
{\fs12}I want that Sword.

812
01:18:44,480 --> 01:18:47,233
原來你想做皇帝
{\fs12}Its you who wanna be king.

813
01:18:48,280 --> 01:18:50,077
什麼皇帝？
{\fs12}King?

814
01:18:52,320 --> 01:18:55,869
兩生花開，帝皇星現
{\fs12}The flowers op,The Star of the King appears

815
01:18:56,200 --> 01:19:00,398

816
01:19:01,840 --> 01:19:03,273
兩生花…
{\fs12}The flowers...

817
01:19:04,160 --> 01:19:08,392
我要它開就開，要它謝就謝
{\fs12}it open and fad as my mind.

818
01:19:08,880 --> 01:19:12,236
姐姐，是我不好
{\fs12}Sister,Its my fault.

819
01:19:13,440 --> 01:19:16,113
尉繚他根本就沒有背叛過你
{\fs12}Nei Liao never betray you

820
01:19:16,600 --> 01:19:18,113
你原諒他吧
{\fs12}Forgive him.

821
01:19:18,680 --> 01:19:19,908
原諒？
{\fs12}Forgive?

822
01:19:20,880 --> 01:19:22,359
姐姐…
{\fs12}Sister...

823
01:19:26,240 --> 01:19:27,798
對不起
{\fs12}I'm sorry.

824
01:19:30,160 --> 01:19:32,196
我已經回不了頭了
{\fs12}I can't turn back

825
01:19:54,200 --> 01:19:57,237
只有你最瞭解我
{\fs12}You are the only one who know me

826
01:20:10,120 --> 01:20:13,590
你們兩個，一定要跟我一樣
{\fs12}You two,must same as me

827
01:20:14,680 --> 01:20:17,911
有多愛…就有多恨！
{\fs12}Love as your hate!

828
01:20:44,400 --> 01:20:45,594
各位部族的族長
{\fs12}Shaikh of each Tribe

829
01:20:46,280 --> 01:20:49,078
帝皇星，已經得到神劍了
{\fs12}The Star of the King already got the Sword.

830
01:20:49,280 --> 01:20:51,396
明天我們就可以殺進天女國
{\fs12}We can fight with Kingdom of Amazons tomorrow

831
01:20:51,800 --> 01:20:53,233
打倒那個女魔王
{\fs12}And

832
01:20:54,880 --> 01:20:56,871
你要我們跟那帝皇星去打仗？
{\fs12}You want us go war with The Star of the King?

833
01:20:57,680 --> 01:20:59,352
可是你看看他的樣子…
{\fs12}But did you see what he looks like...

834
01:20:59,880 --> 01:21:02,030
現在有得吃，有得住
只是受點女人氣
{\fs12}Now you get place to live,get food to eat.
Only have to endure women...

835
01:21:02,360 --> 01:21:03,998
打仗，連命都會沒了
{\fs12}War will let you die.

836
01:21:04,600 --> 01:21:06,238
命沒了還好一點
{\fs12}Even better than dead.

837
01:21:06,880 --> 01:21:08,552
如果你們弄得像我這樣…
{\fs12}If you like me...

838
01:21:09,320 --> 01:21:11,038
那可就慘了
{\fs12}That's too bad.

839
01:21:12,720 --> 01:21:15,598
黑木爺，是不是你？
{\fs12}Master Blackwood,is that you?

840
01:21:15,920 --> 01:21:18,150
你幫幫我…
{\fs12}Help me...

841
01:21:19,440 --> 01:21:21,476
你的事情我已經全知道了
{\fs12}I already know everything about you.

842
01:21:23,720 --> 01:21:26,154
我現在只想跟大家說幾句話
{\fs12}Now I just wanna have some words with you.

843
01:21:28,760 --> 01:21:29,431
你是什麼人？
{\fs12}Who are you?

844
01:21:30,960 --> 01:21:31,949
我不是人
{\fs12}I'm not human.

845
01:21:33,760 --> 01:21:35,034
我是一個怪物
{\fs12}I'm a monster.

846
01:21:35,720 --> 01:21:36,675
你在說什麼？
{\fs12}What are you talking about?

847
01:21:42,520 --> 01:21:44,476
炭頭，你不要怕
{\fs12}Charcoal Head,don't be scared.

848
01:22:04,960 --> 01:22:05,915
你們看到了
{\fs12}You see.

849
01:22:07,920 --> 01:22:11,151
就是女魔王把我變成這個樣子
{\fs12}The Queen make me like this...

850
01:22:11,960 --> 01:22:13,678
她為了要把男人變成女人
{\fs12}She want to trun man to woman.

851
01:22:14,560 --> 01:22:16,278
所以把我抓去做實驗
{\fs12}So she experiment on me.

852
01:22:16,960 --> 01:22:18,951
卻弄得我不男不女
{\fs12}Now I don't sure I'm a man or a woman.

853
01:22:19,280 --> 01:22:21,430
如果你們再袖手旁觀不出手的話
{\fs12}If you just stay watch.

854
01:22:22,480 --> 01:22:25,950
下一個變成怪物的…可能是你！
{\fs12}Next one who becouse monster...might be you!

855
01:22:26,720 --> 01:22:31,032
是你！是你！也許會是你！
{\fs12}You!You!It might be you!

856
01:22:32,920 --> 01:22:35,229
那我們就兵分兩路，上下夾攻
{\fs12}We should separate our army,and assail from two sides.

857
01:22:35,680 --> 01:22:38,478
就算丟掉了自己的命，也要復國！
{\fs12}Even lost your life,you should restore your country!

858
01:22:42,560 --> 01:22:43,276
炭頭！
{\fs12}Charcoal Head!

859
01:22:44,480 --> 01:22:45,356
柴頭
{\fs12}Blockhead.

860
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:46,591
黑木爺
{\fs12}Master Blackwood.

861
01:22:48,520 --> 01:22:49,316
對不起
{\fs12}I'm sorry.

862
01:22:51,160 --> 01:22:51,797
先別說這個
{\fs12}Stop sayying that.

863
01:22:52,160 --> 01:22:54,594
藍翎和十三少被女皇的人抓走了
{\fs12}Blue and Spring was cought by Queen.

864
01:22:55,400 --> 01:22:56,913
炭頭，要做一個好皇帝…
{\fs12}Charcoal Head,to be a good king...

865
01:22:57,480 --> 01:22:59,072
是不會只顧自己的
{\fs12}You can't just care yourself.

866
01:23:06,520 --> 01:23:08,317
好！
{\fs12}Ok!

867
01:23:24,160 --> 01:23:25,070
出來！
{\fs12}Come out!

868
01:24:05,880 --> 01:24:09,031
我們既然敢來，就準備好要犧牲
{\fs12}We come here,already be ready for dead.

869
01:24:10,440 --> 01:24:11,316

{\fs12}Stop!

872
01:24:52,040 --> 01:24:53,109
依多波曼！
{\fs12}Edo Bowman!

873
01:24:54,720 --> 01:24:57,188
這個人，我是不會放過他的！
{\fs12}This man,I won't let him go next time.

874
01:25:14,960 --> 01:25:16,029
我想死你啦！
{\fs12}I miss you so much!

875
01:25:16,120 --> 01:25:19,556
我以為這一輩子再也見不到你了
{\fs12}I thought I can't see you in my life.

876
01:25:20,320 --> 01:25:23,790
不要哭，再哭就不美了
{\fs12}Don't cry.

877
01:25:24,640 --> 01:25:27,598
你的耳朵還是這麼性感
{\fs12}Your ear always so sexy.

878
01:25:29,960 --> 01:25:32,030
大庭廣眾，不要說得那麼肉麻
{\fs12}Before a big crowd,don't be sickeningly disgusting.

879
01:25:32,840 --> 01:25:34,717
大將軍，我們到底還打不打？
{\fs12}General,should we fight or not?

880
01:25:36,720 --> 01:25:38,551
不打…
{\fs12}No...

881
01:25:38,720 --> 01:25:41,598
打！一定要打！
{\fs12}Fight!We must fight!

882
01:25:42,160 --> 01:25:43,878
不過我們是聯手去打
{\fs12}However we should fight together.

883
01:25:44,880 --> 01:25:46,472
只要推翻這個女魔王
{\fs12}If we overturn the Devil.

884
01:25:46,840 --> 01:25:49,149
我們就可以過一些正常生活了
{\fs12}We'll have normal life.

885
01:25:49,560 --> 01:25:50,834
大家不用擔心
Don't worry.

886
01:25:51,480 --> 01:25:56,076
我們要推翻的是女魔王
不是女人
{\fs12}We overturn the Devil.Not woman.

887
01:25:57,080 --> 01:26:01,471
將來的世界是男女平等
人人都有自由
{\fs12}The furture world have the equality of men and women.
Everyone have freedom.

888
01:26:02,360 --> 01:26:05,352
有愛情，大家敢愛敢恨
{\fs12}With love.

889
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:07,399
好！

896
01:27:05,680 --> 01:27:08,274
我不走，好不容易才跟你在一起
{\fs12}I won't leave,it's so hard to get together with you.

897
01:27:08,640 --> 01:27:10,358
不管變成什麼我都不走！
{\fs12}I'll never leave!

898
01:27:50,280 --> 01:27:52,191
皇上，過了這道門就是皇宮了
{\fs12}King,there is the palace

899
01:28:19,200 --> 01:28:20,189

你沒事吧？
{\fs12}Are you all right?

930
01:33:58,640 --> 01:34:00,756
不知道誰用麻袋套著我的頭來打我
{\fs12}Don't know who hit me with a gunny-bag cover my head.

931
01:34:00,960 --> 01:34:02,678
你看，都把我掐紫了
{\fs12}You see?Already injured me!

炭頭，快去把神劍拿回來
{\fs12}Charcoal Head,take that Sword back.

937
01:34:18,680 --> 01:34:20,398
千萬不能讓女皇拿到神劍！
{\fs12}Never ever let Queen get the Sword.

938

01:34:52,320 --> 01:34:54,629
我攔住女皇，快！

943
01:36:09,280 --> 01:36:10,759
你走開！

944
01:36:18,840 --> 01:36:21,912

{\fs12}Charcoal Head.hold on.hold on.

945
01:36:22,880 --> 01:36:24,359
好冷啊…

946
01:36:30,600 --> 01:36:31,430
你沒事吧？
{\fs12}Are you ok?

947
01:36:33,440 --> 01:36:34,475
挺住
{\fs12}Hold on...

948
01:36:36,480 --> 01:36:37,151
我們可以的…
{\fs12}We can make it...

949
01:36:37,720 --> 01:36:38,675
可以的
{\fs12}We can.

950
01:36:39,720 --> 01:36:41,517
來！    我們可以的！
{\fs12}We can make it!

951
01:37:38,120 --> 01:37:39,792
炭頭！不要！
{\fs12}Charcoal Head!No!

952
01:37:42,440 --> 01:37:43,714
捨不得啊？
{\fs12}Reluctant to give up?

953
01:37:44,640 --> 01:37:49,270
為了一個欺騙過你的人
你會放棄全世界？
{\fs12}Because a man who cheated you,
you'll give up the world?

954
01:37:50,600 --> 01:37:52,670
連自己的命都不要？
{\fs12}Even give up your life?

955
01:37:54,280 --> 01:37:56,919
炭頭，不要管我，砍下來！
{\fs12}Charcoal Head,just cut it off!

956
01:37:58,440 --> 01:37:59,919
我不想死！
{\fs12}I don't wanna die!

957
01:38:14,880 --> 01:38:16,791
又多了一個沒用的男人
{\fs12}One more usless guy

958
01:38:17,080 --> 01:38:17,796
尉繚
{\fs12}Nei Liao

959
01:38:18,440 --> 01:38:22,035
你教他把神劍拿起來
{\fs12}You teach him how to take the Sword.

960
01:38:22,200 --> 01:38:24,475
學你那樣，閹了自己
{\fs12}Just like you,castrate yourself

961
01:38:24,840 --> 01:38:27,638
也許…我就不會殺他
{\fs12}Mabye...I'll let him go.

962
01:38:27,920 --> 01:38:29,478
她已經準備為你犧牲
{\fs12}She had ready to die for you.

963
01:38:31,120 --> 01:38:33,395
你還不用神劍消滅女皇
{\fs12}Why don't you kill Queen with Sword?

964
01:38:34,680 --> 01:38:37,353
女皇的怨恨會讓藍翎永遠痛苦
{\fs12}Queen will hate Bule forever.

965
01:38:37,920 --> 01:38:41,230
對啊，要愛就要犧牲自己
{\fs12}You are right,you have to sacrifice if you wanna have love.

966
01:38:42,040 --> 01:38:44,076
炭頭，不要把劍交給尉繚
{\fs12}Charcoal Head,don't give the Sword to Nei Liao

967
01:38:44,280 --> 01:38:45,952
他是要拿劍做皇帝！
{\fs12}He need the Sword to be king.

968
01:38:50,880 --> 01:38:54,236
你一直都在欺騙我？
{\fs12}You cheat me all the time?

969
01:38:57,200 --> 01:38:59,668
你一直都在欺騙我？
{\fs12}You cheat me all the time?

970
01:39:00,600 --> 01:39:02,113
再晚就沒機會了
{\fs12}Its the last chance.

971
01:39:03,360 --> 01:39:05,749
你一直都在欺騙我！
{\fs12}You cheat me all the time!

972
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:08,070
閉上眼睛，我會幫你
{\fs12}Close your eye,I'll help you.

973
01:39:08,280 --> 01:39:09,474
把劍拿起來！
{\fs12}Take that Sword!

974
01:39:37,320 --> 01:39:38,912
藍翎，你有沒有事？
{\fs12}Blue,are you all right?

975
01:39:41,080 --> 01:39:42,308
沒事
{\fs12}I'm ok.

976
01:39:51,160 --> 01:39:52,832
只有這樣…
{\fs12}Only with that...

977
01:39:54,760 --> 01:39:57,433
你才能變回原來的雅歌
{\fs12}How could you get back to the original YEGE.

978
01:40:03,840 --> 01:40:04,670
別怕
{\fs12}Don't be scared.

979
01:40:06,320 --> 01:40:08,436
我會一直在你身邊
{\fs12}I'm here.

980
01:40:09,160 --> 01:40:10,718
不會離開你
{\fs12}I won't leave you.

981
01:40:13,480 --> 01:40:15,550
永遠都不會
{\fs12}Never.

982
01:40:19,760 --> 01:40:21,557
我沒騙過你…
{\fs12}I never cheat you...

983
01:40:24,680 --> 01:40:26,272
一次都沒有
{\fs12}Even one time.

984
01:41:42,280 --> 01:41:43,395
變什麼沒關係…
{\fs12}It's ok to change...

985
01:41:44,520 --> 01:41:45,555
你先起來一下
{\fs12}Get up.

986
01:41:46,400 --> 01:41:48,436
我受不了啦…
{\fs12}I can't handle it...

987
01:41:55,920 --> 01:41:59,674
變…變什麼？
{\fs12}Change...what?

988
01:42:03,120 --> 01:42:04,473
沒有了…
{\fs12}It's gone...

989
01:42:06,480 --> 01:42:07,913
沒有了！
{\fs12}It's gone!

990
01:42:08,320 --> 01:42:11,437
一定是炭頭打贏了…
{\fs12}Charcoal Head win...

991
01:42:11,600 --> 01:42:13,113
我沒事了！
{\fs12}I'm ok!

992
01:42:25,200 --> 01:42:26,235
那個炭頭真有一套
{\fs12}Charcoal Head so good.

993
01:42:26,800 --> 01:42:28,836
放著皇帝不做，跑去享受人生
{\fs12}He don't wanna be a King.

994
01:42:29,120 --> 01:42:30,553
留下一個國家讓我一個人管
{\fs12}And leave all the country to me.

995
01:42:30,880 --> 01:42:32,074
對啊，真過癮
{\fs12}ya,so cool.

996
01:42:32,400 --> 01:42:34,994
沒想到叉著雙手
就可以一輩子不用做事
{\fs12}I can't image I don't need to work in my life.

997
01:42:36,120 --> 01:42:37,872
不如我們輪流吧
我一三五，你二四六
{\fs12}Hmm,Why don't we take turns?
You have 1,3,5 I have 2,4,6.

998
01:42:38,800 --> 01:42:39,789
我才不幹呢
{\fs12}No way!

999
01:42:40,280 --> 01:42:42,191
這麼種的活當然是你們男人去做
{\fs12}It was man's job.

1000
01:42:42,680 --> 01:42:43,396
不行
{\fs12}No way.

1001
01:42:44,480 --> 01:42:47,472
還是要趕快跟你做個皇子出來
分擔才行
{\fs12}It's better to have a son
He'll do some work.

1002
01:42:49,160 --> 01:42:50,752
好啊，什麼時候？
{\fs12}Ok,when?

1003
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:51,716
不如現在
{\fs12}Now.

1004
01:42:52,360 --> 01:42:53,315
現在？    對啊
{\fs12}-Now?
-ya.

1005
01:42:53,760 --> 01:42:55,478
現在怎麼做？那麼多人
{\fs12}What should we do now?So many peple there.

1006
01:42:56,200 --> 01:42:58,634
沒關係，我是皇帝嘛
{\fs12}It's ok,I'm the king.

1007
01:43:01,080 --> 01:43:03,514
以後的事，就交給你們年青人了
{\fs12}I'll leave everything to you youngs.

1008
01:43:08,520 --> 01:43:09,669
漂亮吧？
{\fs12}Pretty?

1009
01:43:10,520 --> 01:43:12,556
是很漂亮，不過太冷了一點
{\fs12}Yes pretty,but a little cold.

1010
01:43:13,480 --> 01:43:14,151
就快到了
{\fs12}Almost there.

1011
01:43:25,480 --> 01:43:26,879
他們生了對雙胞胎！
{\fs12}They have twins now!

1012
01:43:27,400 --> 01:43:29,675
這怎麼行，我們也得做點事情
{\fs12}We should do somthing too.

1013
01:43:30,160 --> 01:43:31,388
做你的頭！
{\fs12}With what?

1014
01:43:32,600 --> 01:43:34,830
你為什麼不做皇帝
要和我在一起？
{\fs12}Why you don't wanna be a King?
You need stay together with me?

1015
01:43:35,680 --> 01:43:36,476
你知道
{\fs12}You know that

1016
01:43:37,000 --> 01:43:38,991
你不說，我會不記得
{\fs12}If you don't say,I'll never remember it.

1017
01:43:40,240 --> 01:43:43,550
喜歡你…
喜歡得連皇帝都沒時間做了
{\fs12}I like you so much,even have no time to be a king.

1018
01:43:45,520 --> 01:43:47,670
傻瓜，那我們走吧
{\fs12}Fool.Let's go.

1019
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:49,194
