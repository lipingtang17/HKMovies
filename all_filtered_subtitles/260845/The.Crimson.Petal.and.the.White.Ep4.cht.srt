00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:02,796
這是本仇恨的書 用來報復每個外強中乾的
It's a book of hate, to wreak revenge on every pompous

2
00:00:02,831 --> 00:00:04,976
爬上卡特韋夫人門檻的小爬蟲
trembling worm who taps at Mrs Castaway's door!

3
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:07,125
你是...?      蘇糖就是我的姓名
And you are? Sugar is all there is to my name.

4
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:09,040
你的人生從今以後就不同了
Your life is going to be very different from now on.

5
00:00:09,075 --> 00:00:12,360
我想讓你搬到切普斯托路去
I would like you to move to Chepstow Villas.

6
00:00:12,395 --> 00:00:14,885
和你住在一起?
To live in your house?

7
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:16,600
做索菲的家庭教師
And become Sophie's governess.

8
00:00:16,635 --> 00:00:18,685
十九年前      母親
19 years... Mother...

9
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:21,085
我們開始相依為命
.. since we embarked on this life together.

10
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:25,720
你的生活越來越神祕了 我眞好奇
Your life is becoming quite shrouded in mystery. I am so curious.

11
00:00:25,755 --> 00:00:27,417
那位女士是誰 索菲?
Who is that lady, Sophie?

12
00:00:27,452 --> 00:00:29,045
艾格尼絲 你幹什麼了?
Agnes, what have you done?

13
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:31,120
求你 我準備好了 救我走
Please, I'm ready. Get me away!

14
00:00:31,155 --> 00:00:32,245
你是我唯一希望了
You're my only hope!

15
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:34,000
我還是你的小女孩嗎?
Am I still your little girl?

16
00:00:34,035 --> 00:00:36,117
對 當然是
Yes, of course you are.

17
00:00:36,152 --> 00:00:37,956
我不是瘋女人
I am not a madwoman!

18
00:00:37,991 --> 00:00:39,760
艾格尼絲還是得送走
Agnes is to be put away.

19
00:00:39,795 --> 00:00:40,805
可是威廉...
But, William...

20
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:43,920
再沒有人能傷害你了      時候到了?
No-one is going to hurt you any more. Is it time?

太激動了對你不好
It's worse when you excite yourself.

30
00:01:45,235 --> 00:01:47,565
...警察
.. the police!

31
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,805
我得報告警察
I have to tell the police.

32
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:52,400
艾格尼絲可能急需營救
Agnes may be in need of urgent rescue!

33
00:01:52,435 --> 00:01:53,444
當然 威廉 可...
Of course, William, but...

34
00:01:53,479 --> 00:01:55,809
這不是簡單的生死問題
It's not a simple question of being dead or alive.

35
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:57,960
她的處境可能生不如死
There is a fate worse than death.

36
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:05,078
可能就在此刻 一個卡特韋太太那樣的老錢婆
As we speak, some foul hag, such as your Mrs Castaway, could be

37
00:02:05,113 --> 00:02:07,600
正在把她往妓院裏送
installing her in some bawdy house!

38
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:12,680
艾格尼絲那麼虛弱 應該沒人會那樣利用她的
I'm quite sure Agnes is too frail to be made use of in that way.

39
00:02:12,715 --> 00:02:16,005
你沒讀過「狂歡指南」嗎?
Haven't you read More Sprees?

40
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:18,800
病入膏肓的女子也是一門生意呢
There's a nice little trade going in dying girls.

41
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,640
還是你忘光了?
Or perhaps you'd forgotten?

42
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:28,804
她老跟你嘮叨的這個「健康修院」
Where was this "Convent of Health"

43
00:02:28,839 --> 00:02:30,009
怎麼回事?
that she blathered onto you about?

44
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:34,560
我覺得 那不是現實存在的地方
Well, I'm not sure it was a place that had a physical reality.

45
00:02:34,595 --> 00:02:35,799
你知道她失蹤過吧?
You know she disappeared before?

46
00:02:35,834 --> 00:02:38,896
蘇糖小姐找到她的 一半腳趾都被雪凍掉了
Miss Sugar found her with half her toes sliced off in the snow.

47
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:41,240
蘇糖小姐?      女家庭教師
Miss Sugar? The governess.

48
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:44,405
她不是我們改造的女人吧?
She's not a rescue girl, is she?

49
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:46,605
天啊 説哪裏話 當然不是
Oh, for heaven's sake! Of course not.

50
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:49,200
艾米麗 你太沈迷這個了
Emmeline, you're becoming fixated on that subject!

51
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:55,520
「讓我想想 早晨就覺得」(愛麗絲夢遊仙境)
Let me think. I always think I can remember feeling...

52
00:02:55,555 --> 00:02:57,245
「有點不對頭」
a little different.

53
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:01,200
「可如果我不是自己 接着就該問」
But if I am not the same, the next question is,

54
00:03:01,235 --> 00:03:02,880
「我能是誰呢?」
who in the world am I?

55
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,645
「唉 眞是個謎呀」
That's the great puzzle.

56
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,120
很高興你喜歡你的聖誕禮物書 索菲
I'm so glad you're enjoying your Christmas book, Sophie.

57
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:19,120
小姐 我媽媽還在逃跑嗎?
Miss, has my mama still run away?

58
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:22,245
對
Yes.

59
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:25,240
對 她還在逃跑      到歷史了嗎?
Yes, she has. Is it history now?

60
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:31,200
你説什麼?      歷史 亨利八世?
I beg your pardon? History? Henry VIII?

61
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:40,085
不 我記得先是地理
Er, no, geography first, I think.

62
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:44,760
給我畫幾個澳大利亞的動物好不好?
Why don't you draw me some animals from Australia?

63
00:03:44,795 --> 00:03:46,920
你和艾格尼絲親近嗎?
Were you and Agnes close?

64
00:03:46,955 --> 00:03:48,525
親近?
Close?

65
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,320
我們基本不認識
We barely knew each other.

66
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:55,508
她告訴克拉拉 在雪地裏找到她的
She told Clara the person who f... f... found her in the snow

67
00:03:55,543 --> 00:03:57,766
是她唯一的朋友
was her only friend in the world.

68
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:01,800
她當時神志不清
She was very disturbed.

69
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:06,040
我只是送她回房而已
I merely escorted her back to the house.

70
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,920
她根本不認識你
She didn't know you at all,

71
00:04:10,955 --> 00:04:12,440
可是卻信任你?
yet she trusted you?

72
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:17,120
她也沒理由不信啊
Well, she had no reason not to.

73
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:37,965
小姐      嗯?
Miss. U-hum?

74
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,345
亨利八世這麼想要兒子
If Henry VllI wanted a son so badly,

75
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:43,270
為什麼不娶個有兒子的女士呢?
why didn't he marry a lady who already had one?

76
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:46,457
因為要做王儲
Because to be the king's true heir

77
00:04:46,492 --> 00:04:48,475
必須是國王的血脈
you need to be of the king's blood.

78
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,640
孩子是血做的嗎?
Are babies made of blood?

79
00:04:52,675 --> 00:04:54,400
不是
No.

80
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,800
孩子從這裏長出來
Babies are grown in here.

81
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,680
怎麼長出來?
How?

82
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,460
嗯 如果我有個丈夫
Well, if I had a husband,

83
00:05:08,495 --> 00:05:10,847
他會在我身體裏播種
he would plant a seed in me

84
00:05:10,882 --> 00:05:13,200
我就會懷上孩子
and I would have a baby.

85
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:18,360
那我是從媽媽體内來的?
I came out of Mama, then?

86
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,880
絳紅的花瓣睡了 (A·丁尼生 1847)
Now sleeps the crimson petal

87
00:05:29,915 --> 00:05:31,245
雪白的同眠去
Now the white

88
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:35,460
御道邊絲柏不再婆娑搖擺
Nor waves the cypress in the palace walk

89
00:05:35,495 --> 00:05:39,640
花崗岩池中不再波光粼粼
Nor winks the gold fin in the porphyry font

90
00:05:39,675 --> 00:05:43,840
螢火蟲醒來 喚醒了我和你
The firefly wakens Waken thou with me

91
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:49,240
乳白的孔雀收屏如鬼魅
Now droops the milk-white peacock like a ghost

92
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:55,157
魅影在我眼前明明滅滅
And like a ghost she glimmers unto me

93
00:05:55,192 --> 00:05:59,554
大地如達納厄 灑滿星光
Now lies the Earth All Danae to the stars

94
00:05:59,589 --> 00:06:02,520
你便與我心心相印
And all thy heart lies open unto me.

95
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:08,240
流星無聲掠過 只留下
Now slides the silent meteor on And leaves

96
00:06:08,275 --> 00:06:12,200
一條金線 如我對你的思念
a shining furrow as thy thoughts in me.

97
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:15,840
哦 萊蒂
Oh, Letty!

98
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,725
抱歉 我看書看睡着了
Sorry, I fell asleep, reading.

99
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:22,120
幾點了      沒事 還很早 不過
What time is it? No, it's early, only.

100
00:06:22,155 --> 00:06:25,400
拉克曼先生在找你
Mr Rackham was looking for you.

101
00:06:25,435 --> 00:06:27,200
他被叫走了
He's been fetched away.

102
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:36,640
這種環境裏 要辨認很困難 先生
Identification will be difficult in these circumstances, sir.

103
00:06:36,675 --> 00:06:40,800
請多注意那些沒腐爛的部分
Try and focus on the parts that are least corrupted.

104
00:06:40,835 --> 00:06:44,600
提醒您一句 別看眼睛
A word of warning, don't look for the eyes.

105
00:06:44,635 --> 00:06:49,400
都被鰻魚吃掉了      好的
Eels have them. All right.

106
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,600

It is she.

107
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,060
是我妻子
It is my wife.

108
00:07:05,095 --> 00:07:06,840
你肯定嗎 先生?
Are you sure, sir?

109
00:07:06,875 --> 00:07:09,560
我肯定
I'm sure.

110
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:14,800
把她蓋起來
Cover her up!

111
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,440
小心 小心
Steady, steady.

112
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,440
好了 先生
All right, sir.

113

我們的肉體終會歸於塵土
Ashes and dust are our only material remains.

120
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:02,200
和精神遺産相比 肉體不値一提
Compared to our spiritual remains, they mean nothing.

拉克曼夫人的殘軀...

您眞是個非常 非常勇敢的人

我聽説索菲找到家庭教師了
I heard Sophie had a new governess.

124

難怪她這麼開心呢
I wonder to see her so happy!

125

00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:23,120
我的同事聽到將會多麼受傷啊
how mortified my colleagues would be to hear you say that.

137
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,469
恕我失陪 福克斯太太
If you will excuse me, Mrs Fox,

138
00:09:33,504 --> 00:09:36,829
我今天應該看着索菲的      當然
I do think I should keep a close eye on Sophie today. Of course.

139
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:41,125
一起走走吧
Let's walk together.

140
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:46,240
我們社團的宗旨是改造妓女
We are an organisation committed to reforming prostitutes.

141
00:09:46,275 --> 00:09:49,627
刻不容緩 每天都有婦女因
The urgency is great. Women die or disappear

142
00:09:49,662 --> 00:09:52,980
生病 謀殺或自殺而死去 失蹤
every day through disease, murder, suicide.

143
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:55,402
昨天我剛去過一間妓院
Just yesterday, I visited a house,

144
00:09:55,437 --> 00:09:57,530
老鴇叫卡特韋太太
a place known as Mrs Castaway's,

145
00:09:57,565 --> 00:10:00,840
去找我在一本可恥的讀物上看到的女孩
looking for a girl I'd read about in a vile publication.

146
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,400
找到什麼了?
What did you find there?

147
00:10:05,435 --> 00:10:07,657
那女孩早就不在了
The girl was long gone.

148
00:10:07,692 --> 00:10:09,845
誰也不知她的去向
No one could say where.

149
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:12,080
卡特韋太太本人也死了
And Mrs Castaway herself had died.

150
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:17,494
死了?      新老鴇這麼説的
Died? So the new madam said,

151
00:10:17,529 --> 00:10:19,603
然後給我吃了閉門羹
before she slammed the door in my face.

152
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,560
抱歉 蘇糖小姐
Forgive me, Miss Sugar.

153
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:36,725
哦 你喜歡你當初的老鴇
Oh, you were fond of your old madam.

154
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:41,080
是我太自大 沒考慮到這點 我眞傻
In my arrogance, I failed to imagine that. What an imbecile I am.

155
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,685
你想要什麼?
What do you want?

156
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:51,040
我想要證實你是誰
I wanted to verify who you were.

157
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,605
我是誰?
Who am I?

158
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:58,560
一個找到方向 並且不辱使命的女人
A young woman who has found her calling and means to excel at it.

159
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:04,120
有需要隨時找我
If I can ever be of service.

160
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:08,160
克里斯托弗?
Christopher?

161
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:14,325
你走錯了吧
I think you've mistaken your way.

162
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:17,600
我在找這裏原來開門的小男孩
I was looking for the little boy who used to answer the door.

163
00:12:17,635 --> 00:12:20,937
要找小男孩的 叫他去找塔伯特夫人
If it's little boys he's after, send him to Mrs Talbot's.

164
00:12:20,972 --> 00:12:24,240
不是男人 親愛的 是救濟社來的女士
It's not a man, dear, it's a lady from the Rescue Society.

165
00:12:24,275 --> 00:12:26,697
我叫蘇糖
My name is Sugar.

166
00:12:26,732 --> 00:12:29,120
我原來在這工作
I used to work here.

167
00:12:29,155 --> 00:12:30,925
蘇糖?
Sugar?

168
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,605
不會吧...
I would never have...

169
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:34,725
快進來 親愛的 進來
Oh, well come in, dear, come in.

170
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:36,763
前幾天還有人找你呢
Someone was asking for you only a couple of days ago.

171
00:12:36,798 --> 00:12:38,508
你多傳奇呀
Your fame endures!

172
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:46,640
大變樣了對吧?
Quite a change, isn't it?

173
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:55,565
我能和艾米説句話嗎?
May I have a word with Amy?

174
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,680
原來拉大提琴的姑娘
The girl who used to play the cello.

175
00:12:57,715 --> 00:12:58,813
唉 艾米覺得我們這裏
Alas, Amy felt our house had

176
00:12:58,848 --> 00:13:01,451
太專業 讓她屈才了
become too specialised for her talents.

177
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:04,080
帶那男孩走了 去哪我不記得了
Took the boy with her. Quite where escapes me.

178
00:13:04,115 --> 00:13:06,525
這麼多新窯子 誰記得住啊
So many new houses, one can hardly keep up.

179
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:10,766
艾米走了 我也可以説不再上工了
With Amy gone and me no longer on what you call the factory floor

180
00:13:10,801 --> 00:13:12,737
我們又少兩個姑娘
we're two girls down.

181
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:15,160
我是來打聽我...
I came to ask about my...

182
00:13:15,195 --> 00:13:18,477
打聽卡特韋太太的
About Mrs Castaway.

183
00:13:18,512 --> 00:13:22,036
哦 她死了 親愛的
Oh, she passed, dear.

184
00:13:22,071 --> 00:13:25,560
怎麼了 她怎麼死的?
But how? How did she die?

185
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:29,165
睡過去就沒醒 親愛的
In her sleep, dear.

186
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:32,000
她給我留什麼了嗎?
Did she leave anything for me?

187
00:13:32,035 --> 00:13:35,245
一封信 一句話?
A letter, a message?

188
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:40,320
發現她死了之後呢
And what happened to her after she was found,

189
00:13:40,355 --> 00:13:43,645
屍體呢?
her remains?

190
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:46,325
管喪事的擡走了 對吧 親愛的?
Undertakers took her away. Isn't that right, dear?

191
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:51,440
哦 沒問題 魯克斯 布魯克斯 類似的名字
Oh, I believe so. Rookes, Brookes, something like that. Aww.

192
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:56,560
再路過這裏 記得回來玩哦
Well, do call in again, dear, if you're passing.

193
00:13:56,595 --> 00:13:59,445
見到你眞好
A charm to see you.

194
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:01,160
你整個人都變了
You do look different.

195
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:06,100
我的生活全變了      是嗎?
My life is very different now. Is it?

196
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:13,205
你長胖了 不是嗎?      眞的
You've filled out so! Ain't she? Indeed.

197
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:15,800
其實我還想問 有什麼要告訴我們的嗎?
In fact, I wonder, is there something we should know?

198
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:55,400
蘇糖小姐 拉克曼先生問您回來沒有
Miss Sugar, Mr Rackham was asking if you were back.

199
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,840
你會縫紉嗎?
Can you sew?

200
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:06,680
縫紉?      對 你會把艾格尼絲的裙子
Sew? Yes, could you alter a dress of Agnes's so that it'd

201
00:15:06,715 --> 00:15:08,200
改成你的嗎?
fit you?

202
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:14,085
呃 這我不會
Er, no I, I don't think so.

203
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:17,640
就算我會裁縫 艾格尼絲和我
Erm, even if I were a seamstress, Agnes and I were

204
00:15:17,675 --> 00:15:19,165
體型完全不同
very different shapes.

205
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:21,747
眞可惜 我還打算明天下午
Shame. I'd arranged for us all to go on

206
00:15:21,782 --> 00:15:25,326
全家一起出去的
a little outing together tomorrow afternoon.

207
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:30,200
全家?      你 我和索菲 去照相館
Us all? You, me and Sophie. To the photographer's studio.

208
00:15:30,235 --> 00:15:31,960
照全家福
A family portrait.

209
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,920
早安 先生
Good day, Sir.

210
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:41,365
托維先生
Mr Tovey.

211
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:45,080
夫人 這邊請
Madam. This way.

212
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:51,360
索菲
Sophie.

213
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:05,360
這裙子一定是縮水了
This dress must have shrunk.

214
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:32,930
我現在要從天空召喚大象
I shall now summon an elephant from the sky

215
00:16:32,965 --> 00:16:36,790
讓它站在我鼻尖上
and balance it on the tip of my nose.

216
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:40,800
三 二 一
Three, two, one.

217
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:43,480
太棒了
Marvellous.

218
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:31,725
你好 索菲      爸爸?
Hello, Sophie. Papa?

219
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,400
我給你帶了禮物
I have something for you.

220
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:48,880
你覺得怎樣?      威廉?
Well, what do you think? William?

221
00:17:48,915 --> 00:17:51,485
眞是個驚喜
What a pleasant surprise.

222
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:54,180
蘇糖小姐 看      哦 索菲
Miss Sugar, see here. Oh, Sophie.

223
00:17:54,215 --> 00:17:56,840
像眞的一樣       眞棒 索菲
I look real! It's wonderful, Sophie!

224
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:00,703
大團圓照呢?
And what of the group portrait?

225
00:18:00,738 --> 00:18:02,292
我們一起照的那張?
The one of all of us together?

226
00:18:02,327 --> 00:18:05,436
可惜不太成功      唉 天啊
It wasn't a success, I'm afraid. Oh, dear.

227
00:18:05,471 --> 00:18:08,545
不然改天再去試試?
Perhaps we can try again another day?

228
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:10,919
好的 索菲 改天再試
Yes, Sophie. Perhaps we will.

229
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:15,840
當然 這很冒險 機器剛發明出來
It is a risk, of course. The engineering is in its infancy.

230
00:18:15,875 --> 00:18:17,612
還照老辦法吧
Leave things as they are.

231
00:18:17,647 --> 00:18:19,314
你的投資要回本
To recoup your investment

232
00:18:19,349 --> 00:18:21,694
需要十年好收成
you'd need ten years' excellent harvests

233
00:18:21,729 --> 00:18:24,040
並且你的競爭對手不能擴張
and no expansion from your competitors.

234
00:18:24,075 --> 00:18:25,165
唉...
Oh, it's...

235
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:28,056
下個世紀屬於梨牌和亞德利
The next century belongs to Pears and Yardley.

236
00:18:28,091 --> 00:18:29,701
我從骨子裏堅信
I can feel it in my bones.

237
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:33,160
而且我沒有繼承人...
And without an heir to succeed me...

238
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,680
眼下還沒有
Without an heir so far.

239
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,640
你正當盛年 威廉
You are a man in his prime, William.

240
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:47,240
還記得我們第一次見面嗎?
Do you remember when we first met?

241
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,880
我告訴你我會為你做任何事
I told you I would do anything for you.

242
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:07,280
我們該上床了      我正這麼想呢
We should be in bed. My thoughts exactly.

243
00:19:07,315 --> 00:19:09,525
不
No...

244
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:11,040
説眞的 看都幾點了
.. seriously. Look at the time.

245
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,440
你這個傻姑娘
You stupid, stupid girl.

246
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:28,280
你好 先生 你在找我嗎?
Hello, sir. Are you looking for me?

247
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:35,360
蘇糖?
Sugar?

248
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:40,080
是... 是你?
Is that... Is that you?

249
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:55,160
我聽説卡太太的事了
I had heard about Mrs C.

250
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:58,680
她幾時過世的? 你知道嗎?
When did she die? Do you know?

251
00:22:58,715 --> 00:23:00,925
有一陣了
A while ago.

252
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:04,720
她什麼都沒留給你 連封信也沒有?
She didn't leave you nothing? A letter, even?

253
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:07,560
眞遺憾
I'm sorry.

254
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:12,880
我愛過我母親
I loved my mother.

255
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:17,340
能用用你的痰盂嗎?      儘管用
Can I use your pot? Help yourself.

256
00:23:17,375 --> 00:23:19,840
哦 謝謝 還挺乾淨呢
Oh, thank you. It's even clean!

257
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,200
你不介意吧?
Would you mind?

258
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:37,680
我有時還點支蠟燭祭奠媽媽呢
Light a candle for her sometimes, my mum.

259
00:23:37,715 --> 00:23:39,205
當然不在教堂裏
Not in church!

260
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:44,760
就是這裏      能不能幫我把包裏的手絹拿來?
Just in here. Can you pass me a handkerchief from my bag?

261
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:55,080
你去買東西了? 薄荷油和啤酒酵母
You been shopping? Pennyroyal and brewer's yeast.

262
00:23:55,115 --> 00:23:56,800
給一個女僕的
One of the maids.

263
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,920
她試過鋅和硼砂?
She tried zinc and borax?

264
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:07,205
毫無用處
To no avail.

265
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:12,720
我最討厭這個 撕心裂肺的灼痛
I hate that the worst. Hurts like hell, the burnin'.

266
00:24:12,755 --> 00:24:14,240
可憐的姑娘
Poor girl.

267
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:16,640
對 很痛
Yes, it does.

268
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:22,680
這是什麼
What's this?

269
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:32,120
替我也點支蠟燭
Light a candle for me.

270
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:04,125
「那我是誰呀?」(愛麗絲漫遊仙境)
'Who am I, then?

271
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:07,520
「先得告訴我 如果變成我喜歡的人」
'Tell me that first, and then, if I like being that person,'

272
00:25:07,555 --> 00:25:09,365
「我就上來」
I'll come up.

273
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:12,400
「不然 我就待在這裏 除非再變成什麼人」
'If not, I'll stay down here till I'm somebody else.

274
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:20,160
抱歉 索菲
Oh, excuse me, Sophie.

275
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:23,680
我出去一會兒
I just need to go outside for a moment.

276
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,520
拉克曼先生
Mr Rackham!

277
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,440
拉克曼先生
Mr Rackham!

278
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:28,120
簡妮
Janey!

279
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:31,200
跟我來
Follow me.

280
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:04,960
威廉 眞對不起
Oh, William. I'm so sorry.

281
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:08,680
是科魯醫生
That will be Dr Curlew.

282
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:14,245
為我而來?      在床上別動
For me? Do not move from this bed.

283
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:16,800
這房子已受夠生病的女人了
We've had quite enough sick women in this house.

284
00:27:16,835 --> 00:27:18,240
我希望你好好的
I want you well.

285
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:28,680
人們從椅子上跌下 都會摔斷脖子
People break necks falling off a chair.

286
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:32,645
你從樓梯上跌下
You have fallen down a staircase

287
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:34,794
卻只扭傷了腳踝
and only have a badly sprained ankle

288
00:27:34,829 --> 00:27:36,909
留下一些瘀傷
and a number of bruises to show for it.

289
00:27:36,944 --> 00:27:40,480
你現在可能還沒發現瘀傷 但很快會察覺到的
You may not be aware of those bruises as yet, but you will be.

290
00:27:40,515 --> 00:27:41,993
儘量躺在床上休養
Keep to your bed as much as possible.

291
00:27:42,028 --> 00:27:43,612
我還有工作
I have duties to perform.

292
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:48,000
你的情況 最好...
It would be much better, in your condition...

293
00:27:48,035 --> 00:27:49,325
科魯醫生
Dr Curlew,

294
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:52,320
我是這家人僱來的
I am employed in this house.

295
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:57,480
進來
Enter.

296
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:03,440
病人如何了?
How is the patient?

297
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:12,240
狀態好極了 蘇糖小姐體質很好
Remarkably well. Miss Sugar is extremely robust.

298
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:31,600
你好 索菲 過來幫我拿拿書
Hello, Sophie. Here, take these books from me.

299
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:50,620
看在上帝的份上
Oh, for heaven's sake!

300
00:28:50,655 --> 00:28:53,977
你對我的狀況不好奇嗎?
Aren't you the least bit curious what happened to me?

301
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:57,397
萊蒂説你從很高的地方跌下來
Letty said that you fell down a long, long way

302
00:28:57,432 --> 00:28:59,272
我不能盯着看
and I mustn't stare.

303
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:02,700
我很快會好起來
I'll be better very soon.

304
00:29:02,735 --> 00:29:05,480
你爸爸現在越來越...
And now that your father...

305
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:10,137
自信能自己處理信函了
.. feels well enough to do his own correspondence,

306
00:29:10,172 --> 00:29:12,311
我們有更多的時間呆在一起了
you and I can spend more time together.

307
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:17,760
我想咱們到紐西蘭了
And I think we are in New Zealand.

308
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:23,481
「親愛的拉克...」 拉克
"Dear Rackers... " Rackers.

309
00:29:23,516 --> 00:29:26,208
「發生這種事我深表哀悼
"Deepest condolences aside,

310
00:29:26,243 --> 00:29:28,791
但你總沒死吧」
anyone would think it was you who were dead.

311
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:38,845
「這本新書是我們最棒的一本」
"The new book is our best yet. "

312
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:42,840
「藝術之於勞動人民」
Art As Understood By The Working Man.

313
00:29:42,875 --> 00:29:44,016
比別的都沒爭議吧!
Less contentious than usual!

314
00:29:44,016 --> 00:29:45,046
你別不相信!
Don't you believe it!

315
00:29:45,046 --> 00:29:47,784
看看這些粗活工人們
Look at that whole variety of rude working folk.

316
00:29:48,815 --> 00:29:49,736
掃煙囱的人 賣魚工
Chimney sweeps, fish-sellers,

317
00:29:49,736 --> 00:29:52,704
幫廚女工 小販們之類
kitchen-maids, costermongers, so forth.

318
00:29:53,075 --> 00:29:55,400
給他們看看名畫的雕版
And show them engravings of famous paintings.

319
00:29:55,435 --> 00:29:57,240
問問他們的意見!
Then ask them their opinion!

320
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:19,480
威廉 告訴我們你想對康絲緹斯做什麼
So, William, do tell us what you intend to do about Constance.

321
00:30:19,515 --> 00:30:21,036
康絲緹斯?     我們想知道
Constance? We're dying to hear.

322
00:30:21,036 --> 00:30:22,806
親愛的布利德樓夫人?
Our dear Lady Bridgelow.

323
00:30:23,555 --> 00:30:26,525
她怎麼了?      你不想和她結婚?
What about her? You don't want to marry her?

324
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:30,125
完全不知道她想和我結婚!
I had no idea that she had any desire to marry me!

325
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:32,193
拜託 比爾! 你想讓她
Come on, Bill! Do you expect her to

326
00:30:32,193 --> 00:30:34,244
跪下向你求婚嗎?
get down on bended knee and propose?

327
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:37,880
她也有自尊的
She has her pride!

328
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:46,340
所以 接下來想去哪呢?
So, what do you fancy?

329
00:30:46,375 --> 00:30:48,965
附近的特倫絲太太那裏?
Mrs Terence's is nearby?

330
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,487
威爾斯那女孩一定有主了
The Welsh one will be taken by now and

331
00:30:50,487 --> 00:30:53,767
其它人我看不上       福特太太那裏呢?
I don't much care for the others. Mrs Ford's?

332
00:30:53,802 --> 00:30:55,520
性價比太差
Expensive for what you get.

333
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:06,680
這幾個看上去不錯啊      我們快活着呢
These have a cheerful air about them. Nice weather we're having.

334
00:31:06,715 --> 00:31:10,840
你找不到比我更好的了 親愛的      我也是
You never had anyone like me, dear. Me neither!

335
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:19,720
口交 多少錢?
In the mouth. How much?

336
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:37,140
快點啊 先生      我今天沒有帶套
Go on, Sir. I don't have a sheath on me.

337
00:31:37,175 --> 00:31:39,160
我上週去看過醫生 先生
I went to the doctors last week, Sir.

338
00:31:39,195 --> 00:31:41,165
説我乾淨的像小貓
Says I'm as clean as a kitten.

339
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:44,160
可我...       我那裏美妙如絲綢 先生
Even so... I've got a fine, silky hole, sir.

340
00:31:44,195 --> 00:31:45,960
如同絶美的海螺
A connoisseur's conch.

341
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:38,160
比爾 你還好嗎?
Bill, are you with us?

342
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:45,040
吃了它 拉克
Well, eat it, Rackers!

343
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:51,680
威廉?
William?

344
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:58,160
你在這裏幹什麼?      我來幫你處理信件
What are you doing in here? I'm attending to your correspondence.

345
00:32:58,195 --> 00:33:02,200
你還好嗎 滿身是...
Are you all right? You're covered in...

346
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:07,920
你去哪了?
Where have you been?

347
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:11,640
噢 我怎麼會不知道?
Oh, I know, don't I?

348
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:14,720
我知道你去哪了
I know where you've been.

349
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:18,160
這與你無關!
That is none of your business!

350
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:24,280
給我瘸着回房間去
Just hobble off back to your room!

351
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:27,680
再也不需要你了
I have no further need for you.

352
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:32,440
走啊!
Go on!

353
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:01,005
「我究竟是誰?」
'Who am I?

354
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:04,991
「我叫蘇糖 你們眼中的失足婦女
'My name is Sugar. I am what you would call a fallen woman,

355
00:34:04,991 --> 00:34:08,078
可我會告訴你這不是失足」
but I assure you I did not fall.

356
00:34:08,395 --> 00:34:10,125
「我是被逼所至」
'I was pushed.

357
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:14,200
「卑劣的男人 永恆的亞當 我控訴你!」
'Vile man, eternal Adam, I indict you!'

358
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:35,360
請原諒      現在幾點了?
Please forgive me. What time is it?

359
00:34:35,395 --> 00:34:39,000
快黎明了 蘇糖 對不起
Almost dawn. Sugar, I am so sorry.

360
00:34:39,035 --> 00:34:42,600
我剛剛失控了
I wasn't myself before.

361
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:48,840
我喝醉了 癱倒在城裏
I collapsed in town, drunk.

362
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:51,920
丟盡了臉
A complete disgrace.

363
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:57,680
現在清醒了
I'm sober now.

364
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:03,965
再也不會發生這樣的事了
It will never happen again.

365
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:08,360
當然不會了 威廉      不 我下定決心了
Of course not, William. No, I am determined.

366
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:12,920
一切都會不同的
Things are going to be different.

367
00:35:12,955 --> 00:35:14,440
你會發現的
You'll see.

368
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:19,640
明天希望你和索菲一起
I would like you and Sophie to join me tomorrow

369
00:35:19,675 --> 00:35:21,640
來參觀我的香皂廠
on a visit of my soap factory.

370
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:27,800
不等你休養好再去嗎?
Wouldn't it be wiser to wait until after you're rested?

371
00:35:27,835 --> 00:35:30,520
因為還有個人要見
There's someone else I am meeting there,

372
00:35:30,555 --> 00:35:33,000
我不願意麻煩的人
someone I'm loath to inconvenience.

373
00:35:33,035 --> 00:35:34,685
明白了
I see.

374
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:36,960
你當然明白
Of course you do.

375
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:46,120
雖然我沒掛在嘴邊 可你眞是個寳貝
I have not told you often enough what a treasure you are.

376
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,920
你該去睡會兒覺了
You should get some sleep now.

377
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:43,020
小心點 車伕
Take care, Cheesman.

378
00:36:43,055 --> 00:36:44,720
我一直都是 蘇糖小姐
I always do, Miss Sugar.

379
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:59,640
你打扮的很美 索菲
You are very nicely turned out, Sophie.

380
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:07,840
看 索菲
Look, Sophie.

381
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:15,000
我們要見一個爸爸的生意夥伴
We're here to meet an associate of your father's.

382
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:23,677
不 怪我來的太早了
No, it is my fault for arriving early.

383
00:37:23,677 --> 00:37:26,111
實在太想見你了
I've been looking forward to it so much, you see.

384
00:37:26,755 --> 00:37:28,426
難得我的小小廠房
It's hard to believe my humble little factory

385
00:37:28,426 --> 00:37:29,752
能讓你付諸如此熱情
could inspire such enthusiasm.

386
00:37:29,752 --> 00:37:32,240
你不相信?
Do you doubt my word?

387
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,499
當然 你所看到的
Of course, what you see here is

388
00:37:36,499 --> 00:37:39,722
不算是熬肥皂
not exactly soap manufacture, as such.

389
00:37:40,195 --> 00:37:43,280
那些粗俗東西不太配的上一個香水製造商
That is a very dirty business and not the work of a perfumer.

390
00:37:43,315 --> 00:37:45,245
小姐?       我沒事 索菲
Miss? I'm all right, Sophie.

391
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:46,975
這塊區域用來加工
This area is dedicated to the production of

392
00:37:46,975 --> 00:37:48,593
拉克曼牌金銀花
Rackham's Honeysuckle.

393
00:37:49,395 --> 00:37:53,360
據説它解除瘙癢有奇效
Relieves itching quite miraculously, I am told.

394
00:37:53,395 --> 00:37:54,880
這個
Here.

395
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:59,280
威廉 這太有意思了
William, this is so amusing.

396
00:37:59,315 --> 00:38:01,165
你眞的這樣想?
Do you really think so?

397
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:02,906
樓梯通往藍色車間
These stairs lead to the blue room,

398
00:38:02,906 --> 00:38:05,122
用來生産
which houses the production of

399
00:38:05,475 --> 00:38:09,005
拉克曼精油 我們的招牌香型
Rackham's Puressence, our signature scent.

400
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:12,638
這裏本來打算做汙水廠的
The factory was originally built to be a sewer works,

401
00:38:12,638 --> 00:38:14,896
很好笑吧
which is ironic.

402
00:38:15,108 --> 00:38:19,840
這是我們的新産品「青春永駐」
Ah, this is one of our new developments, Jeunesse Eternelle.

403
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:23,680
橙色來自於胡蘿蔔
The orange colour comes from carrots.

404
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:30,200
小姐 我想去尿尿
Miss, I need to go piddle.

405
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:34,898
拉克曼先生?
Mr Rackham?

406
00:38:34,898 --> 00:38:39,676
這裏有...洗手間嗎?
Is there on the premises a room with... washing facilities?

407
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:46,640
嗯...有人會帶你去的
Er... someone will show you.

408
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:16,840
求你了 請你幫幫我
Please, please help me.

409
00:40:16,875 --> 00:40:18,245
我去找別人
I'll get someone.

410
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:21,520
不! 只能你幫我
No! You have to help me.

411
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:29,400
求你了
Please.

412
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:48,200
謝謝你
Thank you.

413
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:53,320
我們必須得走
We must go.

414
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,720
走吧
Let's go.

415
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:35,720
離睡覺時間尚早
It's a bit early for bed.

416
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:41,560
我不管 小姐 我累了
I don't mind, miss, I'm tired.

417
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:50,440
我眞感激你 索菲
I'm very grateful to you, Sophie.

418
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:55,160
你救了我
You rescued me.

419
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:16,960
蘇糖小姐 求你別死
Please don't die.

420
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:25,680
我不會死
I won't die.

421
00:42:25,715 --> 00:42:27,680
我保證
I promise.

422
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:32,845
沒事的 小東西
It's all right, little one.

423
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:37,520
什麼也不要擔心 只需相信我
Don't you worry about anything. You just trust me.

424
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:51,840
原諒我姍姍來遲 剛從你的鄰居那裏過來
Forgive the late hour. I was visiting a neighbour of yours.

425
00:42:51,875 --> 00:42:53,360
什麼事?
What is it?

426
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:58,007
上次我來這裏時
There was something I could scarcely

427
00:42:58,007 --> 00:43:00,264
無法忽視的事
fail to notice the last time I was in this house.

428
00:43:00,264 --> 00:43:04,080
這次可能要同你説説了
I should perhaps have spoken to you about it at the time.

429
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:11,880
你讓我過來?
You sent for me?

430
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:16,520
是的
Yes.

431
00:43:18,360 --> 00:43:20,920
不用坐 沒這個必要
Do not sit down, there's no need.

432
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:34,840
聽説你懷上了孩子
It has come to my notice that you are with child.

433
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:38,748
所以你不能留在這裏
It is therefore impossible that you remain

434
00:43:38,748 --> 00:43:40,127
作我女兒的家庭教師了
as my daughter's governess.

435
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:44,525
你的工錢都在裏面
Your wages are enclosed.

436
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:47,871
請你在3月1日之前務必離開
Please be prepared to leave on 1st March.

437
00:43:47,871 --> 00:43:48,899
這裏面有誤會吧
There has been a misunderstanding.

438
00:43:48,899 --> 00:43:52,437
無需再多説了
Further discussion is out of the question.

439
00:43:52,472 --> 00:43:55,880
你不用再來見我了
Do not attempt to come and see me again.

440
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:04,120
謝了
Thank you.

441
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:32,200
「親愛的威廉 原諒我這樣説 你弄錯了」
"Dear William, forgive me saying so, but you are mistaken.

442
00:44:32,235 --> 00:44:35,605
「我之前飽受體內積水的困擾」
"I was briefly afflicted with a painful swelling

443
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:38,640
「現在已經沒有了 我的月事也正常」
"which has since passed and I now have my monthly courses,

444
00:44:38,675 --> 00:44:41,160
「如果你不信 可以自己來檢査」
"as you can discover to your own satisfaction. "

445
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:46,685
「親愛的威廉 求你了」
"Dear William, please,

446
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:51,325
「每個小時等待你的回復 都是一種折磨」
"every hour that I wait for your reply is torture.

447
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:54,470
「記住我全心全意的協助你
"Remember that I am devoted to your assistance

448
00:44:54,470 --> 00:44:56,994
為你分擔煩惱」
and you and sparing you inconvenience... "

449
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:28,570
打擾了 蘇糖小姐
Excuse me, Miss Sugar,

450
00:45:28,570 --> 00:45:31,096
拉克曼先生讓索菲小姐下樓
Mr Rackham has asked if Miss Sophie might be brought down.

451
00:45:31,155 --> 00:45:33,165
我們先整理一下
We shall just tidy ourselves up a bit.

452
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:38,160
蘇糖小姐 他讓我單獨帶索菲小姐下去
Miss Sugar, he asked me to bring Miss Sophie myself.

453
00:45:38,195 --> 00:45:39,680
明白了
I see.

454
00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:44,960
你可以在外面等一下嗎?      當然了 小姐
Could you wait outside a moment? Of course, Miss.

455
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:48,960
來 索菲 站起來
Come on, Sophie, stand up.

456
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:54,040
我想你父親會宣佈一些事情
I think your father has some news for you.

457
00:45:56,080 --> 00:45:59,400
可能會告訴你一些事情
Most probably he is about to tell you something,

458
00:45:59,435 --> 00:46:03,957
我希望你也能告訴他一些事
and I want you to tell him something in return.

459
00:46:03,992 --> 00:46:08,480
你要告訴他你對我的感覺
I want you to tell him how you feel about me.

460
00:46:10,320 --> 00:46:12,240
明白了嗎?
Do you understand?

461
00:46:13,240 --> 00:46:15,445
明白了嗎?
Do you understand?

462
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:18,440
一切都會好起來的
Then everything's going to be all right.

463
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:31,520
她們要把你送走
They're sending you away.

464
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:36,800
你告訴他了嗎?      我告訴他我愛你
But did you tell him? I told him that I love you.

465
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:40,285
他竟然做的出來?
How dare he do this?

466
00:46:40,320 --> 00:46:42,960
他竟然這樣對我的孩子?!
How dare he do this to my child?!

467
00:46:50,600 --> 00:46:53,360
唐思禮小姐
Miss Townsley.

468
00:46:58,920 --> 00:47:00,440
你好 索菲
Hello, Sophie.

469
00:47:03,160 --> 00:47:05,920
我來向你介紹一下唐思禮小姐
I would like to introduce you to Miss Townsley.

470
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:08,960
你好 唐思禮小姐
Hello, Miss Townsley.

471
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:19,200
你會説法語嗎 孩子?
Have you any French, child?

472
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:25,840
法語不是蘇糖小姐的技能
French wasn't one of Miss Sugar's accomplishments.

473
00:47:27,360 --> 00:47:29,565
那鋼琴呢?
What about the piano?

474
00:47:29,600 --> 00:47:32,640
也是 恐怕是蘇糖小姐不太稱職
Again, I'm afraid Miss Sugar came up rather short.

475
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:40,502
蘇糖小姐要立即離開
I think it best Miss Sugar leave immediately

476
00:47:40,502 --> 00:47:43,171
免得帶給索菲更多困擾
to prevent further distress to Sophie.

477
00:47:43,171 --> 00:47:46,020
鑑於你説她已經産生了很強的依戀感
If as you say she has formed a very strong attachment,

478
00:47:46,020 --> 00:47:48,921
可能這樣最好
I think that might be preferable.

479
00:47:47,955 --> 00:47:50,777
可你的家庭教師有地方去嗎?
But does your governess have somewhere to go?

480
00:47:50,812 --> 00:47:53,600
當然 她隨時可以回家去找她媽
Oh, yes. She can always go home to her mother.

481
00:48:32,560 --> 00:48:34,605
蘇糖小姐!
Miss Sugar!

482
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:38,360
今天我們可能要外出探險 索菲
I thought we might go for an adventure outside today, Sophie.

483
00:48:38,395 --> 00:48:41,097
這裏太悶了      是的 小姐
It's so stuffy in here. Yes, miss.

484
00:48:41,132 --> 00:48:43,800
別忘了你的圍脖      好的
Don't forget your muffler. Yes.

485
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:50,800
你的觀察鏡呢?
What about your spy glass?

486
00:48:58,040 --> 00:49:01,080
天啊 小姐 我們帶上好多故事一起上路
Goodness, Miss, we are taking a lot of stories with us.

487
00:49:01,115 --> 00:49:03,960
我們將進行一場偉大的冒險 索菲
We are going on a great expedition, Sophie,

488
00:49:03,995 --> 00:49:06,240
誰知道會需要些什麼呢?
who knows what provisions we may need?

489
00:49:09,240 --> 00:49:11,040
明天是美國嗎?
Is it America tomorrow?

490
00:49:13,320 --> 00:49:15,840
明天是美國
America tomorrow.

491
00:49:31,480 --> 00:49:33,000
拿着很重的包啊 小姐
Heavy bags you got there, Miss.

492
00:49:33,035 --> 00:49:35,565
要遠行嗎?
Goin' far with them?

493
00:49:35,600 --> 00:49:37,565
不得無禮 契斯曼
You're impertinent, Cheesman.

494
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:42,680
我回來的時候會告訴拉克曼先生?      你回來?
I shall speak to Mr Rackham about you on our return. Your return?

495
00:49:42,715 --> 00:49:44,720
那是什麼時候?
That be soon then?

496
00:49:49,360 --> 00:49:51,405
我們單獨談談
I shall speak to you in private.

497
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:54,840
索菲?  是的小姐  我一會就過來 好的 小姐
Sophie? Yes, Miss. I shall be back in a moment. Yes, Miss.

498
00:50:00,440 --> 00:50:02,765
給你十鎊 契斯曼
Ten pounds, Cheesman.

499
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:05,445
大手筆呀     對你是一小筆橫財了
Aren't we grand! A small fortune for you.

500
00:50:05,480 --> 00:50:08,264
拉克曼夫人遇難後
I wondered after Mrs Rackham met her doom

501
00:50:08,264 --> 00:50:10,235
我以為你要取代她了
if you weren't hoping to take her place.

502
00:50:13,560 --> 00:50:17,320
拿上錢 放我們走
Take the money, and let us be on our way.

503
00:50:17,355 --> 00:50:18,840
我看到了她
I saw her.

504
00:50:20,360 --> 00:50:22,200
從河裏拖上來
Dragged from the river.

505
00:50:25,800 --> 00:50:28,040
一切都難以辨認了
There was nothing left to recognise.

506
00:50:29,560 --> 00:50:31,640
除了她的頭髮
Except her hair.

507
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:35,760
長長的金髮
Those long blonde locks.

508
00:50:37,720 --> 00:50:39,520
被汙水浸泡 纏繞着水草
Full of weed and dirty water.

509
00:50:43,120 --> 00:50:45,280
你認為金錢如此美好 小姐
You see money's all well and good, Miss.

510
00:50:47,560 --> 00:50:50,240
但我更想要點私人的東西
But what I'd like is something a little more personal.

511
00:51:00,440 --> 00:51:02,800
我想試試他嚐過的
I want a taste of what he's had.

512
00:51:13,560 --> 00:51:15,680
婊子
Bitch!

513
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,040
我們去哪裏 小姐?      美好的地方
Where are we going, Miss? Somewhere nice.

514
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:40,965
要我拿個包嗎 小姐?
Shall I carry a bag, Miss?

515
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,100
對你來説太重了 索菲!
They're too heavy for you, Sophie.

516
00:51:43,135 --> 00:51:45,165
我們去坐公共馬車
Let's take a ride on the omnibus.

517
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:47,920
你跑上前去告訴他我們要坐
Run ahead so the conductor can see we want to get on.

518
00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:40,280
我們現在要去哪裏 小姐?
Where are we going now, Miss?

519
00:52:40,315 --> 00:52:43,040
非常有趣的地方
Somewhere very interesting.

520
00:52:43,075 --> 00:52:44,560
我保證
I promise.

521
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:01,085
「讀者啊 你如此自大」
'How smug you are, reader,

522
00:53:01,120 --> 00:53:03,194
「也許你的性別讓你
'if you are a member of that sex

523
00:53:03,194 --> 00:53:05,956
以褲襠裏的那根軟骨為傲」
that boasts a scrag of gristle in your trousers.

524
00:53:05,956 --> 00:53:10,707
「你想讓這本書吸引你 刺激你
'You fancy this book will amuse you, thrill you,

525
00:53:10,707 --> 00:53:13,145
從無聊的恐怖中拯救你」
rescue you from the horror of boredom.

526
00:53:13,145 --> 00:53:14,779
「而你讀完它
'And that, having consumed it,

527
00:53:14,779 --> 00:53:18,438
還可以迴歸現實」
you will be left at liberty to resume your life as before.

528
00:53:18,835 --> 00:53:21,725
「可這本書不同
'But this book is different.

529
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:25,720
這本書是把利刃 腦袋放機靈點
'This book is a knife. Keep your wits about you.

530
00:53:25,755 --> 00:53:27,720
這是為你好」
'You will need them!'

531
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:31,200
有人嗎?
Hello?

532
00:53:35,240 --> 00:53:37,365
開門!
Open the door!

533
00:53:37,400 --> 00:53:38,869
我開不開門
Whether I open the door or not

534
00:53:38,869 --> 00:53:42,107
要看你有多壞囉 你夠壞嗎?
depends on how bad a boy you've been. Have you been very bad?

535
00:53:42,107 --> 00:53:44,440
我找卡特韋夫人
I want to speak to Mrs C-Castaway!

536
00:53:49,880 --> 00:53:52,045
她死了很久了
She's long dead.

537
00:53:52,080 --> 00:53:54,805
我找的是蘇糖
It's Sugar I'm after.

538
00:53:54,840 --> 00:53:57,720
我必須要找到她
It is imperative that I f-find her.

539
00:53:59,880 --> 00:54:02,420
付多少都行!     請你小聲一點 先生!
I'll pay whatever you ask! Please lower your voice, Sir!

540
00:54:02,455 --> 00:54:04,925
首先 你要找的蘇糖已經放棄了風流生涯
Firstly, the girl you call Sugar has renounced the gay life.

541
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:06,174
第二  香皂和護膚膏上
Secondly, your soaps and ointments

542
00:54:06,174 --> 00:54:08,133
印上你的形象毫無幫助
are not improved by having your image on them.

543
00:54:08,133 --> 00:54:09,278
上帝 給個地方讓我們
