1
00:00:00,543 --> 00:00:03,256
這是本仇恨的書 用來報復每個外強中乾的
It's a book of hate, to wreak revenge on every pompous

2
00:00:03,257 --> 00:00:05,805
爬上卡特韋夫人門檻的小爬蟲
trembling worm who taps at Mrs Castaway's door.

3
00:00:05,806 --> 00:00:08,431
你是...?      蘇糖就是我的姓名
And you are?        Sugar is all there is to my name.

4
00:00:08,432 --> 00:00:11,312
就算會被折磨死 我也要治好病
I am going to get well. Even if it kills me.

5
00:00:11,313 --> 00:00:15,195
人生得一知己 一世難求啊
Kindred spirits like yourself are difficult to find.

6
00:00:15,196 --> 00:00:17,591
我對蘇糖的專屬佔有權
Exclusive patronage of Sugar by me.

7
00:00:17,592 --> 00:00:18,494
我願意
I am willing.

8
00:00:18,794 --> 00:00:21,184
你的人生從今以後就不同了
Your life is going to be very different from now on.

9
00:00:21,185 --> 00:00:22,854
我不是瘋女人
I am not a mad woman!

10
00:00:22,855 --> 00:00:25,226
我預料她很快就會崩潰
I expect a full collapse very shortly.

11
00:00:26,676 --> 00:00:31,252
我的上帝 威廉·拉克漢 你得對我更好點了
My God, William Rackham. You'll keep me better than you do now!

12
00:00:31,253 --> 00:00:32,401
我的天使
My angel...

13
00:00:33,451 --> 00:00:34,868
終於來了
..come at last.

可我也有我的夢
But I have my dreams also.

00:01:10,157 --> 00:01:14,428
夢想着報復每一個奪走我純眞的男人
Dreams of revenge against the men who took my innocence.

21
00:01:14,429 --> 00:01:17,395
(本片含有部分粗口)
This programme contains some strong language

22
00:01:17,395 --> 00:01:20,332
(以及性場面)
and scenes of a sexual nature.

23
00:01:28,115 --> 00:01:30,010
你知道嗎 我好多年
You know, it's been years

24
00:01:30,469 --> 00:01:32,661
沒在一個女人身邊過一整夜了
since I've slept beside a woman all night.

25
00:01:35,773 --> 00:01:39,643
我得起了 還得回家看看
But I must get up. I have to look in at home.

26
00:01:40,901 --> 00:01:43,019
你肩上的擔子可眞重
You have so many responsibilities.

27
00:01:49,168 --> 00:01:51,530
對了 信函照我們討論的改了嗎?
Oh, did you make those changes we discussed to the letter?

28
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:52,984
該死的黃麻商人
Damn jute merchants.

29
00:01:52,985 --> 00:01:55,344
又不敢惹他們翻臉      都改好了
Can't afford to fall out with them.        All done.

30
00:01:59,008 --> 00:02:00,532
這是什麼臭味?
What is that terrible smell?

31
00:02:01,662 --> 00:02:03,606
現在我的鼻子可靈敏了
My nose is very sensitive at the moment.

32
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:06,726
如果連德爾斐熏衣草
If it can distinguish between Lavandula delphinensis

33
00:02:06,727 --> 00:02:09,501
和寬葉熏衣草都能區分 那當然也能聞出
and Lavandula latifolia then it can certainly detect...

34
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:12,290
是狗屎
Uh! Dog's mess.

35
00:02:14,087 --> 00:02:15,242
哦 威廉 眞對不起
Oh, William, I'm sorry.

36
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:17,802
聖基爾斯這裏髒亂不堪
St Giles is filthy.

37
00:02:20,327 --> 00:02:22,281
我們能有別的地方相會就好了
I do wish there was somewhere else we could meet.

38
00:02:24,018 --> 00:02:26,248
我眞不願意把你拖到這個瘟疫窩來
I hate dragging you to this plague pit.

39
00:02:33,858 --> 00:02:35,255
眞的 有時我覺得要是
You know, I sometimes think it would be a miracle

40
00:02:35,256 --> 00:02:38,270
我25歳還沒染上霍亂就是奇蹟了
if I'm not carried off by the cholera by the time I'm 25!

41
00:02:39,697 --> 00:02:40,831
別説了
Don't say that!

42
00:02:42,324 --> 00:02:46,232
得了 只不過是萍水之交的女人 然後呢
Really, one forms the slightest attachment to a woman, then...

43
00:02:47,657 --> 00:02:48,527
信給我
The letter.

44
00:02:53,397 --> 00:02:55,431
威廉 對不起 我是開玩笑的
William, forgive me, I was joking.

45
00:02:55,621 --> 00:02:56,966
還是別開的好
Well, I wish you wouldn't.

46
00:03:18,435 --> 00:03:21,912
天啊 拉克曼太太 您可眞忙活
Goodness, Mrs Rackham. You have been busy.

47
00:03:22,339 --> 00:03:23,941
你知道這些是什麼嗎 克拉拉?
Do you know what this is, Clara?

48
00:03:26,274 --> 00:03:27,456
請柬?
invitations?

49
00:03:29,226 --> 00:03:30,435
這是諒解
It's forgiveness.

50
00:03:32,171 --> 00:03:34,551
社會對我敞開大門了
Society opening its doors.

51
00:03:34,552 --> 00:03:36,738
我也要參加社交季了
I am to be included in the Season.

52
00:03:37,288 --> 00:03:39,242
布利德樓夫人都發來了 你看
Even Lady Bridgelow, see?

53
00:03:39,243 --> 00:03:43,326
安菲特太太還請我下週去用茶
And Mrs Amphlett has invited me to tea next week.

54
00:03:44,613 --> 00:03:46,560
世界要變了 克拉拉
A great change is in the air, Clara!

55
00:03:48,366 --> 00:03:50,095
一切都會好起來的
Everything is going to be all right!

56
00:03:57,209 --> 00:03:59,105
福克斯太太      亨利
Mrs Fox.        Henry.

57
00:03:59,425 --> 00:04:01,914
希望我沒打攪到您
I hope I do not inconvenience you.

58
00:04:01,915 --> 00:04:03,752
説哪裏話 請原諒這麼亂
Not in the least. Forgive all this,

59
00:04:03,753 --> 00:04:06,667
我家被救濟社當成倉庫了
I've become the Rescue Society's unofficial warehouse.

60
00:04:17,865 --> 00:04:18,720
哦 抱歉
Oh, excuse me.

61
00:04:19,703 --> 00:04:22,185
這就是你今天沒看見我去教堂的原因
This is why you did not see me at church today.

62
00:04:25,505 --> 00:04:28,179
恕我冒昧 你的女傭在哪?
Forgive me, where is your maid?

63
00:04:28,542 --> 00:04:31,481
我週末讓她放假回家 照顧她祖父去了
I let her go home on the weekends to care for her grandfather.

64
00:04:32,325 --> 00:04:34,887
這麼説 家裏就你和我
So, we are alone in the house?

65
00:04:35,535 --> 00:04:38,728
這樣...合適嗎?
Is that...quite decent?

66
00:04:47,295 --> 00:04:50,350
恐怕可可對我刺激非常大
I'm afraid I find cocoa terrifically stimulating.

67
00:04:53,405 --> 00:04:55,460
我們太容易受誘惑了
We are so easily seduced.

68
00:04:57,368 --> 00:04:58,201
是嗎?
Are we?

69
00:04:58,676 --> 00:05:01,358
就在上週 我回家途中
Just last week, I was on my way home

70
00:05:01,359 --> 00:05:03,463
剛拜訪完一個非常悽慘的家庭
from visiting a particularly wretched family.

71
00:05:03,464 --> 00:05:06,631
我又疲憊 又沮喪 連路也懶得走了
I was tired, discouraged, and I didn't want to walk.

72
00:05:07,363 --> 00:05:08,694
恍惚之間
And before I knew what I was doing,

73
00:05:08,695 --> 00:05:12,010
我就進了地下鐵道 在大地中飛速穿行
I was in the underground railway, speeding through the earth,

74
00:05:13,083 --> 00:05:16,179
滿心只想着自己的愉悅
mindless of anything except my own pleasure.

75
00:05:18,753 --> 00:05:20,798
這一切只要一枚六便士
And all at the cost of a sixpence.

76
00:05:21,852 --> 00:05:22,841
天啊
Goodness.

77
00:05:24,332 --> 00:05:27,449
我沈醉其間 甚至坐過了站
I enjoyed it so much, I missed my stop.

78
00:05:32,873 --> 00:05:35,164
世界會這麼毀了的 亨利
This is how the world will end, Henry.

79
00:05:36,561 --> 00:05:39,241
基督之敵就是我們的慾望
The Antichrist is our own desires.

80
00:05:58,998 --> 00:06:00,824
你起得眞早
You are the early bird.

81
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:05,670
我要出門辦點事
I have some errands to run.

82
00:06:06,606 --> 00:06:08,581
好吧 反正你閒得很
Well, you've time on your hands.

83
00:06:09,971 --> 00:06:12,841
亨特先生好久沒來了 對吧?
We haven't seen much of Mr Hunt lately, have we?

84
00:06:13,968 --> 00:06:16,114
多久了 一個星期?
What is it? A week now?

85
00:06:17,054 --> 00:06:18,684
亨特先生很忙
Mr Hunt is a busy man.

86
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,117
看來是這樣
Oh, so it seems.

87
00:06:24,214 --> 00:06:28,687
不過忙些什麼 我就搞不清了
Although with what exactly, I'm never certain.

88
00:06:30,374 --> 00:06:33,173
等他下次來 你問問他啊
Well, you can ask him, next time he comes.

89
00:06:33,174 --> 00:06:36,588
分手的時候別吃虧就行 記住了?
Just so long as you parted from him on good terms, hmm?

90
00:06:39,629 --> 00:06:40,782
還照老辦法
As always.

91
00:06:41,746 --> 00:06:43,319
不過我們怕什麼?
But what do we care?

92
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:47,053
我知道爐邊客棧的人可想你了
I know you're much missed at the Fireside.

93
00:06:50,761 --> 00:06:54,533
還記得你小時候 我們玩的那個遊戲嗎?
Do you remember the game we used to play when you were a baby?

94
00:06:56,772 --> 00:06:59,033
在最寒冷的冬夜
On the coldest winter nights,

95
00:06:59,885 --> 00:07:03,156
我溜進你房間 你睡得正熟
I'd creep in to your room while you were sleeping,

96
00:07:03,842 --> 00:07:07,288
緊緊裹着毯子 我就...
all cuddled up in your blanket, and I'd...

97
00:07:07,827 --> 00:07:08,959
把它掀掉
pull it off!

98
00:07:10,866 --> 00:07:12,246
你記得嗎?
Do you remember?

99
00:07:13,482 --> 00:07:15,217
我就把它掀掉
I'd pull it off

100
00:07:15,593 --> 00:07:16,706
然後説
and I'd say,

101
00:07:17,654 --> 00:07:19,293
「上帝就愛這麼做!」
"That's what God does!"

102
00:07:22,737 --> 00:07:25,994
上帝就愛這麼做
That's what God does.

103
00:08:10,930 --> 00:08:11,745
早安
Morning.

104
00:08:18,797 --> 00:08:19,589
早安
Morning.

105
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:27,427
刀尖抵上了柔軟的皮肉 我卻猶豫起來
'The dagger tip touched tender flesh and yet I hesitated.

106
00:08:30,548 --> 00:08:32,890
他不是所有男人中最壞的一個嗎?
'Was not this man worse than all the rest?

107
00:08:33,752 --> 00:08:35,475
他不是背叛了我的信任
'Had he not abused my trust

108
00:08:35,476 --> 00:08:38,017
把我扔回汙穢之中了嗎?
and cast me back into the pit of filth?

109
00:08:38,471 --> 00:08:40,334
可我還是挿不下去
'Yet I could not thrust it home.

110
00:08:43,955 --> 00:08:46,233
我收起我忠實的匕首
'I put away my trusty blade,

111
00:08:46,234 --> 00:08:49,089
取來毒藥和最柔軟的布
fetched poison and the softest cloth.'

112
00:08:55,963 --> 00:08:57,719
做個好夢 我的愛人
Sweet dreams, my love.

113
00:09:07,324 --> 00:09:10,503
拉克漢太太 你的祕方是什麼?
Mrs Rackham, what is your secret?

114
00:09:10,504 --> 00:09:13,306
我的祕方?      新的蒸氣浴療法嗎?
My secret?        Some new spa, perhaps?

115
00:09:13,743 --> 00:09:15,468
你氣色簡直太好了
You're looking most terribly well.

116
00:09:16,883 --> 00:09:19,430
哦 沒有 沒有 安菲特太太
Oh, no, no, no, Mrs Amphlett.

117
00:09:20,508 --> 00:09:22,083
我正在想 你的樣子
Well, I was just thinking that you look

118
00:09:22,084 --> 00:09:24,928
也比上次見面改善了很多呢
quite remarkably different from the last time I saw you.

119
00:09:25,919 --> 00:09:28,647
這麼瘦 我都認不出你了
So thin! I hardly recognised you.

120
00:09:28,648 --> 00:09:31,673
承蒙誇獎      哪裏呀 我都嫉妒了
You are very kind.        Not at all, I'm envious.

121
00:09:31,674 --> 00:09:34,488
我遵守嚴格而簡單的養生食譜
I swear by a strict but simple regime of

122
00:09:34,489 --> 00:09:35,887
只有清水和青豆
water and green beans,

123
00:09:35,888 --> 00:09:38,780
如果頭暈 再加一口牛尾湯
and if I am feeling dizzy, a mouthful of oxtail soup.

124
00:09:38,781 --> 00:09:41,125
不過湯必須非常剋制
But the soup must be very well strained.

125
00:09:42,456 --> 00:09:45,004
我得記住 不 我得抄下來
I shall remember. No, I shall write this down.

126
00:09:45,437 --> 00:09:46,790
我得提醒你 一開始
I should caution you that at first

127
00:09:46,791 --> 00:09:49,031
你可能感到頭痛 虛弱
you may experience debilitating headaches.

128
00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:51,425
我已經飽受頭痛折磨了
I am already a martyr to headaches!

129
00:09:51,426 --> 00:09:55,982
我們一邊談話 我就一邊感到可怕的抽痛
As we speak, I'm prey to a terrible throbbing.

130
00:09:58,455 --> 00:10:00,866
其實你不必這樣受苦
But there is no need for you to suffer as you do.

131
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:09,000
瞧這個...
Here, look...

132
00:10:09,986 --> 00:10:12,758
不舒服時 我就吃上兩片...
On bad days, I take a couple of these...

133
00:10:14,219 --> 00:10:15,971
加一劑高弗雷鎭靜劑 (常用藥 主料爲鴉片)
..with a dose of Godfrey's Cordial.

134
00:10:15,972 --> 00:10:17,486
找你的藥劑師要
Ask your pharmacist.

135
00:10:19,098 --> 00:10:21,963
醫生知道了會對你長篇大論...
Your doctor would give you a lecture on them...

136
00:10:23,256 --> 00:10:24,785
可是相信我
but trust me -

137
00:10:25,714 --> 00:10:28,057
你會連自己都不認得的
you will hardly know yourself.

138
00:11:07,885 --> 00:11:09,257
這樣可眞愜意
Well, this is pleasant.

139
00:11:10,221 --> 00:11:11,369
一起用餐
A meal together.

140
00:11:13,533 --> 00:11:15,374
你提議我們一起用餐的
You suggested we have a meal together.

141
00:11:19,161 --> 00:11:20,369
對 是我提的

144

不 你剛剛在微笑
No, you were just smiling.

145
00:11:42,932 --> 00:11:44,782
哦 威廉...
Well, William...

146
00:11:46,430 --> 00:11:47,618
其實是因爲...
..the fact is...

147
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:52,083
我有個守護天使
..I have a guardian angel.

148
00:11:55,105 --> 00:11:56,484
你是説克拉拉?
Are you referring to Clara?

149
00:11:57,066 --> 00:11:59,691
不 一個眞正的守護天使
No, a real guardian angel.

150
00:12:00,903 --> 00:12:02,340
她守望着我們
She watches over us.

151
00:12:03,265 --> 00:12:05,832
我時時刻刻都感到她在身邊
I feel her about me all the time.

152
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:09,550
我覺得她是從健康修院來的
I think she's from the Convent of Health,

153
00:12:09,551 --> 00:12:11,801
就是我睡着了會去的那個地方
you know, the place I go when I'm asleep.

154
00:12:11,802 --> 00:12:13,988
我沒發現你出去啊 親愛的
I wasn't aware you were going anywhere, dear,

155
00:12:14,642 --> 00:12:15,647
你睡得好好的
when you were sleeping.

156
00:12:15,648 --> 00:12:18,579
那裏的修女都是眞正的天使
The nuns there are really angels.

157
00:12:20,007 --> 00:12:22,067
我很久前就在懷疑了
I suspected that for a long time.

158
00:12:22,068 --> 00:12:24,790
好在現在有證據了
But what a relief to have proof!

159
00:12:26,315 --> 00:12:27,242
證據?
Proof?

160
00:12:28,985 --> 00:12:31,283
對 我朝她揮手 她也朝我揮手
Yeah, I waved to her and she waved back.

161
00:12:39,825 --> 00:12:40,966
你不餓嗎?
Are you not hungry?

162
00:13:00,329 --> 00:13:01,254
他來了
He's here!

163
00:13:02,753 --> 00:13:04,186
快去叫他上來啊
Well, go on, send him up.

164
00:13:06,339 --> 00:13:07,705
他要你下去
He wants you to come down.

165
00:13:09,399 --> 00:13:10,915
他在跟卡特韋説話
He's talking to Castaway.

166
00:13:20,366 --> 00:13:21,238
蘇糖
Sugar.

167
00:13:23,526 --> 00:13:28,832
恐怕亨特先生受夠我們的房子了
I'm afraid to say, Mr Hunt has had enough of our house.

168
00:13:32,135 --> 00:13:34,075
我太遺憾了 亨特先生
I'm sorry to hear that, Mr Hunt.

169
00:13:35,389 --> 00:13:39,712
看來亨特先生對你另有安排
It seems Mr Hunt has other plans for you.

170
00:13:51,475 --> 00:13:53,152
我一直在想你
I have missed your company.

171
00:13:53,521 --> 00:13:55,096
離開你我也很難受
It's been difficult getting away.

172
00:13:57,991 --> 00:14:00,132
艾格尼絲開始産生幻覺了
Agnes is seeing things.

173
00:14:01,846 --> 00:14:03,051
幻覺?
Seeing things?

174
00:14:04,952 --> 00:14:06,301
在街上看見天使
Angels in the street.

175
00:14:49,965 --> 00:14:51,079
還有誰在?
Who else is here?

176
00:15:18,186 --> 00:15:19,331
這是什麼?
What is this?

177
00:15:19,771 --> 00:15:21,664
這是你的
This is yours.

178
00:15:23,534 --> 00:15:24,528
也是我的
And mine.

179
00:15:25,710 --> 00:15:28,077
我再也不能忍受你住在
I couldn't bear the thought of you living in that

180
00:15:28,078 --> 00:15:29,986
那個汙穢的貧民窟了
filthy part of town any longer.

181
00:15:32,165 --> 00:15:34,859
銀行會寄給你生活費
The bank will send you an allowance.

182
00:15:36,505 --> 00:15:37,793
這是第一筆
First payment is here.

183
00:15:39,947 --> 00:15:41,688
你完全獨立了
You will be independent.

184
00:15:49,748 --> 00:15:51,735
説句話啊      哦 上帝
Say something!        Oh, dear God!

185
00:16:19,928 --> 00:16:21,444
想你的鏡子了嗎?
Will you miss your looking glass?

186
00:16:24,158 --> 00:16:27,119
我還看自己做什麼 不是有你看着我了嗎?
Why do I need to look at myself when I have you to look at me?

187
00:16:28,851 --> 00:16:31,500
我吩咐了卡特韋夫人 你房裏的東西都別動
I've instructed Mrs Castaway that nothing in your room be touched

188
00:16:31,501 --> 00:16:32,887
等你去取
until you remove it.

189
00:16:34,690 --> 00:16:36,555
我離開她傷心了嗎?
Did she seem sorry to see me go?

190
00:16:37,132 --> 00:16:38,233
一點都沒有
Not in the least!

191
00:16:39,012 --> 00:16:41,248
那老錢婆纔不會放過一筆好交易呢
The old trout knows a good deal when she sees one.

192
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:48,146
不過你不用再管她了
But you need not worry about her any more,

193
00:16:50,015 --> 00:16:51,660
也不用管從前的人了
nor anyone from your past.

194
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:53,827
你有了新的人生
You have a new life,

195
00:16:54,261 --> 00:16:55,417
在這裏 和我一起
here with me.

196
00:17:13,097 --> 00:17:14,543
你的書全都拿走啦?
Taken all your books, I see?

197
00:17:18,535 --> 00:17:19,856
別忘了那個盆
Don't forget your bowl.

198
00:17:20,350 --> 00:17:24,211
不錯的盆呢      我不需要了
Good bowl, that.        Well, I won't need it.

199
00:17:24,777 --> 00:17:26,450
新家有個浴缸
There's a bath at the new place.

200
00:17:27,411 --> 00:17:29,129
你的牀單誰洗呢?
Who'll take care of your sheets?

201
00:17:30,982 --> 00:17:32,392
我自己洗唄
I will, I suppose.

202
00:17:37,885 --> 00:17:39,437
那我可少了一件活了
That's me out of a job then.

203
00:17:43,839 --> 00:17:46,332
告訴你 我覺得 克里斯托弗...
You know, I was thinking, Christopher, that...

204
00:17:47,963 --> 00:17:51,531
我可以偶爾回來 和你一起唸書
I could come back sometimes and you and I could read together.

205
00:18:01,399 --> 00:18:02,950
我會回來找你的
I will come back for you.

206
00:18:18,926 --> 00:18:20,345
你要離開我們啦
You're leaving us then.

207
00:18:21,117 --> 00:18:22,940
過了這麼多年
After all these years.

208
00:18:24,183 --> 00:18:26,935
老天知道 當年爲了擺脱你我費了多大勁
Lord knows I tried hard enough to be rid of you once.

209
00:18:27,939 --> 00:18:31,217
什麼毒藥沒往身上招呼過
No brew so toxic I didn't inflict it upon myself,

210
00:18:31,218 --> 00:18:35,317
多燙的洗澡水沒泡過
no bath so scalding I didn't immerse myself in it.

211
00:18:36,499 --> 00:18:39,275
你就是死不了
You were indestructible!

212
00:18:40,217 --> 00:18:41,743
希望我將來還這樣吧
Let's hope I remain so.

215
00:18:57,868 --> 00:19:00,062
有位先生給我取暖來了
there was a gentleman come to keep me warm.

216
00:19:05,486 --> 00:19:09,024

不耽誤你了
Nothing to hold you here.

She's been marvellous really, considering how she has suffered.

00:26:21,961 --> 00:26:24,115
我也參與他的生意
I'm involved with his business.

273
00:26:24,116 --> 00:26:25,958
莫名地讓人滿意
It's oddly satisfying.

274
00:26:30,118 --> 00:26:31,753
你還有時間寫書嗎?
You still got time for your book?

275
00:26:37,336 --> 00:26:38,841
沒我想象的多
Not as much as I'd hoped.

276
00:26:40,728 --> 00:26:42,539
也許比平常還少了?
Perhaps got less to avenge now?

277
00:26:44,892 --> 00:26:46,076
不 那倒沒有
No, I don't think that.

278
00:26:47,575 --> 00:26:48,488
完全沒有
Not at all.

279
00:26:50,909 --> 00:26:52,859
心軟了沒什麼不好 蘇糖
No harm in getting soft, Sugar.

280
00:26:54,203 --> 00:26:56,595
我們都會的 只要有一點點機會
We all would, given half a chance.

281
00:27:12,471 --> 00:27:14,511
酒鬼 喝呀
Rackers, buck up!

282
00:27:14,761 --> 00:27:16,237
你看樣子更想大吃一頓
You look as though you'd rather be tucked up.

283
00:27:16,238 --> 00:27:18,370
我凌晨四點纔從丹地回來
I got back from Dundee at four this morning!

284
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:21,768
弗拉泰里的歌聲會給你提神的
Flatelli will soon put the wind in your sails.

285
00:27:22,377 --> 00:27:25,263
一會我們有計劃...讓你散心 別着急
We have plans to, er, revive you later, don't worry.

286
00:27:25,703 --> 00:27:27,305
我們今早去了卡特韋太太那
We called on Mrs Castaway this morning.

287
00:27:27,306 --> 00:27:30,484
有位幸運的先生把傳説中的蘇糖買走了
Some lucky gent has taken the legendary Sugar off the market -

288
00:27:30,485 --> 00:27:32,801
我們還沒享受到她的魅力呢
before we'd had the benefit of her charms.

289
00:27:32,802 --> 00:27:34,320
如果你眞找到包她的人
If you find out who's got her,

290
00:27:34,321 --> 00:27:36,133
千萬告訴他我們很想分一杯羹
do tell him we're dying to have a bash.

291
00:27:38,079 --> 00:27:40,396
我們打算去特魯里街看看雙胞胎
Anyway, we thought a trip to the twins in Drury Lane.

292
00:27:41,291 --> 00:27:42,588
我約了人 不去了
previous engagement.

293
00:27:43,427 --> 00:27:45,059
你眞無聊 比爾
You are dull, Bill.

294

我很開心呀
But happy.

295

他瘋掉了
He's lost his mind.

296
00:27:52,025 --> 00:27:54,175
你不是喝熏衣草香水了吧?
You haven't been drinking the lavender water?

297
00:28:03,021 --> 00:28:04,801
不是每個人都能穿白的
Not everyone can wear white.

298
00:28:04,802 --> 00:28:07,213
確實不是 拉克漢太太
No, indeed, Mrs Rackham.

299
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:09,952
必須夠瘦纔行
You have to be very thin.

300
00:28:31,374 --> 00:28:33,402
你説她到底吃不吃飯的?
Do you think she ever eats?

301
00:28:38,723 --> 00:28:39,587
走吧?
Shall we?

你覺得怎樣 艾格尼絲?
Your opinion, Agnes?

304
00:29:53,041 --> 00:29:55,932
我沒感覺 我就想透透氣
I have no opinion. I'd merely like some air.

305
00:29:55,933 --> 00:29:57,334
天啊 你眞憔悴
Oh, goodness, you do look peakish.

306
00:30:00,284 --> 00:30:01,464
布利德樓夫人
Lady Bridgelow,

307
00:30:01,627 --> 00:30:05,604
你對我的關心眞是僞善又噁心
your concern for me is false and poisonous.

308
00:30:05,856 --> 00:30:09,669
你又肥又胖 下巴上還長毛
You are fat and your chin has hairs on it!

309
00:30:30,682 --> 00:30:31,610
艾格尼絲?
Agnes?

310
00:30:36,119 --> 00:30:37,057
艾格尼絲?
Agnes?

311
00:30:47,755 --> 00:30:48,639
艾格尼絲?
Agnes?

312
00:30:55,034 --> 00:30:55,919
克拉拉?
Clara?

313
00:30:58,075 --> 00:30:59,681
你不能看我的臉
You must not look at me in the face.

314
00:31:00,587 --> 00:31:01,939
你不該看見我
You're not supposed to see me.

315
00:31:04,050 --> 00:31:05,131
眞的是你嗎?
Is it you?

316
00:31:06,218 --> 00:31:07,957
我是來幫你的 艾格尼絲
I'm going to help you, Agnes,

317
00:31:08,449 --> 00:31:10,879
可你不能看我的臉
but you must not look at my face.

318
00:31:14,875 --> 00:31:17,883
威廉總説你是我的想象
William says you are a trick of my imagination.

319
00:31:28,113 --> 00:31:29,303
我好髒
I am filthy.

320
00:31:32,017 --> 00:31:33,890
我全髒了
I'm covered in filth.

321
00:31:34,375 --> 00:31:36,086
站起來 站起來
Stand up, stand up.

322
00:31:40,427 --> 00:31:41,678
圍上這個
Wrap this round you.

323
00:31:44,347 --> 00:31:46,396
你的味道好熟悉
You smell familiar.

324
00:31:50,563 --> 00:31:51,472
現在聽好
Now listen,

325
00:31:53,046 --> 00:31:56,635
我要你從這走出去 向左轉
I need you to walk out of here and turn left.

326
00:31:59,138 --> 00:32:03,635
我會守望着你 艾格尼絲 可我們必須保密
I'll be watching you, Agnes, but this must be our secret.

327
00:32:04,727 --> 00:32:07,100
你明白嗎? 不然我會有麻煩的
Do you understand? Otherwise I could get into trouble.

328
00:32:08,717 --> 00:32:10,866
天使也會有麻煩嗎?
Can angels get into trouble?

329
00:32:12,679 --> 00:32:15,593
我們這種生物不該介入你們的世界
Creatures like us are not supposed to interfere in your world.

330
00:32:23,201 --> 00:32:25,053
我在守望着你 記住
I'm watching you, remember.

331
00:32:31,185 --> 00:32:32,677
走吧 不要停
Go on, keep moving.

332
00:33:28,124 --> 00:33:31,057
眞想知道這麼晚你能去哪
I do wonder where you can be at this time of night.

333
00:33:40,526 --> 00:33:41,458
克拉拉
Clara!

334
00:33:42,882 --> 00:33:45,023
是我 威廉
It's me, William.

335
00:33:47,236 --> 00:33:48,383
克拉拉呢?
Where's Clara?

336
00:33:51,646 --> 00:33:53,909
就在外面 別怕
Just outside, don't worry.

337
00:33:56,538 --> 00:33:58,217
你感覺怎樣 親愛的?
How do you feel now, dear?

338
00:34:01,776 --> 00:34:03,420
像頂無主的帽子
Like a lost bonnet

339
00:34:04,158 --> 00:34:06,897
順着一條暗河漂流
floating along a dark river.

340
00:34:14,689 --> 00:34:16,649
你眞體諒人
You are so very understanding.

341
00:34:16,650 --> 00:34:17,512
不 不
No, no.

342
00:34:18,806 --> 00:34:19,931
我憐憫她
I pity her.

343
00:34:21,113 --> 00:34:23,034
我們這些健康無恙的人
We who have uninterrupted health

344
00:34:23,035 --> 00:34:25,170
要爲我們的好運感恩
must be thankful for our good fortune.

345
00:34:25,653 --> 00:34:28,621
難怪我親愛的阿爾伯特總告訴我要感恩
Certainly my dear Albert always urged me to be thankful for it

346
00:34:28,622 --> 00:34:29,843
當年他活着的時候
when he was alive.

347
00:34:29,878 --> 00:34:32,136
哦 親愛的布利德樓夫人
Oh, my dear Lady Bridgelow.

348
00:34:32,447 --> 00:34:33,901
我沒什麼好抱怨的
I should not complain.

349
00:34:34,263 --> 00:34:36,572
我有兒子 也是阿爾伯特的骨肉
I have my son, in whom Albert lives on.

350
00:34:37,820 --> 00:34:39,562
他們兩人非常相似
The resemblance is very strong.

351
00:34:40,767 --> 00:34:44,317
相信等你有了兒子也會是這樣
I don't doubt it will be the same for you when you have a son.

352
00:34:47,506 --> 00:34:48,727
一定會的
I dare say it will.

353
00:34:53,215 --> 00:34:54,481
你找我姊姊?
You're visiting my sister?

354
00:34:55,082 --> 00:34:57,211
對 她身體還好吧
yes. I trust she is well.

355
00:34:57,212 --> 00:34:58,472
她身體當然不好
Of course she's not well.

356
00:34:58,986 --> 00:35:02,887
動動腦子 老兄 別賴着不走勞她費神
Use your sense, man. Don't stay too long and tire her out.

357
00:35:08,496 --> 00:35:10,559
你好像有點蒼白
You are perhaps a little pale.

358
00:35:12,692 --> 00:35:14,251
外表沒什麼意義
Appearances mean so little.

359
00:35:14,992 --> 00:35:17,584
我親愛的伯蒂當年總是紅潤健康
My dear Bertie appeared to be in the pink of health always,

360
00:35:17,585 --> 00:35:20,616
結果他先走了 我還活着
yet he is gone and I remain.

361
00:35:37,770 --> 00:35:40,211
我眞盼望好起來 亨利
Oh, I am so anxious to be well, Henry.

362
00:35:41,909 --> 00:35:43,440
因爲沒有小孩要照顧
With no children to look after

363
00:35:43,441 --> 00:35:46,096
我的精力都留給了慈善事業
I have saved all my juices for the cause.

364
00:35:47,723 --> 00:35:49,302
我知道他們很感激
I know the cause is grateful.

365
00:35:49,393 --> 00:35:52,251
日復一日 我飽受折磨
I sit here tormented knowing each day that passes

366
00:35:52,252 --> 00:35:55,485
又一個女人墮入生命的罪惡
one more woman sinks into a life of unbridled vice.

367
00:35:55,486 --> 00:35:56,509
福克斯太太
Mrs Fox,

368
00:35:57,297 --> 00:36:01,008
我想告訴你我也開始在聖吉爾斯工作了
I want you to know that I have myself begun to work in St Giles.

369
00:36:01,295 --> 00:36:03,928
你 亨利?       所以你可以放心休息
You, Henry?        So you must rest easy in the knowledge

370
00:36:03,929 --> 00:36:06,720
會有人替你露面的
that a presence is maintained.

371
00:36:08,867 --> 00:36:10,901
我知道你和我感受相同
I knew that you felt as I do.

372
00:36:13,175 --> 00:36:14,100
是的
I do.

373
00:36:20,361 --> 00:36:21,395
你好 先生
Hello, sir.

374
00:36:22,407 --> 00:36:25,207
想要一個價廉物美的好姑娘嗎?
Want a nice girl, not expensive?

375
00:36:26,246 --> 00:36:28,944
我只想和你聊聊
I wish only to talk with you.

376
00:36:35,546 --> 00:36:38,818
很好 來我房間吧
Very good. Come to my house.

377
00:36:39,669 --> 00:36:41,733
不 我就是那個意思
No, no, I mean what I say.

378
00:36:44,175 --> 00:36:45,071
一個先令
A shilling,

379
00:36:46,525 --> 00:36:47,530
只是聊聊
just to talk.

380
00:36:54,621 --> 00:36:56,179
你寫下來有什麼用?
What you writing it down for?

381
00:36:56,990 --> 00:37:00,094
我臨時代替我朋友
Oh, I am temporarily taking over the work of a dear friend

382
00:37:00,095 --> 00:37:01,454
救濟社的工作
in the Rescue Society.

383
00:37:01,455 --> 00:37:05,081
所以準備把細節一一彙報給她       很好
I intend to report back in every detail.        nice.

384
00:37:06,205 --> 00:37:08,429
反正你付了一先令了 儘管問吧
Well, you've paid your shilling, don't be shy.

385
00:37:10,867 --> 00:37:13,939
如果你不介意的話 卡羅萊
when, if you don't mind, Caroline,

386
00:37:14,427 --> 00:37:17,260
你是什麼時候失去了貞操?
did you lose your virtue?

387
00:37:18,648 --> 00:37:19,850
十六歲
Age 16.

388
00:37:20,422 --> 00:37:21,661
給了我丈夫
To my husband.

389
00:37:22,641 --> 00:37:23,726
給了你丈夫?
To your husband?

390
00:37:24,533 --> 00:37:26,239
那也不算失掉了貞操
Ah, well then you did not lose your virtue.

391
00:37:26,474 --> 00:37:29,604
所以你離開了他 或者被抛棄了?
So you must have left him, then, or been cast out?

392
00:37:30,455 --> 00:37:31,799
他死了 先生
He died, sir.

393
00:37:33,053 --> 00:37:35,236
之後我的小男孩也跟着走了
Then my little boy followed close behind.

394
00:37:36,874 --> 00:37:38,048
眞的深表遺憾
I am deeply sorry.

395
00:37:39,205 --> 00:37:41,917
所以這是你墮落的原因?
So, that is when you fell into this way of being?

396
00:37:42,104 --> 00:37:43,983
不是墮落 是別無它選
I didn't fall, I was pushed.

397
00:37:45,269 --> 00:37:47,177
孩子的藥錢還欠着醫生
Owed the doctor for the child's medicine.

398
00:37:47,829 --> 00:37:49,969
是他安排我踏入這行的
He arranged my start in the profession.

399
00:37:51,338 --> 00:37:52,360
醫生?
The doctor?

400
00:37:54,521 --> 00:37:55,350
我明白了
I see.

401
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:58,444
好的 容我冒昧提出
Well, forgive me,

402
00:37:59,355 --> 00:38:02,559
我認識一個大工廠主
I know a man who runs a great concern.

403
00:38:02,646 --> 00:38:04,455
我可以爲你安排一份工作
I could arrange employment for you.

404
00:38:04,456 --> 00:38:05,812
我有工作
I have employment.

405
00:38:05,918 --> 00:38:08,433
一份你不會遭天譴的工作
Employment by which you would not risk damnation.

406
00:38:08,934 --> 00:38:10,841
我有工作
I have employment!

407
00:38:11,798 --> 00:38:13,994
你想讓我在血汗工廠透支健康
You want me to break my health in a dirty factory

408
00:38:13,995 --> 00:38:16,814
領着一週兩先令 爲你朋友創造財富?
for two shillings a week to help your friend make his fortune?

409
00:38:17,870 --> 00:38:20,221
一先令的談話時間結束了
Now, your shilling's long since up.

410
00:38:20,256 --> 00:38:24,475
卡羅萊 你相信你擁有靈魂嗎?
Caroline! Do you believe you have a soul?

411
00:38:27,586 --> 00:38:29,865
你有的 我都有
Anything you got, I got, too.

412
00:38:30,881 --> 00:38:32,555
你不爲它擔心嗎?
Then don't you fear for it?

413
00:38:34,105 --> 00:38:35,891
我沒什麼好擔心的
You know, I fear nothing much

414
00:38:36,851 --> 00:38:39,978
因爲我愛過 也被愛過
because I've loved and I've been loved.

415
00:38:41,015 --> 00:38:42,658
這不正是靈魂的含義嗎?
Ain't that what a soul's about?

416
00:38:55,794 --> 00:38:59,994
哥哥?       我需要和你談談 威廉
Brother?        Oh, I need to talk to you, William.

417
00:39:00,597 --> 00:39:02,688
我剛從伯明翰回來
I've only just returned from Birmingham

418
00:39:02,689 --> 00:39:05,125
需要去瑪麗勒本見一個重要的人
and I've an important appointment I need to make in Marylebone.

419
00:39:05,126 --> 00:39:06,425
我是來懺悔的...
It is a confession...

420
00:39:07,383 --> 00:39:08,577
某種程度上
of sorts.

421
00:39:13,273 --> 00:39:14,454
坐下吧 亨利
Sit down, Henry.

422
00:39:27,437 --> 00:39:28,261
夫人
Ma'am.

423
00:39:34,503 --> 00:39:36,035
(英格蘭銀行)

424
00:40:00,003 --> 00:40:02,835
他打扮得衣冠楚楚 超凡脱俗
He dresses it up as spiritual poppycock, of course,

425
00:40:02,836 --> 00:40:08,225
事實上亨利戀愛了 卻拉不下臉承認
but the fact is that Henry's on heat and too priggish to admit it.

426
00:40:10,261 --> 00:40:12,075
那你給他什麼建議?
So how did you advise him?

427
00:40:12,616 --> 00:40:16,958
我告訴他 這些對福克斯的太太的感覺
I simply told him that the feelings he had for Mrs Fox

428
00:40:16,959 --> 00:40:19,264
全是熱戀的典型症狀
bared all the hallmarks of infatuation

429
00:40:19,265 --> 00:40:21,685
只能順其自然了
and they would simply run their course.

430
00:40:23,408 --> 00:40:24,827
今天吸引我們的東西
What enthrals us today

431
00:40:24,828 --> 00:40:26,979
明天也許什麼都不是了
may simply have no hold tomorrow.

432
00:40:31,832 --> 00:40:32,917
的確
Indeed.

433
00:40:35,564 --> 00:40:36,670
可憐的威廉
Poor William.

434
00:40:37,327 --> 00:40:39,852
整個世界都塞給你麻煩
The whole world runs to you with its troubles.

435
00:40:42,527 --> 00:40:43,774
只除了你
All except you.

436
00:40:44,009 --> 00:40:45,318
我有什麼麻煩呢?
What troubles have I?

437
00:40:45,935 --> 00:40:48,266
我是世上最幸運的女人
I am the luckiest woman alive.

438
00:40:53,325 --> 00:40:55,063
我眞希望在這裏沈沈的睡去
I wish I could just fall asleep here.

439
00:40:55,556 --> 00:40:56,582
好啊
Well, do.

440
00:40:58,181 --> 00:40:59,629
我明天必須早起
I have to be up early tomorrow.

441
00:41:00,829 --> 00:41:02,565
必須去熏衣草田裏
I have to go into the lavender fields.

442
00:41:04,871 --> 00:41:06,269
熏衣草田?
The lavender fields?

443
00:41:07,359 --> 00:41:09,405
熏衣草眞正生長的地方?
Where the lavender actually grows?

444
00:41:11,124 --> 00:41:12,228
可以帶我去嗎?
Won't you take me?

445
00:41:14,902 --> 00:41:16,183
樂意之至
I would love nothing more.

446
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:20,476
不過...
But...

447
00:41:27,821 --> 00:41:28,992
我明白
I understand.

448
00:41:37,263 --> 00:41:39,272
可惜你沒有監護人
It's a shame you don't have a chaperone.

449
00:41:40,749 --> 00:41:43,282
比如一位善良的老紳士來讓此行
Some kindly old gent to add a veneer of

450
00:41:43,283 --> 00:41:45,225
看上去體面一些
respectability to the exercise.

451
00:41:51,499 --> 00:41:52,796
我想撒尿
I need to pee.

452
00:41:53,850 --> 00:41:56,294
把這裏當家 尿到褲子上吧
Pretend you're at home and do it in your pants.

453
00:41:56,531 --> 00:41:58,329
眞是熱心腸
So kind-hearted.

454
00:41:58,859 --> 00:42:01,278
六先令和威士忌 記得嗎?
Six shillings and whisky, remember?

455
00:42:01,372 --> 00:42:02,912
享受陽光吧
Enjoy the sunshine.

456
00:42:03,062 --> 00:42:05,877
他們説好幾週前開始修剪這些花叢了
They claim they've been pruning these bushes for weeks.

457
00:42:06,740 --> 00:42:08,515
其實是昨天下午吧
Yesterday afternoon, more like.

458
00:42:08,885 --> 00:42:10,640
眞不可思議
It really is magnificent.

459
00:42:11,932 --> 00:42:13,780
比我想象的還要大
Bigger than I'd ever imagined.

460
00:42:15,223 --> 00:42:17,533
如果來場大火 怎樣?
What a bonfire this'd make, eh?

461
00:42:17,750 --> 00:42:21,316
事實上 我們在第五年的秋天會把它們燒掉
Actually, we do burn all the plants in their fifth autumn.

462
00:42:22,316 --> 00:42:25,937
火焰中的香氣可以迷醉整個米査姆區
The blaze is fragrant enough to cause all of Mitcham to swoon.

463
00:42:28,084 --> 00:42:29,437
我正在找你
I've been looking for you!

464
00:42:29,438 --> 00:42:32,212
最多六個月 你就捲舖蓋走人了
Give it six months and you'll be out on your arse.

465
00:42:32,886 --> 00:42:35,157
你不知道你在説什麼吧
You don't know what you're talking about.

466
00:42:41,422 --> 00:42:44,099
髒東西纔不喝呢 是吧
Oh, don't let anything dirty pass your lips.

467
00:42:49,922 --> 00:42:51,402
令人窒息的美
It is breathtaking.

468
00:42:55,875 --> 00:42:58,056
如果我膝下有一個兒子的話
If only I had a son to leave it to.

469
00:43:03,492 --> 00:43:04,605
親愛的威廉
Dear William.

470
00:43:11,660 --> 00:43:13,869
新鮮的空氣 很適合你
It suits you, the fresh air.

471
00:43:33,143 --> 00:43:35,355
下面又流血了
'Bleeding again, underneath.

472
00:43:35,362 --> 00:43:37,265
我肯定這都是吃東西造成的
'I am certain it's caused by eating.

473
00:43:37,266 --> 00:43:39,201
如果不吃飯 就不會流血了
'If I don't eat, I don't bleed,

474
00:43:39,364 --> 00:43:42,166
可我會暈倒 他們會找科魯來
'but then I get faint and they summon Curlew.

475
00:43:42,564 --> 00:43:43,974
我的天使呢?
'Where is my angel?

476
00:43:44,097 --> 00:43:46,062
好久沒有見到她了
'I have not seen her in so long.

477
00:43:46,843 --> 00:43:49,239
也許我不配擁有她
'Perhaps I have not deserved her.'

478
00:43:54,018 --> 00:43:55,918
有些汙垢永遠也別想清除
Some stains you never get out.

479
00:44:19,738 --> 00:44:20,604
謝謝
Thank you.

480
00:44:23,315 --> 00:44:24,455
可以坐起來了
You may sit up.

481
00:44:26,331 --> 00:44:28,472
恐怕得説一切並不理想
I'm afraid all is not as it should be.

482
00:44:29,041 --> 00:44:30,480
你的子宮已經移位
Your womb has moved.

483
00:44:31,196 --> 00:44:33,462
比應該在的地方高了 所以...
It's much higher than where it ought to be, which is...

484
00:44:35,944 --> 00:44:39,661
拉克漢太太 你在看什麼特別的東西嗎?
Mrs Rackham, are you looking at anything in particular?

485
00:44:40,378 --> 00:44:42,833
我在尋找東西 科魯醫生
I'm looking for something, Dr Curlew.

486
00:44:43,214 --> 00:44:45,785
什麼?       一個信號
What?        A sign.

487
00:45:00,715 --> 00:45:03,697
我建議艾格尼絲多關注家務
I suggest Agnes take more interest in the household.

488
00:45:05,607 --> 00:45:08,833
接下來 她就眞的擦去地板了
Next thing I know, she's actually scrubbing.

489
00:45:12,912 --> 00:45:15,343
科魯認爲她必須被監管起來
Curlew's adamant she must be secured.

490
00:45:15,757 --> 00:45:16,506
不
No.

491
00:45:17,695 --> 00:45:19,911
艾格尼絲去精神病院 那要她怎麼活
Surely Agnes would never survive an asylum.

492
00:45:19,912 --> 00:45:21,190
我也告訴過他
I've told him that.

493
00:45:22,251 --> 00:45:23,439
一模一樣
Exactly.

494
00:45:24,633 --> 00:45:27,814
可怕的是 前一天她還和正常人一樣
Awful thing is one day she's normal as you or I

495
00:45:28,376 --> 00:45:29,468
接着
and the next...

496
00:45:31,580 --> 00:45:33,132
就會和天使招手
..she's waving at angels.

497
00:45:40,748 --> 00:45:42,464
艾格尼絲患病多久了?
How long has Agnes been this way?

498
00:45:45,372 --> 00:45:46,615
老實説
If I'm honest,

499
00:45:47,770 --> 00:45:51,052
她的瘋狂從生孩子開始就萌芽了
her madness has blossomed since the child.

500
00:45:52,959 --> 00:45:54,510
她流産了一個小孩?
Agnes lost a child?

501
00:45:55,507 --> 00:45:56,806
不 孩子生下來了
No, we have a child.

502
00:45:59,120 --> 00:46:00,101
你們有小孩?
You have?

503
00:46:00,637 --> 00:46:01,462
是的
Yes.

504
00:46:03,079 --> 00:46:05,281
不幸的是 是個女孩
A daughter, unfortunately.

505
00:46:06,225 --> 00:46:07,177
索菲
Sophie.

506
00:46:09,178 --> 00:46:10,139
索菲
Sophie.

507
00:46:11,258 --> 00:46:12,561
很少見她
See very little of her.

508
00:46:13,790 --> 00:46:17,320
匆匆瞟過幾眼 就被護士帶去教堂了
The odd glimpse as she's being swept off to church by her nurse.

509
00:46:19,098 --> 00:46:20,751
又一個災難臨頭
another looming disaster.

510
00:46:20,926 --> 00:46:23,876
克萊弗女士説索菲需要一個家庭教師
Miss Cleave claims that Sophie needs a governess.

511
00:46:24,319 --> 00:46:26,852
八歳的小孩需要上學嗎?
Does a child of eight need schooling?

512
00:46:27,398 --> 00:46:28,786
還是個女孩
A girl, too!

513
00:46:30,155 --> 00:46:32,748
每週想多跟我要一先令罷了
Trying to bounce another shilling out of me a week,

514
00:46:32,749 --> 00:46:33,863
毋庸置疑
I don't doubt.

515
00:46:40,617 --> 00:46:43,638
我多麼渴望能和你住在一起
I wish for all the world I could live with you.

516
00:46:52,279 --> 00:46:57,617
「喜樂」基督勸勉我們説「應當歡喜快樂」
Rejoice, Christ exhorts us, and be exceeding glad,

517
00:46:57,617 --> 00:47:00,280
「因爲你們在天上的賞賜是大的」
for great is your reward in heaven

518
00:47:00,280 --> 00:47:03,958
「在你們以前的先知 人也是這樣逼迫他們」
for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you.

519
00:47:04,891 --> 00:47:06,870
「你們是世上的鹽」
Ye are the salt of the earth,

520
00:47:07,375 --> 00:47:09,973
「鹽若失了味」
but if the salt have lost his savour,

521
00:47:09,973 --> 00:47:11,978
「怎能叫他再鹹呢?」
wherewith shall it be salted?

522
00:47:12,701 --> 00:47:14,692
「以後無用」
It is thenceforth good for nothing,

523
00:47:14,979 --> 00:47:16,473
「不過丟在外面」(語出《馬太福音》5:12)
but to be cast out...

524
00:47:40,274 --> 00:47:42,630
科魯醫生
Why, Dr Curlew.

525
00:47:45,713 --> 00:47:46,604
亨利
Henry.

526
00:47:51,843 --> 00:47:54,650
我今天收到了福克斯太太的信
I received a message from Mrs Fox today.

527
00:47:55,495 --> 00:47:56,278
是嗎?
Indeed?

528
00:47:57,645 --> 00:48:00,801
聽説她要被送去海邊養病了
I gather she is to be sent away to the coast to recover.

529
00:48:02,815 --> 00:48:04,524
是的 她會去福克斯通
She is going to Folkestone, yes.

530
00:48:06,208 --> 00:48:07,373
這倒不假
That much is true.

531
00:48:09,160 --> 00:48:12,143
你知道她會在那裏待多久嗎?
Do you have you any idea how long she'll be there?

532
00:48:15,581 --> 00:48:19,068
以我對這個病的瞭解
I imagine, given my experience of the disease,

533
00:48:19,937 --> 00:48:21,300
不會太久
not long at all.

534
00:48:22,437 --> 00:48:24,152
最多幾個月
A couple of months at most.

535
00:48:25,281 --> 00:48:26,731
她會去這麼久?
She'll be gone so long?

536
00:48:27,979 --> 00:48:28,916
好吧...
Well, I...

537
00:48:29,468 --> 00:48:33,112
她不在的時候 我要努力打發時間了
I shall strive to find ways to pass the time until she's back.

538
00:48:33,676 --> 00:48:36,131
上帝啊 你們家族的男人腦子都有問題嗎?
Dear God, what is the matter with the men in your family?

539
00:48:36,626 --> 00:48:37,985
你什麼都不明白嗎?
Do you understand nothing?!

540
00:48:38,696 --> 00:48:40,666
我妹妹得肺結核快死了
My sister is dying of consumption.

541
00:48:41,996 --> 00:48:43,428
再也不回來了
She'll never come back.

542
00:48:56,372 --> 00:48:57,123
亨利?
Henry?

543
00:48:58,656 --> 00:49:00,110
希望是你
I hoped it was you.

544
00:49:02,100 --> 00:49:03,651
什麼耽擱你這麼久
But what kept you?

545
00:49:06,057 --> 00:49:07,549
沒什麼能耽擱我
Nothing kept me.

546
00:49:07,819 --> 00:49:11,572
等你的時間 實在太漫長了
Time passes so slowly for me when I am waiting for you.

547
00:49:15,570 --> 00:49:17,085
福克斯太太
Mrs Fox,

548
00:49:17,824 --> 00:49:20,207
我並不値得你這樣
I am not worthy.

549
00:49:20,411 --> 00:49:21,858
哦 你値得...       不
Oh, but you are...        No!

550
00:49:23,597 --> 00:49:25,776
我對你的感覺 使我不再懷疑
My feelings for you leave me in no doubt

551
00:49:25,777 --> 00:49:29,014
我天生不是做傳教士的料
I am not cut out to be a clergyman.

552
00:49:29,015 --> 00:49:30,690
亨利 別説了
Henry, stop.

553
00:49:30,691 --> 00:49:34,658
看到你受此懲罰我很憤怒
I rage to see you punished in this way!

554
00:49:34,864 --> 00:49:38,003
上帝遠比一個女人的疾病偉大
God is bigger than one woman's illness.

555
00:49:38,579 --> 00:49:45,304
你會是最善良 最眞誠 最慷慨的牧師
You would make the kindest, sincerest, handsomest minister.

556
00:49:45,305 --> 00:49:46,344
原諒我
Forgive me.

557
00:50:08,033 --> 00:50:11,086
你今晚不和我們一起嗎 艾格尼絲?
Are you quite sure you won't join us this evening, Agnes?

558
00:50:12,188 --> 00:50:14,217
我知道你很喜歡亨利
I know how fond you are of Henry.

559
00:50:15,358 --> 00:50:18,541
科魯先生讓我別參加社交活動
Dr Curlew has advised against socialising.

560
00:50:22,771 --> 00:50:24,784
我想他也説過別花太多時間
I think he also said it might be better not to spend

561
00:50:24,785 --> 00:50:27,686
坐在窗戶邊 親愛的
so much time sitting at the window, dearest.

562
00:50:29,538 --> 00:50:31,650
你不相信有天使 對嗎?
You don't believe in angels, do you?

563
00:50:34,314 --> 00:50:35,427
是的 不相信
No, I don't.

564
00:50:37,242 --> 00:50:40,585
你誰都不相信 除了威廉·拉克漢
You don't believe in anything except William Rackham.

565
00:50:55,151 --> 00:50:56,998
她快死了 比爾
She's dying, Bill!

566
00:50:56,999 --> 00:50:59,970
不 她服用新葯後更荒謬敏感了
No, she's absurdly highly strung and on new medication.

567
00:50:59,971 --> 00:51:03,189
福克斯太太快死了
Mrs Fox is dying.

568
00:51:03,677 --> 00:51:05,511
他哥哥説沒希望了
Her brother says there's no hope.

569
00:51:09,501 --> 00:51:12,225
她的眼神看穿我的靈魂 比爾
She stares into my soul, Bill.

570
00:51:12,226 --> 00:51:14,872
她乞求的眼神       你們倆...
Those imploring eyes.        You two had...

571
00:51:15,678 --> 00:51:18,575
關係發展迅速
grown surprisingly close.

572
00:51:18,576 --> 00:51:21,802
她的胸口起伏
Her breast heaves.

573
00:51:23,241 --> 00:51:25,504
喘息的抓住我的手
She pants and clutches at my hand.

574
00:51:25,505 --> 00:51:28,135
有你在身邊安慰 她眞幸運 亨利
How lucky she is to have you to comfort her, Henry.

575
00:51:28,136 --> 00:51:29,208
感覺像...
It is as if...

576
00:51:30,302 --> 00:51:34,369
感覺她還想向我要什麼東西
As if she wants something more from me.

577
00:51:34,370 --> 00:51:35,719
一點也不驚訝
It's not surprising.

578
00:51:35,998 --> 00:51:39,298
我問自己一遍又一遍
I ask myself over and over and over

579
00:51:39,299 --> 00:51:41,969
她要我給他什麼?
what is it she thinks I can give her?

580
00:51:42,597 --> 00:51:43,868
你不是開玩笑吧?
Are you serious?

581
00:51:45,345 --> 00:51:47,413
我向主禱告 從早到晚
I have prayed for guidance, night and day!

582
00:51:47,414 --> 00:51:49,164
可憐啊 亨利
For pity's sake, Henry!

583
00:51:50,898 --> 00:51:53,223
她想讓你好好看着她
She wants you to give her a good seeing to!

584
00:51:55,287 --> 00:51:57,703
她想和你好好做愛 亨利
She wants you to give her a good fucking, Henry!

585
00:52:01,579 --> 00:52:04,467
你是禽獸嗎...?
What sort of a creature...?

586
00:52:04,695 --> 00:52:06,940
這屋子再也呆不下去了
I can't stay in this house.

587
00:52:08,731 --> 00:52:10,095
別再折磨她了 亨利
Stop tormenting her, Henry!

588
00:52:10,096 --> 00:52:13,583
如果她眞的快死了 讓她最後歡愉一次吧
If she really is dying, just let her feel pleasure at least once!

589
00:53:28,721 --> 00:53:31,493
威廉 怎麼回事?
William, what is it?

590
00:53:34,314 --> 00:53:36,096
我讓馬車伕黎明就來
I've asked Cheesman to come at dawn.

591
00:53:36,777 --> 00:53:38,924
我們直接去熏衣草田
We will leave for the lavender fields straightaway.

592
00:53:39,763 --> 00:53:42,236
那...       爲什麼要管別人想什麼?
What about...        What do I care what people think?

593
00:53:43,290 --> 00:53:46,385
這他媽是我的熏衣草田 我的生意
It's my damn lavender field, it's my damn business!

594
00:53:46,668 --> 00:53:48,714
我厭倦了被那些白癡評判
I'm sick of being judged by fools

595
00:53:48,715 --> 00:53:50,488
那些對世界一無所知的人
who have no idea how the world works,

596
00:53:50,489 --> 00:53:52,559
那些人之所以滿口道德良心
who have the luxury of a clear conscience

597
00:53:52,560 --> 00:53:57,217
都因爲騎在我這種骯髒俗人的頭上
because I pay for it on a dirty, daily basis!

598
00:54:32,403 --> 00:54:33,529
《聖經》
Holy Bible

599
00:55:28,219 --> 00:55:29,493
福克斯太太?
Mrs Fox?

600
00:55:33,695 --> 00:55:35,296
你氣色眞好
You look so well.

601
00:55:35,296 --> 00:55:36,652
當然了 亨利
Of course, Henry.

602
00:55:37,176 --> 00:55:38,574
我已經去天堂了
I'm in heaven.

603
00:55:49,919 --> 00:55:52,343
等不及想讓你也來了
I can't wait for you to join me.

604
00:55:57,414 --> 00:55:58,933
我想和你一起
I want to join you.

605
00:56:00,164 --> 00:56:01,210
我很想...
I want to...

606
00:56:03,165 --> 00:56:04,987
可我們沒有結婚
but we are not married.

607
00:56:06,865 --> 00:56:09,091
天堂裏沒有嫁娶 亨利
There is no marriage in heaven, Henry.

608
00:56:09,562 --> 00:56:11,583
《馬可福音》12章25節
Mark 12:25.

609
00:56:15,223 --> 00:56:16,395
福克斯太太...
Mrs Fox...

610
00:56:53,883 --> 00:56:55,402
如果我和你住在一起
If only I could live with you.

611
00:56:57,184 --> 00:56:58,726
該是多大的幫助啊
You are such a help to me.

612
00:57:00,041 --> 00:57:01,699
我希望能多幫助你一些
I wish I could help you more.

613
00:57:03,357 --> 00:57:06,891
其實不只是亨利和艾格尼絲
It's not only Henry and Agnes.

614
00:57:07,654 --> 00:57:10,004
整棟房子都失控了
The entire household is out of control.

615
00:57:10,926 --> 00:57:14,366
艾格尼絲的女僕公然蔑視我
Agnes' maid treats me with open contempt,

616
00:57:15,013 --> 00:57:16,777
克萊弗小姐也終於遞了辭呈
Miss Cleave has finally handed notice,

617
00:57:16,778 --> 00:57:18,761
我只能再找家庭教師了
so now I have to find a new governess.

618
00:57:23,625 --> 00:57:25,527
你説和我住在一起是認眞的?
Are you serious about living with me?

619
00:57:28,423 --> 00:57:29,987
當然是認眞的
Of course I am...

620
00:57:31,755 --> 00:57:33,330
但這不可能
..but it's impossible.

621
00:57:36,858 --> 00:57:41,232
我不能作爲家庭教師 和你住在一起嗎?
Could I not, in fact, live with you as your new governess?

622
00:57:44,767 --> 00:57:47,587
拉克漢先生       你不是認眞的吧?
Mr Rackham!        You're not serious?

623
00:57:50,448 --> 00:57:52,346
抱歉       拉克漢先生
I'm sorry.        Mr Rackham!

624
00:57:52,615 --> 00:57:53,854
我只是想...
I only thought...

625
00:57:55,443 --> 00:57:56,286
拉克漢先生
Mr Rackham!

626
00:57:59,519 --> 00:58:00,386
先生
Sir!

627
00:58:00,506 --> 00:58:02,936
你快去 先生 馬上
You're wanted, sir, at once!

628
00:58:03,389 --> 00:58:04,678
是你的哥哥
It's your brother!

629
00:58:26,402 --> 00:58:30,202
