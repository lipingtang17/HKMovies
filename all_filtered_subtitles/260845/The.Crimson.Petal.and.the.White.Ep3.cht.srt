1
00:00:01,146 --> 00:00:03,280
十九年前 我們開始相依爲命
19 years since we embarked on this life together.

2
00:00:03,315 --> 00:00:05,710
六年前 你悄悄走到我房間裏説
Six since you tiptoed to my room and told me

3
00:00:05,745 --> 00:00:08,105
有位先生給我取暖來了
there was a gentleman come to keep me warm.

4
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:09,725
我對蘇糖的專屬佔有權
Exclusive patronage of Sugar, by me.

5
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:12,440
過了這麼些年 你要離開我們啦
You're leaving us, then? After all these years?

6
00:00:12,475 --> 00:00:14,337
這是什麼?
What is this?

7
00:00:14,372 --> 00:00:16,200
這是你的
This is yours.

8
00:00:16,235 --> 00:00:18,167
也是我的
And mine.

9
00:00:18,202 --> 00:00:20,938
有位幸運的先生把傳説中的蘇糖買走了
Some lucky gent has taken the legendary Sugar off the market.

10
00:00:20,973 --> 00:00:23,194
我們還沒享受到她的魅力呢
Before we'd had the benefit of her charms.

11
00:00:23,229 --> 00:00:26,280
恐怕得説一切並不理想 你的子宮已經移位
I'm afraid all is not as it should be. Your womb has moved.

12
00:00:26,315 --> 00:00:28,765
艾格尼絲流産過?
Agnes lost a child?

13
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,308
不 孩子生下來了      你們有小孩?
No, we have a child. We have?

14
00:00:32,343 --> 00:00:33,445
是個女孩 索菲
A daughter. Sophie.

15
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:36,704
不舒服時 我就吃上兩片
On bad days I take a couple of these.

16
00:00:37,332 --> 00:00:42,845
相信我 你會連自己都不認得的
Trust me, you will hardly know yourself.

17
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:46,400
我有個守護天使      我會回來找你的
I have a guardian angel. I will come back for you.

18
00:00:46,435 --> 00:00:49,920
我多麼渴望能和你住在一起
I wish for all the world that I could live with you.

19
00:00:49,955 --> 00:00:51,720
你們家族的男人腦子都有問題嗎?
What is the matter with the men in your family?

20
00:00:51,755 --> 00:00:55,602
福克斯太太快死了
Mrs Fox is dying.

21
00:00:55,637 --> 00:00:56,760
等不及想讓你也來了
I can't wait for you to join me.

22
00:00:57,260 --> 00:00:59,385
我不能作爲家庭教師
Could I not, in fact,

23
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:01,860
和你住在一起嗎?
live with you as your new governess?

24
00:01:01,895 --> 00:01:04,465
你不是認眞的吧?
You're not serious?

25
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:07,500
(本片含有部分性場面)
This programme contains scenes of a sexual nature.

29
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,998
又被他們耽擱了
Held up. As usual.

30
00:02:07,033 --> 00:02:10,895
等等你 我胃口更好
Waiting for you has only ever sharpened my appetite.

31
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:13,258
又要梳理亨利的家産
Trying to sort out Henry's estate

32
00:02:13,293 --> 00:02:16,803
還要處理那些雜事 唉
on top of everything else, it's just, ach!

33
00:02:16,838 --> 00:02:20,940
所以我們之間的安排也行不通了
Which is why our current arrangement is no longer viable.

34
00:02:20,975 --> 00:02:23,100
不能再在瑪麗勒本見面了
Marylebone must go.

35
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:27,860
可是威廉...      攤子太大 我管不過來了
But William... I am stretched too thin.

36
00:02:27,895 --> 00:02:30,705
你不是總説...
How often have you said how...

37
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:34,025
我們的見面能讓你放鬆嗎?
restorative you find our time together?

38
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:40,900
沒錯 因此我想讓你搬到切普斯托路去
Indeed. Which is why I would like you to move to Chepstow Villas.

39
00:02:40,935 --> 00:02:42,540
做索菲的家庭教師
And become Sophie's governess.

40
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:46,980
登堂入室
To live in your house?

41
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:53,545
和你住在一起?      你不是也想這樣嗎?
With you? I thought that was what you wanted?

42
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:56,420
你該不是改主意了吧      哦 威廉
Don't tell me you've changed your mind? Oh, William!

43
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:56,600
拉克曼太太
Mrs Rackham!

44
00:03:56,635 --> 00:03:58,745
拉克曼先生?
Mr Rackham?

45
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:00,500
沒空 萊蒂 我忙着呢
Not now, Letty. I'm busy.

46
00:04:00,535 --> 00:04:02,380
可是先生...
But sir...

47
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:16,600
克萊爾發現艾格尼絲在花園裏埋她的日記
Clara has found Agnes burying her diaries in the garden.

48
00:04:16,635 --> 00:04:20,540
日記?      應該是想重新開始吧
Her diaries? Apparently she wants to make a fresh start.

49
00:04:20,575 --> 00:04:23,105
科魯想把她關起來
Curlew wants to lock her up.

50
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:25,700
眞等不及要和你獨處了
I can't wait for you and I to be together.

51
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:32,940
契斯曼 幫蘇糖小姐拿行李
Cheeseman! Take Miss Sugar's bags.

52
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:39,300
我來吧
I'll take that.

53
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:48,900
腳下當心 小姐
Mind yer step, Miss.

54
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:37,700
萊蒂 這是...蘇糖小姐 新家庭教師
Letty, this is... Miss Sugar. Our new governess.

55
00:05:37,735 --> 00:05:38,847
幸會 小姐
How do you do, Miss?

56
00:05:38,882 --> 00:05:42,496
我希望...我相信她在這會很開心的
I hope... I trust she will be happy here.

57
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:46,505
這房子眞美
Such a beautiful house.

58
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:51,620
克萊弗女士上火車前會跟你談的
Miss Cleave will speak with you before she leaves for her train.

59
00:05:51,655 --> 00:05:54,660
請跟我去你的房間
Allow me to show you to your room.

60
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:15,380
這是拉克曼太太的房間
Mrs Rackham's room.

61
00:06:15,415 --> 00:06:17,980
還有我的
And my own.

62
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:39,420
房間沒有你原來的寬敞
The room is not as spacious as you're used to.

63
00:06:39,455 --> 00:06:43,225
對
No.

64
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:46,260
不過能讓我們靠近一些就行了
But it will oblige us to remain very close together.

65
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:55,505
抱歉 先生      放那就行
Excuse me, Sir. Just come through with it.

66
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:58,620
克萊弗女士會給你講我女兒的情況
Miss Cleave will tell you all you need to know about my daughter.

67
00:06:58,655 --> 00:07:01,237
毫無疑問 還有很多別的吩咐
And much more besides, I don't doubt.

68
00:07:01,272 --> 00:07:03,820
拉克曼夫人也會來嗎?
And will Mrs Rackham be joining us?

69
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:07,420
我想不會的
I don't think so.

70
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:12,425
我本來打算心照不宣的
I had hoped this would go without saying,

71
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:15,345
可是你最好能看好索菲
but it would be best if you could take care of Sophie

72
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:20,700
讓拉克曼太太在日常活動中
in a manner that allows Mrs Rackham to go about her general business

73
00:07:20,735 --> 00:07:23,500
見不到索菲
without actually seeing Sophie.

74
00:07:23,535 --> 00:07:26,540
根本不見面?      正是
At all? Exactly.

75
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:31,500
那孩子讓她煩躁
She finds the child disturbing.

76
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:42,460
萊蒂 別放這裏 別放這裏 天啊
Letty! Not in here! Not in here! For heaven's sake!

77
00:07:42,495 --> 00:07:45,980
和其他垃圾一起放更衣室去
Put it in the dressing room with all the other junk...

78
00:07:46,015 --> 00:07:48,780
西班牙獵犬都要有眼色些
I swear a Spaniel takes better instructions.

79
00:07:48,815 --> 00:07:51,500
別推 小心摔壞
No, don't push it! You'll break it.

80
00:07:57,300 --> 00:08:00,065
這反應也太誇張了
This is a preposterous overreaction.

81
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:03,540
恕難苟同 我只是想埋葬過去
You will forgive me if I disagree. I merely wished to bury the past.

82
00:08:03,575 --> 00:08:06,100
不能容許我無牽無掛地向前走嗎?
Am I not permitted to go forward unencumbered?

83
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:18,220
克萊弗女士?
Miss Cleave?

84
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:21,785
眞抱歉 我耽誤你了
Forgive me, I have kept you.

85
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:27,865
蘇糖小姐 我在這個家裏八年了
Miss Sugar. Eight years I have been in this house.

86
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:33,420
從孩子的奶媽當到保姆
In that time I have been both wet and dry nurse to this child.

87
00:08:33,455 --> 00:08:38,940
老天      你會發現 索菲本質不壞
Heavens. You will find Sophie in the main a well-meaning thing.

88
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:45,180
她不笨 可她太容易分心
She isn't stupid but her mind is very easily jolted off the rails.

89
00:08:45,215 --> 00:08:48,345
這種時候就需要嚴格要求
At such times a firm hand is required.

90
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:53,380
不要讓她走上...瘋狂之路
We don't want her going the way of a... a Bedlamite.

91
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:57,420
我會牢記的
I'll bear that in mind.

92
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:01,580
我們有兩套牀單互換
We alternate two sets of sheets.

93
00:09:01,615 --> 00:09:03,220
她還尿牀呢 你知道嗎?
She wets the bed, you know?

94
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:09,980
牀單還沒乾 你得過會再來
The sheets are not yet dry, you'll have to come down later.

95
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:13,660
現在 該把你正式介紹給孩子了
Now, you must be formally introduced to the child.

96
00:09:13,695 --> 00:09:16,157
克萊弗女士 我聽説你要趕火車
Miss Cleave, I believe you have a train to catch.

97
00:09:16,192 --> 00:09:18,620
請讓我自己去見索菲吧
Please allow me to introduce myself to Sophie.

98
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:28,825
那你要當心 這孩子很會裝
Just watch out. She can be quite the little actress.

99
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:33,020
一不小心你就會被她耍的團團轉
She'll twist you round her little finger if you're not careful.

100
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:13,100
早安 索菲...
Good morning, Soph...

101
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:49,985
對不起
Forgive me.

102
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:51,540
你在睡覺
You were sleeping.

103
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:55,740
我是蘇糖小姐
I am Miss Sugar.

104
00:10:55,775 --> 00:10:58,300
你好 小姐
How do you do, Miss?

105
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:06,460
我知道你叫索菲 你和你父親眞像
I know you are Sophie. You so closely resemble your father.

106
00:11:06,495 --> 00:11:11,220
索菲 你還有別的房間嗎?
Sophie, do you have another room?

107
00:11:11,255 --> 00:11:14,545
比如遊戲室?
A playroom, perhaps?

108
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:17,420
那你的玩具放哪裏呢?
So where do you keep your toys?

109
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:21,580
玩具你總該有吧?
You do have toys, don't you?

110
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:24,740
我有他
I have him.

111
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:29,425
他叫唐寧
His name's Twinings.

112
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:31,340
是我爺爺給我的
My grandpa gave him to me.

113
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:36,660
他本來騎着錫做的大象 裏面有茶葉
He was riding a tin elephant with tea inside,

114
00:11:36,695 --> 00:11:39,025
可是那個被他們拿走了
but they took that away.

115
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:42,540
他這麼帥 不能老關在箱子裏啊
He's much too handsome to be shut up in that dusty chest.

116
00:11:42,575 --> 00:11:43,835
克萊弗女士説
Miss Cleave says

117
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:46,954
臭烘烘的舊娃娃不能進我乾淨的房間
I'm not to have a smelly old doll in my good clean room.

118
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:50,980
她説她討厭這張黑臉
She says she doesn't like to look at his black face.

119
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:54,660
克萊弗女士已經走了
Well, Miss Cleave has gone now.

120
00:11:56,180 --> 00:11:58,580
我想讓他和我們一起上課
I should like him to join us for our lessons.

121
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:04,345
現在我躺下睡覺 (兒童晚禱詞 1784)
Now I lay me down to sleep.

122
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:06,652
請主守護我的靈魂
I pray the Lord, my soul to keep.

123
00:12:06,687 --> 00:12:08,889
如果我醒來之前死去
See me safely through the night

124
00:12:08,924 --> 00:12:12,821
請主帶我靈魂同行 阿門
and wake me with the morning light. Amen.

125
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:16,665
怎麼了 有問題嗎?
What... What is it? What's wrong?

126
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:21,080
你像你父親嗎 小姐?      哦
Do you resemble your father, Miss? Oh...

127
00:12:21,115 --> 00:12:25,460
這個問題有意思 索菲
That's a very good question, Sophie.

128
00:12:25,495 --> 00:12:27,300
我倒沒想過
I've never thought about it.

129
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:31,020
還是你比較喜歡你媽媽?
Perhaps you favour your Mama?

130
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:38,300
一點都不喜歡 你喜歡你媽媽麼?
Not at all. Do you favour yours?

131
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:43,660
我也不知道 我生日之後就沒見過她了
I couldn't say. I haven't seen her since my birthday.

132
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:16,665
「親愛的日記 我已經被恐懼攫住」
'Dear diary, I am gripped by terror.

133
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:20,780
「他們叫來科魯醫生 他的黑包嚇壞了我」
'Dr Curlew has been called and his black bag frightens me.

134
00:13:20,815 --> 00:13:22,317
「我求克拉拉別放他進來」
'I have begged Clara not to let him in

135
00:13:22,352 --> 00:13:25,525
「可她説人人都在擔心孩子」
but she prattles that everyone is worried about the baby.

136
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:27,785
「已經夠遲了」
'How very late it is

137
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:29,895
「肯定快了什麼的」
'and that it must come soon.

138
00:13:29,930 --> 00:13:31,935
「這是説誰的孩子?」
'Whose baby can this be?'

139
00:13:31,970 --> 00:13:35,784
「眞希望威廉請人來家裏之前告訴我一聲」
I wish William would inform me about whom he invites to this house. '

140
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:14,220
至愛的
Dearest.

141
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:20,580
我正在想要不要去找你呢
I haven't known whether to come and find you.

142
00:14:20,615 --> 00:14:22,577
不 不 最好別去
No, no, better not.

143
00:14:22,612 --> 00:14:24,505
你過得怎樣?
How are you getting on?

144
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:28,083
後悔來這了 對吧?      一點也沒有
You rue the day you came, don't you? Not at all!

145
00:14:28,118 --> 00:14:31,783
你看上去很疲憊
You have a weary look.

146
00:14:31,818 --> 00:14:34,425
要不要我請個保姆幫你?
Would you like me to hire you a nursery maid?

147
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:37,779
不 不用 我確實沒睡覺
No, that's not necessary. It's true I haven't slept but,

148
00:14:37,814 --> 00:14:39,478
不過那得怪牀
that's because of this bed.

149
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:42,300
太小了 我就知道
It's too small, I knew it.

150
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:46,100
威廉 它還沒被洗禮過呢
William, it hasn't been christened.

151
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:27,775
還記得我們的第一次嗎?
Do you remember our first time?

152
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:32,260
哦 我可夠丟人的
Oh! What a disgrace I was then.

153
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:37,780
可我看出你有很棒的潛質了
But I knew you were a great man in the making.

154
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:43,140
你照顧索菲眞的沒問題嗎?
Are you really managing all right with Sophie?

155
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:46,620
我們在一起很開心
We are very happy.

156
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:51,745
我想知道
I did wonder,

157
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:54,500
她生日是哪天?
when's her birthday?

158
00:15:54,535 --> 00:15:56,473
八月...
August the...

159
00:15:57,177 --> 00:15:59,705
某日 怎麼?
something. Why?

160
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:02,069
哦 索菲告訴我
Well, Sophie told me that

161
00:16:02,104 --> 00:16:05,538
她從生日那天就沒見過艾格尼絲了
she hadn't seen Agnes since her birthday.

162
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:11,860
她是説她出生那天
She means since the day she was born.

163
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:38,500
早安 萊蒂
Good morning, Letty.

164
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:16,620
早安 索菲
Good morning, Sophie.

165
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:26,185
對不起 小姐 我是壞孩子
I'm sorry, Miss. I'm bad.

166
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:31,020
不 索菲 你不是壞孩子
No, Sophie, no, you're not bad.

167
00:17:31,055 --> 00:17:33,265
一點都不是
Not at all.

168
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:35,420
快來擦擦乾淨吧
Let's get you clean.

169
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:43,192
我下面好痛
I'm sore down there.

170
00:17:43,227 --> 00:17:47,643
那是你在濕牀單上睡太久了
Well, you've been sleeping in wet sheets for too long.

171
00:17:47,678 --> 00:17:52,060
克萊弗女士有專門給你準備的藥膏嗎?
Did Miss Cleave have a special cream she used on you?

172
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:57,620
我去給你拿點吧
Well, I'll get you some.

173
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:11,020
我一直期盼着見你 福克斯太太
I cannot tell you how anxious I have been to see you, Mrs Fox.

174
00:18:11,055 --> 00:18:14,140
她們説你近來的康復...
They say your recent recovery is...

175
00:18:14,175 --> 00:18:16,777
完全是個奇蹟
nothing short of miraculous.

176
00:18:16,812 --> 00:18:19,345
奇蹟舉世罕見 拉克曼太太
Miracles are rare, Mrs Rackham.

177
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:23,060
我還是相信我只是被調養痊癒了而已
I prefer to think I was simply nursed back to health.

178
00:18:23,095 --> 00:18:24,745
得了吧
Come now!

179
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:28,820
亨利向我們保證他看到你就要死了
Henry assured us he had seen you on your deathbed!

180
00:18:28,855 --> 00:18:31,300
對 亨利看到的是我最糟的時候
Henry saw me at my very worst, it's true.

181
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:39,580
我也很遺憾      你去的是健康修院
And I regret that. You've been to the Convent of Health...

182
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:44,700
對嗎?
.. haven't you?

183
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:49,580
不 是聖巴多羅買醫院
No. St Bartholomew's Hospital.

184
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:55,682
你是...眞的想告訴我
Are you... Are you seriously asking me to believe that

185
00:18:55,717 --> 00:18:56,981
你被救出
you were snatched

186
00:18:57,016 --> 00:19:01,540
那神祕惡魔的利齒 靠的只是調養好?
from the jaws of you-know-what by nothing more than good nursing?

187
00:19:01,575 --> 00:19:04,820
你説的那家修院我從未耳聞
The convent of which you speak is not known to me.

188
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:11,182
若我捫心自問 福克斯太太
If I am scrupulously honest, Mrs Fox,

189
00:19:11,217 --> 00:19:14,264
我也不知道它的確切位置
its precise location is a mystery to me.

190
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:18,576
幸好 他們給我派了位天使護身
Luckily, they have provided me with an angel escort,

191
00:19:18,611 --> 00:19:21,718
時機成熟就會帶我去的
ready for when the time comes.

192
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:33,425
「我身下的擔架升起」
'The stretcher on which I lie is lifted

193
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:37,380
「經過灑滿陽光的林蔭 被擡向修院大門」
'and carried through the sunlit trees to the gates of the convent.

194
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:42,752
「我聽見來時的火車拉響汽笛
'I hear the train which delivered me hooting and

195
00:19:42,787 --> 00:19:45,026
踏上歸程」
moving off on its return journey.

196
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:51,260
「將我護在羽翼下的天使 她就在門口守候」
'She whom has taken me under her wing is waiting at the gates.

197
00:19:53,780 --> 00:19:55,134
「我被擡進修院
'I'm carried into the convent,

198
00:19:55,169 --> 00:19:58,481
放在它中心的一間溫暖小房間」
into a warm cell at its very heart,

199
00:19:58,516 --> 00:20:02,020
「彩繪玻璃窗之下 五光十色」
'which glows in colours from the stained-glass windows. '

200
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:30,340
相信我
Trust me.

201
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:41,420
早安 索菲
Morning, Sophie!

202
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:48,980
索菲 好姑娘
Sophie, good girl.

203
00:21:49,015 --> 00:21:51,740
謝謝 小姐
Thank you, Miss.

204
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:00,792
今天要辛苦了 拉克曼太太?
Hard at work, today, Mrs Rackham?

205
00:22:00,827 --> 00:22:02,918
是啊 克拉拉
Yes, indeed, Clara.

206
00:22:02,953 --> 00:22:04,572
如果波德利和阿什韋
If Bodley and Ashwell,

207
00:22:04,607 --> 00:22:07,054
威廉的笨蛋朋友可以出版
those idiot friends of William's, can publish books

208
00:22:07,089 --> 00:22:09,502
他們那些生活隨感的書
that are no more than their opinions about life,

209
00:22:09,537 --> 00:22:11,214
我爲什麼不能?
well, why can't I?

210
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:13,140
您在寫書?
You're writing a book?

211
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:19,217
就像寫日記 只不過是拿去出版的
It will be like my diary, but for the public.

212
00:22:19,252 --> 00:22:22,374
好多同道中人都在翹首期盼
A great web of like-minded souls all waiting on

213
00:22:22,409 --> 00:22:23,886
「艾格尼絲·皮戈特的
The Illuminated Thoughts and

214
00:22:23,921 --> 00:22:26,764
眞知灼見與奇思妙想」呢
Preternatural Reflections of Agnes Piggott.

215
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:29,500
那纔是我的閨名 你知道嗎?
That's my real name, you know?

216
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:33,220
聽起來很有趣
It sounds fascinating.

217
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:40,625
要是我沒把舊日記都埋掉就好了
If only I hadn't buried all my old writings.

218
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:43,740
那可是多好的研究素材呀
They'd have been such invaluable research material.

219
00:22:43,775 --> 00:22:46,820
哦 我相信它們的源泉還會靈感噴涌的
Oh, I'm sure there's plenty more where that came from.

220
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:50,100
對
Yes.

221
00:22:56,420 --> 00:22:58,380
新書      我朝你父親要的
New books! I asked your father for them.

222
00:22:58,415 --> 00:23:00,580
你舊的那些都過時了
Your old ones are out of date.

223
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:05,665
歷史在前進
History is on the move.

224
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:09,540
你每天都在變 你身邊的世界也在變
You change every day and so does everything around you.

225
00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:12,900
連你也是?
Even you?

226
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:16,020
連我也是
Even me.

227
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:19,844
貓頭鷹和貓咪出海去玩兒
The owl and the pussycat went to sea

228
00:23:19,879 --> 00:23:23,791
坐着豆綠色的船兒 (「貓頭鷹和貓咪」李爾 1871)
in a beautiful pea-green boat

229
00:23:23,826 --> 00:23:26,534
他們帶了點蜂蜜 錢帶的不少
They had some honey and plenty of money

230
00:23:26,569 --> 00:23:28,743
外邊包上一張五塊錢的鈔票
wrapped up in a five-pound note

231
00:23:28,778 --> 00:23:31,552
貓頭鷹看一眼天上的月亮
The owl looked up at the stars above and

232
00:23:31,587 --> 00:23:34,450
彈着小吉他輕輕的歌唱...
sang to his small guitar...

233
00:23:34,485 --> 00:23:39,092
你晚上冷嗎? 天轉涼了
Are you cold at night, now the weather's turned?

234
00:23:39,127 --> 00:23:43,700
要不要加塊毯子?      好的 謝謝
Would you like another blanket? Yes, please.

235
00:23:43,735 --> 00:23:45,620
你怎麼知道?
How did you know?

236
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:52,660
你小時候 保姆也會給你加塊毯子嗎?
Did your nurse bring you an extra blanket when you were a little girl?

237
00:23:52,695 --> 00:23:57,180
不會 所以我纔知道你想要一塊
No. But that's how I know you'd like one.

238
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:33,780
看 有條蟲子在拱
Look, there's a wiggly worm!

239
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:39,825
威廉 我們誰都聊到了 就是沒聊你
William, we have discussed everyone except you.

240
00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:44,300
你的生活越來越神祕了 我眞好奇
Your life is becoming quite shrouded in mystery and I am so curious.

241
00:24:44,335 --> 00:24:48,580
比如説 你給女兒找到家庭教師沒有?
Did you, for example, ever find a governess for your daughter?

242
00:24:48,615 --> 00:24:51,057
找到了 謝謝
Yes, I did, thank you.

243
00:24:51,092 --> 00:24:53,136
該不是被挽救的失足少女吧?
Not a rescue girl, I hope?

244
00:24:53,171 --> 00:24:55,145
爲什麼這麼想?
What makes you think that?

245
00:24:55,180 --> 00:24:58,340
福克斯太太在努力説服每個
Well, Mrs Fox is striving to convince anyone with the least

246
00:24:58,375 --> 00:25:01,460
缺僕人的人接納她的改造成果
servant problem to take one of her reformed specimens.

247
00:25:01,495 --> 00:25:03,452
她可不敢再找我了
She knows better than to approach me.

248
00:25:03,487 --> 00:25:05,375
我收了一個在廚房裏
I had a rescue girl in my kitchen,

249
00:25:05,410 --> 00:25:08,381
馬上就得開除了
was obliged to dismiss her very swiftly.

250
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:10,185
怎麼 出了什麼事?
Why? What happened?

251
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:12,580
體面人面前不好啓齒
Nothing I could discuss in polite company.

252
00:25:12,615 --> 00:25:14,865
我算體面人嗎?
Am I polite company?

253
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:18,305
哦 威廉 你可是自成一派
Oh, William. You are sui generis!

254
00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:21,945
我覺得和你什麼都能談
I feel as if I could discuss any subject with you.

255
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:25,780
它就是這樣 我説吧      蘇糖小姐 我又找到一個
Yes, he is, isn't he? Miss Sugar, I found another one.

256
00:25:25,815 --> 00:25:28,980
蘇糖小姐 你好嗎?
Miss Sugar, how do you do?

257
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:32,260
我很好 謝謝 先生
Very well, thank you, Sir.

258
00:25:32,295 --> 00:25:33,865
今天天氣不錯
A brighter day today.

259
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:37,740
對 對 所以我帶索菲到戸外上課
Yes, yes, it is. I brought Sophie outside for her lesson.

260
00:25:37,775 --> 00:25:41,580
她太蒼白了      淑女越蒼白越好
She's grown so pale. A lady can never be too pale.

261
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:45,060
可孩子需要新鮮空氣
But a child needs some air.

262
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:49,500
我發現索菲眞是個努力的孩子
I find Sophie such a hardworking little girl.

263
00:25:49,535 --> 00:25:51,380
那你太幸運了
How very agreeable for you.

264
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:55,300
很好 索菲
Very good, Sophie.

265
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:58,140
蘇糖小姐
Miss Sugar.

266
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:15,490
拉克曼先生 一會如果您有空
Mr Rackham? Might I have a word with you later,

267
00:26:15,525 --> 00:26:17,276
我能否跟您談談?
when you have a moment?

268
00:26:17,311 --> 00:26:18,580
當然可以
Of course.

269
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:25,025
那位女士是誰 索菲?
Who is that lady, Sophie?

270
00:26:25,060 --> 00:26:28,820
我不知道 小姐 可我見過她
I don't know, Miss. I've seen her before.

271
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:34,780
我父親誇我是個好孩子 小姐
My father says I was a good girl, Miss.

272
00:26:34,815 --> 00:26:38,140
他不是那麼説的
That's not what he said.

273
00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:03,820
你想見我
You wanted to see me?

274
00:27:05,780 --> 00:27:07,460
對
Yes!

275
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:15,025
我想你了
I miss you.

276
00:27:15,060 --> 00:27:17,385
今天看見你在花園裏
To see you in the garden today

277
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:21,300
卻不能碰你 眞是痛苦
and not be able to touch you was torture.

278
00:27:21,335 --> 00:27:24,585
眞的?
Really?

279
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:27,225
我太邋遢了
I feel so dowdy.

280
00:27:27,260 --> 00:27:29,905
我的好衣服都在箱子裏呢
All my good clothes are in the trunk.

281
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:33,260
照顧蘇菲不需要你原來的行頭
You don't need your old get-ups to take care of Sophie.

282
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:37,700
嗯 那倒是
No, of course not.

283
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:43,540
可我不想你對我膩味      膩味?
But I don't want you to grow bored of me. Bored?

284
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:48,403
蘇糖 你拯救了我
Sugar, you saved me!

285
00:27:48,438 --> 00:27:53,051
你不知道我在這房子裏感覺多陌生
You can't imagine how much of a stranger I felt in this house.

286
00:27:55,660 --> 00:27:57,290
可是你來了...
But then you arrived and...

287
00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:03,860
這是我們的家了
We have a home here.

288
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:08,060
正是
Exactly that.

289
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:12,540
我很感激
And I am grateful.

290
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:21,100
多感激?      感激不盡
How grateful? Very grateful.

291
00:28:21,135 --> 00:28:22,146
不過我得走了
But I must go now.

292
00:28:22,181 --> 00:28:25,421
波德利和阿什韋要發佈新書了
Bodley and Ashwell are launching their new book.

293
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:27,140
「社會至惡」
The Great Social Evil.

294
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:33,500
忙完了再來?
Perhaps later?

295
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:36,540
看吧
We'll see.

296
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:04,385
是誰?      蘇糖小姐 對不起
Who's there? Miss Sugar, I'm sorry!

297
00:29:04,420 --> 00:29:06,860
我...我在找拉克曼太太
I just, I need to check for Mrs Rackham.

298
00:29:09,820 --> 00:29:12,945
簡妮? 克拉拉?
Janey? Clara?

299
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:15,180
艾格尼絲 你在哪?
Agnes, where are you?

300
00:29:15,215 --> 00:29:17,625
艾格尼絲?
Agnes?

301
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:19,980
艾格尼絲 你在哪?
Agnes, where are you?

302
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:25,620
拉克曼太太
Mrs Rackham?

303
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:00,642
我的天使
My angel!

304
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:03,392
我就知道你會來的
I knew you'd come!

305
00:30:04,022 --> 00:30:06,170
艾格尼絲 你幹什麼了?
Agnes, what have you done?

306
00:30:06,205 --> 00:30:07,585
求你 我準備好了
Please, I'm ready.

307
00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:11,220
救我走      我...我不能
Get me away! I... I can't.

308
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:14,637
你是我唯一希望了
You're my only hope.

309
00:30:14,672 --> 00:30:17,104
我會救你的
I will help you.

310
00:30:17,139 --> 00:30:19,501
什麼時候      快了
When? Soon.

311
00:30:19,536 --> 00:30:23,416
你保證 你保證?
You promise? You promise?!

312
00:30:23,451 --> 00:30:27,340
對 可是首先我得告訴他們你很安全
Yes. But first I have to let them know you're safe.

313
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:31,065
安全?
Safe?

314
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:34,460
在這所房子裏 和他在一起?
In this house? With him?

315
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:43,820
別怕 艾格尼絲
Don't worry, Agnes.

316
00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:52,460
我在守望着你
I'm watching you.

317
00:30:55,580 --> 00:30:57,580
我能看見一切
I see everything.

318
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:01,740
別動
Stay still.

319
00:31:05,140 --> 00:31:06,940
拉克曼先生
Mr Rackham!

320
00:31:15,060 --> 00:31:16,969
我跟你説了幾個月了
I've been telling you for months,

321
00:31:17,004 --> 00:31:19,408
你妻子需要離開這裏 由專家治療
your wife requires specialist treatment away from this house.

322
00:31:19,443 --> 00:31:21,234
我就是要求你讓她快點痊癒
I am asking you to help hasten her recovery,

323
00:31:21,269 --> 00:31:23,246
就在這裏 她自己家裏
here, in her own home.

324
00:31:23,660 --> 00:31:26,168
沒人會指責丈夫因爲妻子摔斷腿
Nobody blames a man for sending his wife to hospital

325
00:31:26,203 --> 00:31:28,527
或染上天花就把她送進醫院
if she has a broken leg or contracts smallpox!

326
00:31:28,562 --> 00:31:31,100
這有什麼可比性
That is a facetious comparison.

327
00:31:33,420 --> 00:31:37,100
哦 拉克曼 別再自欺欺人
Oh, Rackham. You simply have to rid yourself of this notion

328
00:31:37,135 --> 00:31:38,739
以爲你妻子很健康
that your wife is a well person

329
00:31:38,774 --> 00:31:40,741
只是偶爾犯病
who suffers occasional bouts of illness.

330
00:31:40,776 --> 00:31:44,340
她已經重病纏身 只是偶爾會好一天
She is a very sick person who occasionally has a good day.

331
00:31:44,375 --> 00:31:45,618
她最近狀態非常好...
She's been doing marvellously well these...

332
00:31:45,653 --> 00:31:47,337
好什麼好
Of course she hasn't!

333
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:51,120
這可笑的鬧劇該收場了
Now, this absurd pantomime has gone too far.

334
00:31:51,155 --> 00:31:54,340
艾格尼絲是時候承認她是個母親了
It's high time Agnes admitted to being a mother.

335
00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:06,425
我對她無計可施了
She has me at my wits' end.

336
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:08,425
我中了什麼邪要叫科魯來啊
And why the hell did I ever call Curlew?!

337
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:11,566
好了 親愛的        他想把我妻子關進地獄
Hush, my love. He wants me to condemn my wife to a living hell

338
00:32:11,601 --> 00:32:13,191
就因爲她不會埋東西
because she can't use a spade.

339
00:32:13,226 --> 00:32:15,179
威廉 你冷靜點
William, you're beside yourself.

340
00:32:15,214 --> 00:32:17,206
今後她倒是不會找麻煩了
She'll be no trouble from now on, though. Oh, no.

341
00:32:17,241 --> 00:32:22,580
科魯總算有用了一回
Curlew has finally made himself useful in that respect.

342
00:32:22,615 --> 00:32:25,900
什麼意思?      要給她用鎭靜藥了
What do you mean? She's to be sedated.

343
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:29,425
整日整夜
Day and night.

344
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:32,580
這至於嗎?      我剛纔怎麼跟你説的?
Is that necessary? What have I just been telling you?!

345
00:32:32,615 --> 00:32:34,825
整日整夜
Day and night.

346
00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:36,380
你明白嗎?
Do you understand?!

347
00:32:48,420 --> 00:32:49,940
我的天使
My angel.

348
00:33:29,860 --> 00:33:32,813
傑西·夏普樂頓剛從桑吉巴回來
Jessie Sharpleton, just back from Zanzibar,

349
00:33:32,848 --> 00:33:34,922
還有克勞倫斯·弗里
and Clarence Ferry.

350
00:33:35,140 --> 00:33:37,828
噢 他是「她之墮落」的作者
Ah, he wrote Her Regrettable Lapse.

351
00:33:37,863 --> 00:33:39,722
我在赫馬基特見過這本書
I saw it at the Haymarket.

352
00:33:39,757 --> 00:33:45,001
我多麼喜愛和這些新時代的同行相聚
How I love to be surrounded by my denizens of the age to come.

353
00:33:45,036 --> 00:33:47,110
我説 拉克曼      沃森勳爵
I say, Rackham. Lord Watson.

354
00:33:47,145 --> 00:33:49,184
你小子夠忙的
You've been a busy chap.

355
00:33:49,340 --> 00:33:53,270
我在威尼斯的藥鋪裏都能看見你的臉
Even in the apothecaries in Venice I find your phiz,

356
00:33:53,305 --> 00:33:56,979
瓶瓶罐罐上全印着
stamped on all the little pots and bottles.

357
00:33:57,014 --> 00:33:58,745
摩登時代的奇蹟 先生
A miracle of the modern age, sir.

358
00:33:58,780 --> 00:34:01,374
我身在倫敦 就可以在巴黎
I can be making a fool of myself in Venice and

359
00:34:01,409 --> 00:34:03,817
和威尼斯傻名遠揚
Paris without ever leaving London!

360
00:34:03,852 --> 00:34:06,820
説的好
Very good!

361
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:27,585
克拉拉 拉克曼太太能坐起來眞是少見
Clara, I am surprised to see Mrs Rackham sitting up.

362
00:34:27,620 --> 00:34:31,180
我的疼痛減輕了 所以克拉拉減少了藥的劑量
Clara has decreased my medication now that I am in less pain.

363
00:34:31,215 --> 00:34:33,820
這不是克拉拉能決定的
That is not a decision for Clara.

364
00:34:33,855 --> 00:34:36,660
是我吩咐的
She was doing as I asked.

365
00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:42,185
我遭受了最大的羞辱
I have suffered a most humiliating rebuff.

366
00:34:42,220 --> 00:34:45,420
馬車伕説他被禁止載我去教堂
Cheeseman says he's forbidden to take me to church.

367
00:34:48,260 --> 00:34:49,940
親愛的 今天是星期五
My dear. It's Friday.

368
00:34:49,975 --> 00:34:52,985
我的教堂
My church.

369
00:34:53,020 --> 00:34:56,620
我需要奇蹟的治癒 威廉
I need a miracle of healing, William.

370
00:34:56,655 --> 00:34:59,357
可是艾格尼絲 你不能走動
But Agnes... Agnes, you cannot walk.

371
00:34:59,392 --> 00:35:02,060
馬伕可以背着我     別
Cheeseman can carry me. No.

372
00:35:05,260 --> 00:35:08,180
我不想讓你成爲笑柄
I will not have you become a laughing stock.

373
00:35:12,020 --> 00:35:17,060
你到底有多怯懦 多死板 威廉
What a cowardly, conventional man you are, William.

374
00:35:17,095 --> 00:35:18,580
艾格尼絲 你生病了
Agnes, you are ill.

375
00:35:20,340 --> 00:35:22,345
我是爲了照顧你
I'm trying to take care of you.

376
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:25,020
你什麼時候照顧了我?
When have you ever taken care of me?

377
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:32,540
什麼時候?!
When? When?!

378
00:35:32,575 --> 00:35:35,497
艾格尼斯 別
Agnes, no!

379
00:35:35,532 --> 00:35:38,385
別 艾格尼斯...
No, Agnes...

380
00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:40,460
別在僕人面前這樣!
Agnes, not in front of the servant!

381
00:35:40,495 --> 00:35:43,700
艾格尼絲 停下
Agnes! Stop it!

382
00:35:43,735 --> 00:35:45,705
艾格尼絲
Agnes!

383
00:35:45,740 --> 00:35:49,646
我的身體快變成行屍走肉了
My body is turning into raw meat and

384
00:35:49,681 --> 00:35:52,610
而你卻只在乎別人怎麼想
all you care about is what other people think!

385
00:35:52,645 --> 00:35:54,980
艾格尼絲 看在上帝份上!     拉克曼太太 求你了!
Agnes, for pity's sake! Mrs Rackham, please!

386
00:35:55,015 --> 00:35:56,500
停下來 停下來!
Stop it, stop it!

387
00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:01,900
你弄痛我了
You're hurting me.

388
00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:06,380
找別人玩吧
Go play with someone else.

389
00:37:02,355 --> 00:37:09,789
(親愛的科魯醫生 您最近...)
dear dr. curlew, how...

390
00:37:31,740 --> 00:37:33,345
索菲
Sophie.

391
00:37:33,380 --> 00:37:35,780
看到你下樓眞好
How nice it is to see you downstairs.

392
00:37:46,060 --> 00:37:48,740
你的媽媽在哪 小姐?
Where is your mama, Miss?

393
00:37:48,775 --> 00:37:51,420
她在家 自己的房子裏
She's at home, in her house.

394
00:37:54,260 --> 00:37:56,720
一個人嗎?     不
All alone? No.

395
00:37:56,755 --> 00:37:59,180
有人會來看她
She has visitors.

396
00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:04,060
下一張卡是爲她做的
The next card I make is for her.

397
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:08,220
很期待 索菲
We'll see, Sophie.

398
00:38:13,820 --> 00:38:15,980
上個聖誕節 你在照顧誰?
Who were you looking after last Christmas?

399
00:38:17,780 --> 00:38:20,540
一個小男孩 克里斯托弗
A little boy, Christopher.

400
00:38:22,820 --> 00:38:24,460
現在誰照顧他?
Who's looking after him now?

401
00:38:28,780 --> 00:38:30,300
不知道
I don't know.

402
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:33,580
總可以再給他做張卡吧?
Surely we should make him a card?

403
00:38:40,820 --> 00:38:45,260
聖誕快樂 所有人
Merry Christmas, one and all!

404
00:38:46,220 --> 00:38:47,620
艾格尼絲呢?
Where's Agnes?

405
00:38:49,140 --> 00:38:51,185
樓上 睡着呢
Upstairs, sleeping.

406
00:38:51,220 --> 00:38:54,340
噢 用鎭定劑了吧 這樣最好
Ah, doped up. Better for everybody.

407
00:38:54,375 --> 00:38:57,145
這我不好説
I don't know about that,

408
00:38:57,180 --> 00:39:00,740
可是索菲可以第一次加入我們了
but it does mean that Sophie can join us for the first time.

409
00:39:02,980 --> 00:39:07,260
看看孩子都長這麼大了!
Will you look at the size of the child!

410
00:39:07,295 --> 00:39:10,625
哈哈!

411
00:39:10,660 --> 00:39:13,980
現在告訴我 禮物在哪裏?

Oh, Miss Sugar. No, no. Er, Sophie...

416
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:51,380
請讓我來
Please, allow me.

417
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:57,220
拉克曼先生 你眞是善良仁厚
Erm, Mr Rackham, that's very generous.

418
00:40:05,340 --> 00:40:08,340
是書嗎 小姐?     是的 索菲
Books, Miss? Yes, Sophie.

你父親和我的共同愛好
Your father and I share a passion.

421
00:40:13,615 --> 00:40:15,705
索菲小姐
Miss Sophie.

422
00:40:15,740 --> 00:40:20,157
這個珍貴的儀器來自於我
This is a precision instrument entrusted to me

423
00:40:20,192 --> 00:40:22,613
曾經遇到的一位探險家
by an explorer I once met.

424
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:27,665
讓我來告訴你它的用法
Let me show you how it works.

425
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:31,060
你把這個取下來 從這邊看過去
You take this off, look through the window.

426
00:40:37,780 --> 00:40:42,620
讓我來 索菲
Allow me, Sophie.

427
00:40:45,540 --> 00:40:46,940
嘴張開!
Open up!

428
00:41:18,860 --> 00:41:20,545
小姐?     嗯?
Miss? Hmm?

429
00:41:20,580 --> 00:41:23,220
我長大後 能當探險家嗎?
Do you think I could be an explorer when I'm older?

430
00:41:24,740 --> 00:41:26,260
爲什麼不能呢
I don't see why not.

431
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:31,780
也許這不合規矩 女性探險家
It mightn't be permitted, a lady explorer.

432
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:35,985
現在是摩登時代了 索菲
These are modern times, Sophie.

433
00:41:36,020 --> 00:41:38,260
女人現在什麼都能做
Women can do all sorts of things nowadays.

434
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:48,005
也許我能去那些 男士探險家們
Perhaps I could explore the places the gentlemen explorers

435
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:49,981
不想去的地方
just don't wish to explore.

436
00:41:51,820 --> 00:41:53,300
也許你可以的
Perhaps you could.

437
00:41:56,060 --> 00:41:59,940
現在叫醒媽媽也沒用了
There's no use anyone waking my mama now,

438
00:41:59,975 --> 00:42:02,065
是嗎 小姐?
is there, Miss?

439
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:04,620
她錯過了一切
She has missed everything.

440
00:42:04,655 --> 00:42:07,140
她病的很嚴重 索菲
She is very ill, Sophie.

441
00:42:09,700 --> 00:42:12,540
我想她很快會死掉 然後被他們埋進土裏
I think she'll die soon and they'll put her in the ground.

442
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:20,185
如果你願意的話
If you like,

443
00:42:20,220 --> 00:42:22,740
我們可以一起讀讀明天要給你的書
we can read the book I gave you tomorrow.

444
00:42:26,300 --> 00:42:29,180
好的 我願意
Yes. Yes, I'd like that.

445
00:42:32,940 --> 00:42:35,105
晚安 蘇糖小姐
Goodnight, Miss Sugar.

446
00:42:35,140 --> 00:42:38,540
上帝保佑你      你也是 索菲
And God bless. You too, Sophie.

447
00:43:09,780 --> 00:43:11,100

第一次的晚上我不是故意弄疼你的

我是太着急了 忘乎所以
I was made hasty by urgency.

462
00:45:03,775 --> 00:45:05,260
我以爲...

好像不需要叫我來

不要 離我遠一點
No. No. Get away from me.

531
00:53:35,340 --> 00:53:37,305
你不是説眞的吧
You don't mean that.

532
00:53:37,340 --> 00:53:40,380
讓我一個人呆着!

'The right destination will reveal itself to you.

542
00:56:25,935 --> 00:56:29,460
你所選即是目的地
'The place you choose will be the right place

543
00:56:29,495 --> 00:56:31,828
因爲是你選擇了它
because you chose it. '

544
00:56:32,980 --> 00:56:34,500
洛斯特威西爾 (康沃爾郡 英國西南)
Lostwithiel

545
00:56:47,300 --> 00:56:49,065
蘇糖小姐?
Miss Sugar?

546
00:56:49,100 --> 00:56:51,740
我眞的不知道她去了哪裏
I really have no idea where she could have gone.

547
00:56:51,775 --> 00:56:54,380
我眞的很難相信 拉克曼太太
I find it very hard to believe that Mrs Rackham

548
00:56:54,415 --> 00:56:56,295
能夠逃出這裏
could have made her way out into the world

549
00:56:56,330 --> 00:56:58,133
不是有人幫她
without the help of someone.

550
00:56:58,168 --> 00:57:00,782
女人可以做出很多不可思議的事
It is remarkable what a woman can do

551
00:57:00,817 --> 00:57:02,622
如果用盡她全副心智的話
when she sets her mind to it.

552
00:57:02,700 --> 00:57:05,025
她根本沒有全副心智
What's left of her mind.

553
00:57:05,060 --> 00:57:06,502
這對拉克曼先生一定是很嚴重的打擊
This will be such a blow for Mr Rackham.

554
00:57:06,537 --> 00:57:11,901
希望拉克曼太太會在他之前回來
I do hope Mrs Rackham returns before he does.

555
00:57:12,580 --> 00:57:14,100
是啊
Indeed.

556
00:57:17,380 --> 00:57:21,980
拉克曼太太身體極度虛弱
Mrs Rackham is an extremely vulnerable individual.

557
00:57:22,015 --> 00:57:24,100
如果有人幫助過她...
And if someone has helped her...

558
00:57:25,500 --> 00:57:27,540
這就等同於謀殺
.. well, that's tantamount to murder.

559
00:57:32,820 --> 00:57:34,857
當你到達目的地
'When you arrive at your destination,

560
00:57:34,892 --> 00:57:38,076
走進郷邨裏
'walk deep into the countryside.

561
00:57:38,111 --> 00:57:41,260
問修院的路怎麼走
'Ask to be shown to the convent.

562
00:57:47,500 --> 00:57:49,460
永不放棄
'Don't take no for an answer.

563
00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:52,440
答應我
'Promise. '

564
00:58:32,093 --> 00:58:35,095
