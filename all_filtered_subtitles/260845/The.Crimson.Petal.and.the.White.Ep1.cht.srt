5
00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:35,132
倫敦 1874年
London, 1874.

6
00:00:36,341 --> 00:00:37,907
放機靈點
Keep your wits about you.

7
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:42,388
這座城市很大 錯綜複雜
This city is vast, and intricate,

8
00:00:43,146 --> 00:00:45,739
你根本不知道這裏有什麼
and you do not know your way around.

9
00:01:10,496 --> 00:01:13,397
想起從前讀過的故事 你可能覺得
You imagine, from other stories you've read,

10
00:01:13,635 --> 00:01:14,780
你很瞭解這裏
that you know it well.

11
00:01:18,343 --> 00:01:20,381
可它們故意迎合了你
But those stories flattered you.

12
00:01:20,903 --> 00:01:25,429
你是個異類 從另一個時空陡然闖入
You are an alien from another time and place altogether.

13
00:01:26,215 --> 00:01:28,875
你連現在幾點都不知道 對嗎?
You don't even know what hour it is, do you?

14
00:01:29,495 --> 00:01:31,486
這裏大多數人也不知道
Nor do most where you're going.

15
00:01:34,755 --> 00:01:38,179
他們的就寢時間依琴酒的酒力決定
Here people go to sleep as soon as the gin takes effect.

16
00:01:40,667 --> 00:01:43,216
你會任憑自己被引入迷途
You've allowed yourself to be led astray

17
00:01:43,945 --> 00:01:47,576
再也不用指望找到來路
and there's no hope of finding your way back.

18
00:03:00,664 --> 00:03:03,120
伊麗莎白 我帶蠟燭來了
Elizabeth? I brought candles.

19
00:03:03,964 --> 00:03:07,097
用不着 我沒什麼好看的
I won't need 'em. I'm not a pretty sight.

20
00:03:15,495 --> 00:03:18,007
你看起來挺好      老天 蘇糖
You look all right.        Christ, Sugar.

21
00:03:19,717 --> 00:03:21,405
你還會臉紅不會?
Don't you never blush?

22
00:03:23,882 --> 00:03:25,183
怎麼回事?
What happened?

23
00:03:25,634 --> 00:03:26,932
兩個人
Two of 'em.

24
00:03:28,606 --> 00:03:30,258
不肯跟我回這邊
Wouldn't walk all the way back here.

25
00:03:31,994 --> 00:03:34,433
「就在黑巷子裏野戰如何?」
"How about a quick soot-arse in the alley?"

26
00:03:36,253 --> 00:03:37,566
他們一直狂笑
Never stopped laughing.

27
00:03:38,655 --> 00:03:43,136
我會追到天涯海角 殺了他們      那還用説
I'm going to hunt them down and kill them.        Course you are.

28
00:03:44,156 --> 00:03:46,736
你對欺負過你的人都是這樣
Like all the ones who ever done you mischief.

29
00:03:54,171 --> 00:03:56,291
明天我就是一具臭皮囊了
Tomorrow I'll be cold meat.

30
00:03:57,824 --> 00:03:59,982
他們會把我扔到河裏      他們不會的
They'll toss me in the river.        They won't.

31
00:04:00,737 --> 00:04:01,866
我不讓他們這麼做
I won't let them.

32
00:04:02,889 --> 00:04:04,901
鰻魚會啃光我的眼珠
Eels will eat out my eyes.

33
00:04:07,258 --> 00:04:09,057
誰也不會記得有我這個人
No-one'll know I ever lived.

34
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:12,566
我記得
I'll know.

35
00:04:31,181 --> 00:04:34,497
又是你 這回又來拯救誰來啦?
You again? Who have you come to rescue now?

36
00:04:34,498 --> 00:04:36,820
我給伊麗莎白送牛蹄凍來的
I brought Elizabeth some calf's-foot jelly.

37
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:38,568
晚了
Too late.

38
00:04:39,952 --> 00:04:40,887
她死了
She's dead.

39
00:05:17,878 --> 00:05:20,726
飛 快飛 飛啊
Fly... Fly now...Fly!

40
00:05:25,749 --> 00:05:28,792
是我帽子上的 她襲擊我 用...
It's from my hat. She struck at me with...

41
00:05:29,442 --> 00:05:31,405
科魯? 去請科魯醫生了
Curlew? Doctor Curlew's been sent for.

42
00:05:34,339 --> 00:05:37,017
親愛的福克斯太太 請這邊走
My dear Mrs Fox, please, this way.

43
00:05:37,708 --> 00:05:39,749
是我該道歉纔對
It is we who must apologise.

44
00:05:40,003 --> 00:05:41,590
宴會提前結束了
The party ended prematurely.

45
00:05:42,665 --> 00:05:45,595
恐怕是我弟妹讓它戛然而止的
I'm afraid my sister-in-law brought it to a halt with a most

46
00:05:45,856 --> 00:05:47,548
以最不幸的方式
unfortunate turn.

47
00:05:47,548 --> 00:05:48,929
可憐的艾格尼絲
poor Agnes.

48
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:53,414
我想我還是...送您回家吧
I think it best for me to... see you home.

49
00:05:58,713 --> 00:06:00,112
對不起 威廉
I'm sorry, William.

50
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:04,350
對不起 對不起 對不起
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

51
00:06:04,351 --> 00:06:05,415
不用這樣
No need for that.

52
00:06:10,475 --> 00:06:12,066
我還是你的小女孩嗎?
Am I still your little girl?

53
00:06:14,123 --> 00:06:15,079
是
Yes...

54
00:06:16,102 --> 00:06:17,373
你當然是
Of course you are!

55
00:06:20,358 --> 00:06:21,424
永遠都是
Always.

56
00:06:31,329 --> 00:06:33,768
別碰我      哦
Don't touch me.        No.

57
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:37,968
好 不碰你
No, of course not.

58
00:06:49,029 --> 00:06:51,370
您知道 艾格尼絲很脆弱的
You know very well Agnes is delicate.

59
00:06:51,799 --> 00:06:55,509
我們這麼窘迫 她壓力更大
Our current financial woes place an intolerable strain on her nerves.

60
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:57,751
難怪會發生這種小事故...
It's hardly surprising that little incidents like this...

61
00:06:57,752 --> 00:06:59,881
小事故?
Little incidents?!

62
00:07:00,038 --> 00:07:04,690
她用壁爐釬子敲掉了一個女士的帽子
She knocked a woman's hat clean off her head with a poker!

63
00:07:06,458 --> 00:07:08,565
要是把人家眼睛戳了呢
She could have had her eye out!

64
00:07:09,222 --> 00:07:11,693
她説她突然覺得憋悶
She felt trapped, she said.

65
00:07:12,344 --> 00:07:14,476
然後就一眼看到
Next thing she caught sight of

66
00:07:14,477 --> 00:07:16,927
布利德樓夫人帽子上的小鳥標本
the stuffed bird on Lady Bridgelow's bonnet

67
00:07:16,928 --> 00:07:18,747
以爲它要展翅飛走
and believed it was about to take wing.

68
00:07:18,748 --> 00:07:21,530
她只想幫它掙脱羅網
She sought only to free it from its yards of net.

69
00:07:21,531 --> 00:07:23,137
你聽聽這都什麼話?
Can you hear yourself?

70
00:07:23,138 --> 00:07:25,767
當然 這種衝動不對
An erroneous impulse, certainly...

71
00:07:27,495 --> 00:07:29,280
不過精神可嘉吧
..but a generous one at least,

72
00:07:30,453 --> 00:07:33,202
再説我們的經濟狀況這麼...
and given our current financial circumstances...

73
00:07:33,203 --> 00:07:35,346
你要是眞想改善改善
If you want your circumstances to change,

74
00:07:35,347 --> 00:07:36,860
該怎麼做你心裏有數
you know what you have to do.

75
00:07:37,365 --> 00:07:39,326
心思放到生意上來
Turn your mind to the business!

76
00:07:39,327 --> 00:07:41,412
今年的賬本我都給你一個月了
I gave you this year's accounts a month ago,

77
00:07:41,413 --> 00:07:44,231
你看過沒? 一眼都沒有      我試過了
have you looked at them? No!        I have tried!

78
00:07:44,774 --> 00:07:46,732
我天生就不是生意人
I do not have a flair for business!

79
00:07:46,733 --> 00:07:48,369
我不像您
I am not like you!

80
00:07:49,508 --> 00:07:50,736
我是個作家
I'm a writer!

81
00:07:52,689 --> 00:07:53,990
你有作品嗎?
What have you written?

82
00:07:55,717 --> 00:07:57,043
一本小冊子
A small pamphlet.

83
00:07:58,841 --> 00:08:00,369
還沒出版
Not yet published.

84
00:08:00,370 --> 00:08:01,637
老天爺
Dear God.

85
00:08:01,872 --> 00:08:05,819
父親 只要您賣掉拉克漢香水廠...      賣掉?
Father, if you were only to sell Rackham's        Sell?

86
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:07,787
投資到這邊來
..and invest the proceeds,

87
00:08:07,788 --> 00:08:10,271
賺的錢會讓我們都衣食無憂的
we could all live quite comfortably off the interest!

88
00:08:11,767 --> 00:08:13,745
你的年金還得減
Your allowance was somewhat reduced.

89
00:08:13,746 --> 00:08:16,631
你就當它全取消了吧
You may now consider it altogether withdrawn.

90
00:08:16,632 --> 00:08:18,982
去吧 隨你幹什麼
You go ahead, you be your own man.

91
00:08:19,355 --> 00:08:21,175
自己養活自己吧
At your own expense!

92
00:08:23,021 --> 00:08:25,382
可是 父親      吃你的筆桿子去吧
But, sir        Write your way out of that!

93
00:08:25,383 --> 00:08:28,260
父親...父親?
Sir...Sir?

94
00:08:37,771 --> 00:08:42,356
怎麼就不勞那酒商大駕親自送來呢?
Why, pray, was the vintner unable to make this delivery in person?

95
00:08:42,966 --> 00:08:44,356
憑什麼我
How did it come to pass

96
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:47,729
還要派你去取酒呢 克里斯托弗?
that I had to ask you to collect the claret, Christopher?

97
00:08:48,189 --> 00:08:51,197
他説「告訴卡特韋夫人 因爲聖誕節到啦」
He says, "Tell Mrs Castaway it's cos of Christmas."

98
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:53,757
聖誕節
Christmas!

99
00:08:54,599 --> 00:08:56,024
什麼叫聖誕節呀?
What is Christmas?

100
00:08:56,025 --> 00:08:58,009
就是耶穌出生的日子
It's the day Jesus was born.

101
00:08:58,010 --> 00:09:00,839
耶穌是誰?      他爲贖我們的罪而死
Who's Jesus?        He died for our sins.

102
00:09:02,259 --> 00:09:05,522
看來是白費了 我們這不還贖着嘛
Evidently unsuccessfully, since we're all still paying.

103
00:09:07,676 --> 00:09:11,236
男人噴出一股黏液
One squirt of slime from the man,

104
00:09:12,376 --> 00:09:14,703
女人一顆腥臭的卵子
one fishy egg in the woman,

105
00:09:15,896 --> 00:09:17,145
瞧呀
and behold -

106
00:09:18,378 --> 00:09:22,582
他們就稱他...以馬內利 (耶穌的別名)
they shall call his name...Emmanuel.

107
00:09:26,051 --> 00:09:27,547
給你帶熊油了
Got some bear's grease for ya.

108
00:09:28,934 --> 00:09:29,936
謝謝 克里斯托弗
Thank you, Christopher.

109
00:09:33,254 --> 00:09:36,704
就你自己? 沒帶位先生?
All alone, is it? No gent in tow?

110
00:09:38,261 --> 00:09:39,638
伊麗莎白死了
Elizabeth is dead.

111
00:09:41,243 --> 00:09:42,931
享清福去嘍
Gone to a better place.

112
00:09:44,101 --> 00:09:45,721
她總説她要去好地方 對吧?
Always said she would, didn't she?

113
00:09:55,742 --> 00:09:56,917
下一個是誰?
Who's next?

114
00:09:57,417 --> 00:09:58,359
你?
You?

115
00:09:58,938 --> 00:09:59,910
我?
Me?

116
00:10:00,867 --> 00:10:03,187
記得今後胸衣裏帶把刀子
Be sure and carry a knife in your bodice from now on.

117
00:10:03,188 --> 00:10:04,890
我肯定想不到用它的
I'd never have the wit to use it.

118
00:10:05,777 --> 00:10:07,266
當心裙子
Watch your dress.

119
00:10:07,884 --> 00:10:09,077
可別弄髒了
You don't want to spoil it.

120
00:10:09,605 --> 00:10:12,181
爲這穿不了五分鐘的衣服 費的工夫可不小
A lot of trouble you go to for clothes that only stay on five minutes.

121
00:10:12,182 --> 00:10:13,171
打擾一下 女士們
Excuse me, ladies.

122
00:10:13,697 --> 00:10:16,580
我能有幸永遠留存你們的倩影嗎?
I would be honoured to preserve your image for all time!

123
00:10:16,581 --> 00:10:17,669
永遠留存?
For all time?

124
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:19,659
不用了 謝謝      試試也無妨啊
No, thank you.        Go on. Why not?

125
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:21,572
我可不想千秋萬世
I'd rather not spend an indefinite future

126
00:10:21,573 --> 00:10:23,820
被陌生人傳來傳去
being passed from hand to hand by strangers.

127
00:10:24,702 --> 00:10:27,196
我倒不介意永遠被人記住
Wouldn't have minded being remembered for eternity, that's all.

128
00:10:32,136 --> 00:10:33,936
伊麗莎白請我把她寫進我的書裏
Elizabeth asked me to put her in my book.

129
00:10:34,781 --> 00:10:36,133
大概她也是這麼想的
Thinking the same, I suppose.

130
00:10:39,862 --> 00:10:41,997
我原來最喜歡聽你讀你的書
I used to love it when you read your book to us.

131
00:10:44,664 --> 00:10:45,700
可是我覺得...
But I wondered...

132
00:10:46,846 --> 00:10:49,365
你有沒有想過寫點喜慶事進去呢
whether you ever thought of putting a bit of good fortune in.

133
00:10:50,187 --> 00:10:51,778
比如從天而降的救星
Like a miraculous rescue!

134
00:10:53,717 --> 00:10:54,500
沒有
No.

135
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:56,755
這是本仇恨的書 卡迪
It's a book of hate, Caddie,

136
00:10:57,328 --> 00:11:00,111
用來報復每個外強中乾的
to wreak revenge on every pompous trembling worm

137
00:11:00,112 --> 00:11:02,042
爬上卡特韋夫人門檻的小爬蟲
who taps at Mrs Castaway's door!

138
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:18,349
比爾
BILL!

139
00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:20,510
波德利，阿什韋
Bodley, Ashwell.

140
00:11:20,965 --> 00:11:23,084
你頭髮遭什麼殃啦?
What HAS happened to your hair?

141
00:11:23,442 --> 00:11:27,527
啊 這個...是照馬修·阿諾德 (19世紀英國詩人 評論家) 剪的
Ah, it... It was supposed to look like Matthew Arnold.

142
00:11:28,003 --> 00:11:29,586
剪得不像我挺高興的
I'm actually pleased it doesn't,

143
00:11:29,587 --> 00:11:31,949
我覺得他的新作有點被吹捧過頭了
I...I think his latest work to be overrated.

144
00:11:33,085 --> 00:11:35,847
來吧 老夥計 去喝一杯
Come on, old chap, let's get you a drink.

145
00:11:42,951 --> 00:11:47,100
我們爲鑽研這本書可絞盡了腦汁了
So, we're quite worn out by the research for this book.

146
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:49,439
那你們想出名字了嗎?
And, do you have a title yet?

147
00:11:51,262 --> 00:11:52,524
「禱告的效力」
The Efficacy of Prayer.

148
00:11:58,841 --> 00:12:00,478
反諷的      對
It's ironic.        Yes.

149
00:12:01,934 --> 00:12:04,052
有希望找到一家出版商嗎?
Is there any hope of finding a publisher for such a piece?

150
00:12:04,053 --> 00:12:05,583
這年頭 總有雷霆般的呼聲在要求
There's a thundering call these days for books

151
00:12:05,584 --> 00:12:09,309
那種打破社會結構的書 説到這個...
that destroy the fabric of society. Speaking of which...

152
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:11,756
你那部大作如何了?
how goes the great work?

153
00:12:12,488 --> 00:12:13,718
按部就班的推進中
At its own pace.

154
00:12:15,285 --> 00:12:16,056
好吧
Well...

155
00:12:17,067 --> 00:12:18,797
也別全撲在書上
don't let the book consume you entirely.

156
00:12:19,263 --> 00:12:23,126
近來你都成了隱士了 大好機會都喪失了
You're a virtual recluse these days, and such opportunities lost!

157
00:12:23,421 --> 00:12:24,602
機會?
Opportunities?

158
00:12:26,998 --> 00:12:30,458
露西·菲茨羅伊 纔14歳      哦
Lucy Fitzroy. Only 14.        Oh!

159
00:12:30,783 --> 00:12:33,318
在喬吉娜夫人手下 使得一手好鞭子
Wields a vicious whip at Madame Georgina's.

160
00:12:33,607 --> 00:12:35,117
好個小騷貨
An absolute fizgig!

161
00:12:35,118 --> 00:12:38,401
不過我們眞正朝思暮想的是蘇糖
But the one we're just dying to have a crack at is Sugar.

162
00:12:38,830 --> 00:12:41,579
蘇糖?      卡特韋夫人家的
Sugar?        Over at Mrs Castaway's,

163
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:43,113
那可是高級去處
a very high-class house.

164
00:12:43,114 --> 00:12:44,432
當然 怎麼也吃不到口
Of course, one can never get her.

165
00:12:44,433 --> 00:12:46,061
我都開始懷疑有沒有她這個人了
I begin to wonder if she even exists.

166
00:12:46,062 --> 00:12:47,914
聲名遠播 十分誘人
The most intriguing reputation.

167
00:12:48,817 --> 00:12:51,163
傳説她從不讓人失望
They say she never disappoints.

168
00:12:55,368 --> 00:12:57,359
這總讓你文思泉涌了吧
That'd put ink in your nib, now.

169
00:13:13,694 --> 00:13:16,653
門鈴這東西就不該讓人按兩次
It should never be necessary to ring a doorbell more than once...

170
00:13:19,068 --> 00:13:21,333
...尤其是在...自己家裏
..especially if it is... one's own...

171
00:13:22,512 --> 00:13:23,321
萊蒂
Letty.

172
00:13:26,288 --> 00:13:29,382
拉克漢夫人還好嗎?      還好 先生
How is Mrs Rackham?        Well, sir, I believe.

173
00:13:30,052 --> 00:13:31,658
科魯醫生和她在一起
Doctor Curlew is with her.

174
00:13:33,689 --> 00:13:34,702
拉克漢先生?
Mr Rackham?

175
00:13:35,564 --> 00:13:37,105
家裏沒有煤了
We're short on coal.

176
00:13:37,362 --> 00:13:39,128
一直沒人送來
The delivery never arrived.

177
00:13:39,702 --> 00:13:41,105
我換了一家煤鋪
I've changed supplier.

178
00:13:42,759 --> 00:13:44,851
原來那家越來越靠不住了
Our fellow was becoming quite erratic.

179
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:58,335
(里德煤鐵公司 賬單 共15鎊)

180
00:14:02,418 --> 00:14:06,599
(科魯醫生 賬單 10鎊)

181
00:14:28,718 --> 00:14:29,677
拉克漢先生?
Mr Rackham?

182
00:14:32,828 --> 00:14:33,577
科魯
Curlew.

183
00:14:36,965 --> 00:14:37,870
請坐吧
Please.

184
00:14:38,971 --> 00:14:40,844
眼下 她還挺清醒的
Well, she's tolerably lucid,

185
00:14:41,172 --> 00:14:43,849
可我預料她很快就會崩潰
but I expect a full collapse very shortly.

186
00:14:45,974 --> 00:14:46,923
是嗎?
Really?

187
00:14:49,671 --> 00:14:52,240
我還覺得她好轉了呢
I had been thinking she seemed rather better.

188
00:14:52,241 --> 00:14:53,418
那你就上當了
Then you're deluded.

189
00:14:53,704 --> 00:14:55,615
拉克漢 每次我拜訪她
Rackham, every time I visit her,

190
00:14:56,033 --> 00:14:58,997
她都要費很大自制力鎭定下來
she has to fight that much more strenuously to compose herself.

191
00:15:00,155 --> 00:15:02,331
她對您的來訪壓力很大
She finds your visits very stressful.

192
00:15:05,341 --> 00:15:07,461
也許我...      我很理解
Perhaps I...        I do understand

193
00:15:07,462 --> 00:15:09,175
讓艾格尼絲暫時入院...
that having Agnes temporarily committed...

194
00:15:09,176 --> 00:15:09,657
入院
Committed!

195
00:15:09,658 --> 00:15:12,129
會使您痛苦 以及名譽受損
..would cause you personal pain and social embarrassment.

196
00:15:12,130 --> 00:15:15,481
可我也見過別的人糾結於這個決定
But I have seen other men wrestle with the same decision and,

197
00:15:15,482 --> 00:15:18,580
相信我 他們一旦下定了決心
believe me, once they have made it,

198
00:15:18,581 --> 00:15:20,598
個個都如釋重負
they are relieved beyond words.

How do I look, Clara?

208
00:17:31,889 --> 00:17:32,862
眞美
Beautiful.

209
00:17:35,541 --> 00:17:38,790
醫生説...我不能再讀書了
The doctor... says I'm not to read any more.

210
00:17:38,791 --> 00:17:40,567
他説那...會刺激我
He...he says it excites me.

211
00:17:40,568 --> 00:17:42,536
他也不是什麼都懂      對
Well, he doesn't know everything.        No.

212
00:18:29,863 --> 00:18:34,115
(救命)
help

213
00:19:35,939 --> 00:19:38,309
你眞是個淘氣的孩子!
You've been a very naughty boy!

214
00:19:53,379 --> 00:19:55,649
你還沒告訴我們你是幹什麼的呢
So, you never told us what it is you do,

215
00:19:55,650 --> 00:19:58,160
做什麼生意的?      生意
what line of business?        Business?

216
00:19:58,161 --> 00:19:59,915
這個詞我提都懶得提
There's a word I've no time for!

217
00:20:00,749 --> 00:20:02,702
不 我是個作家
No, I am a writer,

218
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:04,985
小説家 評論家
novelist, critic.

219
00:20:04,986 --> 00:20:07,241
你叫什麼?      沒準我聽過你呢
What's your name?        I might've heard of you.

220
00:20:07,641 --> 00:20:08,891
我估計不會
I very much doubt that.

221
00:20:09,623 --> 00:20:12,881
你們幾位女士 恕我直言 不像讀書人
You ladies don't, if you'll excuse me, look like readers.

222
00:20:13,390 --> 00:20:15,078
別看不起人了
I know more than you might expect.

223
00:20:15,366 --> 00:20:17,441
我可試過狄更斯的      他早掛了吧?
I've had Charles Dickens.        Ain't he dead?

224

那是誰?

00:20:32,504 --> 00:20:33,934
那不是你在等的人嗎?
Is that who you're waiting for?

227
00:20:33,984 --> 00:20:35,671
他和這裏一半傻瓜都在等
Him and half the fools in 'ere.

228
00:20:36,358 --> 00:20:39,504
嘿 蘇糖      他説他是作家
Hey, Sugar!        Writer, he says!

229
00:20:39,611 --> 00:20:41,154
在等你呢

有個H的
With an aitch.

234
00:21:00,729 --> 00:21:02,176
呃 喬治·亨特
Er, George Hunt.

235
00:21:02,643 --> 00:21:03,477
你是...
And you are...?

236
00:21:03,863 --> 00:21:06,124
蘇糖就是我的姓名 亨特先生
Sugar is all there is to my name, Mr Hunt.

237
00:21:07,270 --> 00:21:08,193
蘇糖
Sugar.

238
00:21:14,051 --> 00:21:16,299
希望您沒有等很久 和這三女巫
I do hope you haven't been waiting too long with the Three Witches

239
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:17,294
在一起
for company.

240
00:21:18,054 --> 00:21:21,001
三女巫...這是馬克白裏的
The Three Witc... That's Macbeth.

241
00:21:22,009 --> 00:21:23,211
請原諒我的儀容
You must forgive my appearance.

242
00:21:23,212 --> 00:21:25,282
這惡劣天氣把我的頭髮全給糟蹋了
This foul weather plays havoc with my hair.

243
00:21:25,283 --> 00:21:26,566
我的也是
Oh, mine too!

244
00:21:27,882 --> 00:21:31,596
我專門照着馬修·阿諾德剪的
I had it cut. It was supposed to look like Matthew Arnold.

245
00:21:35,083 --> 00:21:37,422
剪得不像      慶幸吧
It doesn't.        Be thankful.

246
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:39,453
我覺得他有點被吹捧過頭了
I think he's rather overrated,

247
00:21:41,002 --> 00:21:43,045
不過您當然比我明智
but I'm sure you know much better than I.

248
00:21:43,046 --> 00:21:44,858
不 我同意
No! I agree.

249
00:21:45,739 --> 00:21:46,806
那還用説
Absolutely.

250
00:21:47,651 --> 00:21:49,043
怎麼也比不上拉斯金 (19世紀英國藝術評論家)
Give me Ruskin, any day!

251
00:21:49,643 --> 00:21:51,492
如果您説的是拉斯金先生的散文
If it is Mr Ruskin's prose you're referring to,

252
00:21:51,493 --> 00:21:52,951
那我完全同意
then I quite concur.

253
00:21:53,448 --> 00:21:55,025
他的詩就免了
Spare me his poetry.

254
00:21:55,422 --> 00:21:57,075
他的韻律確實乏善可陳
In verse he's a major minor.

255
00:22:04,564 --> 00:22:07,701
丁尼生的新作 多麼奇妙
Tennyson's latest work, pure whimsy.

256

多麼奇妙 簡直...異想天開
It's whimsy, it's whi...whimsical.

It's... There is a poet, James Thompson.

258
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:15,639
詹姆斯·湯普森?
James Thompson?

259
00:22:16,108 --> 00:22:20,839
對 詹姆斯·湯普森 他最新的作品
Yes, James Thompson, who in his latest work

260
00:22:21,542 --> 00:22:24,389
眞是...翻天覆地

It has no purpose, heart, nor mind,

266
00:22:45,865 --> 00:22:46,956
「也沒有方向」
nor will.

267
00:22:55,141 --> 00:22:59,424
年輕美麗的小姐不該記住這麼黑暗的意象
These are dark notions for a beautiful young woman to take to heart.

268
00:23:00,061 --> 00:23:02,343
我的人生有時就這麼黑暗
My life can be dark sometimes.

269
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:08,641
人生得一知己
Kindred spirits, like yourself,

270
00:23:09,340 --> 00:23:11,068
一世難求啊
are difficult to find.

271
00:24:03,107 --> 00:24:05,076
你的嘴脣好像羽毛
Your lips are like feathers.

272
00:24:06,585 --> 00:24:08,703
要它們帶你飛翔嗎?
Shall they help you take flight?

273
00:24:23,917 --> 00:24:26,789
歡迎光臨卡特韋太太家 先生
Welcome to Mrs Castaway's, sir!

274
00:24:27,396 --> 00:24:30,770
開一夜房 要五先令
The use of the room will cost you five shillings.

275
00:24:30,771 --> 00:24:34,480
再加兩先令 還有美酒等着您
There can be good wine waiting for an additional two

276
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:38,408
可是上面發生什麼 要多久
but what happens up there, and for how long,

277
00:24:38,409 --> 00:24:42,281
就由您和蘇糖自便了
is for you and Sugar to put a value to.

278
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,542
這是十先令
Here's ten shillings.

279
00:24:49,097 --> 00:24:50,370
給我送酒上去
Send up some wine.

280
00:25:59,980 --> 00:26:01,949
你累了 亨特先生
You're tired, Mr Hunt.

281
00:26:02,976 --> 00:26:04,522
我很久沒好好睡覺了
I haven't been sleeping.

282
00:26:07,702 --> 00:26:09,185
夜裏躺在牀上...
I go to bed at night...

283
00:26:10,635 --> 00:26:11,899
也是通宵醒着
..and just lie awake.

284
00:26:13,902 --> 00:26:17,524
好吧 我們來好好照顧你
Well...we shall have to take good care of you.

285
00:26:24,924 --> 00:26:26,838
爐邊客棧的烈性麥酒
Strong ale at the Fireside.

286
00:26:55,703 --> 00:26:59,284
「他從無夢的宿醉中醒來...」
'He woke from his dreamless drunkard's sleep...

287
00:26:59,967 --> 00:27:03,159
「只見她正要割開他喉嚨」
'and found her poised to cut his throat.'

288
00:27:25,139 --> 00:27:26,515
早安 亨特先生
Good morning, Mr Hunt.

289
00:27:27,418 --> 00:27:28,279
早安?
Morning?

290
00:27:30,473 --> 00:27:33,213
我睡了這麼久?      你很累了
I've slept so long?        Well, you were very tired.

291
00:27:34,856 --> 00:27:37,348
還眞有點累 現在大概是...
Yes, I was. I believe it's...

292
00:27:43,934 --> 00:27:47,583
蘇糖小姐 我似乎非常可惜 非常可恥地
Miss Sugar, I have suffered a most regrettable, most shameful

293
00:27:47,985 --> 00:27:48,797
失禁了
loss of control.

294
00:27:48,798 --> 00:27:51,723
濕衣服脱掉 亨特先生 馬上
Throw off your wet things, Mr Hunt. At once.

295
00:27:53,186 --> 00:27:54,411
這眞是太過份了...
That is quite beyond...

296
00:27:54,677 --> 00:27:58,287
我不指望你...        衣服拿來 謝謝
I can't expect you...        Your things, please, now.

297
00:28:37,491 --> 00:28:38,790
這眞是...
This really is...

298
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,284
躺下吧
Lie back, now.

299
00:28:44,426 --> 00:28:46,203
一切都會好的
All will soon be set to rights.

300
00:29:02,770 --> 00:29:04,221
小可憐
Poor baby.

301
00:30:10,106 --> 00:30:12,628
我太浪費你的時間了
I have taken up an unconscionable amount of your time.

302
00:30:12,629 --> 00:30:13,797
完全沒有
Not at all.

303
00:30:16,594 --> 00:30:19,642
你眞是個有趣的男人 喬治·亨特
You are a very interesting man, George Hunt.

304
00:30:20,256 --> 00:30:21,879
我應該看看你的書
I shall look out for your books.

305
00:30:23,731 --> 00:30:24,277
蘇糖小姐...
Miss Sugar...

306
00:30:24,278 --> 00:30:26,554
沒有小姐 就叫蘇糖
No Miss. Just Sugar.

307
00:30:27,016 --> 00:30:28,455
我的名字並不是...
My name is not, erm...

308
00:30:29,673 --> 00:30:30,989
叫我威廉吧
Please just call me William.

309
00:30:32,957 --> 00:30:36,781
原諒我的謊言 對男士來説聲譽很重要
Forgive the deception, but a man has a reputation to uphold.

310
00:30:38,950 --> 00:30:41,559
姓名又有什麼意義呢?      是啊
And what's in a name?        Indeed!

311
00:30:42,049 --> 00:30:44,464
這句話來自...       「羅密歐與茱麗葉」
That's actually a line from...        Romeo And Juliet.

312
00:30:48,176 --> 00:30:53,170
再説...也許你很難見到我出版的作品
Also...you may struggle to find my work in published form.

313
00:30:54,835 --> 00:30:56,806
寫作並不是我唯一的職業
Writing is not my sole occupation.

314
00:30:58,104 --> 00:30:58,949
當然
Well, of course.

315
00:31:01,749 --> 00:31:04,945
像你這樣擁有抑制不住的好奇心
Why would a man with your unquenchable curiosity,

316
00:31:04,946 --> 00:31:07,915
博學多才 熟知世上種種奇蹟的男人
your Renaissance grasp of the world and its wonders,

317
00:31:07,916 --> 00:31:09,853
怎麼會侷限在一個職業之中呢?
limit himself to just one sphere?

318
00:31:14,292 --> 00:31:17,850
你當然會以這獨特而執着的心靈
Surely you would bring the same originality of mind

319
00:31:17,851 --> 00:31:20,925
以不變應萬變吧?
and fixity of purpose to anything you were about?

320
00:31:23,482 --> 00:31:26,490
藝術家手中 一切皆可爲藝術
All turns to art in the artist's hand.

321
00:31:56,773 --> 00:31:57,694
福克斯太太
Mrs Fox,

322
00:31:58,658 --> 00:32:00,800
我必須爲上次的事再次道歉
I must apologise again for our last encounter.

323
00:32:00,801 --> 00:32:03,555
那時我和弟弟正處在最尶尬的處境
You found my brother and I at our absolute worst.

324
00:32:03,782 --> 00:32:05,126
不會吧
Oh, I doubt that.

325
00:32:06,247 --> 00:32:07,976
也許我該向你道歉
And I perhaps owe you an apology.

326
00:32:07,977 --> 00:32:10,319
我那晚太心不在焉了
I was much preoccupied that night.

327
00:32:11,917 --> 00:32:14,306
你的剋制只顯得禮數周全
I put your reserve down to good manners.

328
00:32:16,376 --> 00:32:18,357
我下午去了一家妓院
I had that afternoon visited a bawdy-house

329
00:32:18,358 --> 00:32:21,127
探訪一個快離開人世的女孩
to see a girl plainly not long for this world.

330
00:32:21,544 --> 00:32:25,466
老天...      這很常見 有人專做病美人生意
Good L...        That's not uncommon, there's a trade in sick girls.

331
00:32:25,852 --> 00:32:26,886
我向老鴇抗議過
I once complained to a madam

332
00:32:26,887 --> 00:32:28,786
一個女孩甚至都站不穩了
that one of her employees could barely stand.

333
00:32:28,787 --> 00:32:30,663
她告訴我這不需要站着
She told me standing was not mandatory,

334
00:32:30,664 --> 00:32:32,600
還説我看起來也很憔悴
that I looked a bit peaky myself,

335
00:32:32,928 --> 00:32:35,075
要不要找個房間躺下休息
and would I like to lie down in the spare room.

336
00:32:37,106 --> 00:32:40,190
眞是狡猾又放肆的建議
A most sly and licentious suggestion.

337
00:32:42,029 --> 00:32:43,476
你看我像生病了嗎?
Do I look ill to you?

338
00:32:45,989 --> 00:32:47,084
完全沒有
Not at all.

339
00:33:04,677 --> 00:33:06,657
好多了 萊蒂 眞的好多了
Better, Letty, much better.

340
00:33:07,451 --> 00:33:09,384
除了把自己再弄乾淨點兒
Though you might tidy yourself up a little.

341
00:33:12,593 --> 00:33:15,830
以不變應萬變
Fixity of purpose.

342
00:33:19,778 --> 00:33:21,461
我一定要治好病
I am going to get well.

343
00:33:21,732 --> 00:33:23,151
就算會被折磨死
Even if it kills me.

344
00:33:37,935 --> 00:33:39,573
最親愛的艾格尼絲
Agnes, dearest.

345
00:33:41,015 --> 00:33:42,392
他們使出看家本領了
They've really pushed the boat out.

346
00:33:42,924 --> 00:33:44,259
希望你有個好食慾
I hope you have an appetite.

347
00:33:49,398 --> 00:33:51,890
今天你能下來 眞是個愉快的巧合
What a happy coincidence it is that you've come down today.

348
00:33:52,903 --> 00:33:55,888
巧合？       我制定了新的準則
Coincidence?        I am ushering in a new regime.

349
00:33:56,340 --> 00:33:58,080
還給僕人們做了評估
Including a review of the staff.

350
00:33:59,466 --> 00:34:01,312
家裏都亂成一團了
The household is out of hand.

351
00:34:01,772 --> 00:34:02,898
並不只是今天
And it's not just today,

352
00:34:02,899 --> 00:34:05,675
我是説 下雨天讓僕人們都手忙腳亂
I mean the rain makes the servants skittish, of course.

353
00:34:05,957 --> 00:34:07,054
我經常觀察到這件事
I've observed this so often,

354
00:34:07,055 --> 00:34:10,170
可以寫篇文章投給「笨拙」(19世紀倫敦幽默諷刺雜誌)
I mean to write a short piece for Punch on the topic.

355
00:34:10,679 --> 00:34:14,039
問題是 僕人們需要女主人的領導
The fact is, servants look to their mistress for guidance,

356
00:34:14,490 --> 00:34:16,977
接着管理他們對你也有好處 親愛的
and a return to overseeing them might be good for you, dear.

357
00:34:18,770 --> 00:34:22,119
他們不能...自己處理嗎?
Can't...can't they just sort it out among themselves?

358
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:25,044
你不是常這樣説嗎?
I mean, isn't that what you always used to talk about?

359
00:34:25,302 --> 00:34:26,451
社會主義?
Socialism?

360
00:34:27,757 --> 00:34:32,956
社會主義不等於僕人失控
There is a difference between socialism and the staff running amok.

361
00:34:36,718 --> 00:34:40,880
不知亨利忙完教堂的事會來嗎 我喜歡他 你呢?
I wonder if Henry will come after church? I like him, don't you?

362
00:34:41,213 --> 00:34:46,175
最近的星期天 亨利都和福克斯太太在一起
Henry lately seems to spend his Sundays in the company of Mrs Fox.

363
00:34:46,350 --> 00:34:49,121
科魯醫生的妹妹 那個寡婦? 你不是説...
Dr Curlew's sister, the widow? You don't mean...

364
00:34:51,793 --> 00:34:52,733
不是
No!

365
00:34:54,572 --> 00:34:55,580
上帝 不是
God, no!

366
00:34:56,755 --> 00:35:01,677
福克斯太太只在乎她深愛的救濟社
And Mrs Fox is far too preoccupied with her beloved Rescue Society.

367
00:35:01,911 --> 00:35:03,589
福克斯太太解救別人?
Mrs Fox rescues people?

368
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:06,162
妓女 親愛的
Prostitutes, dear.

369
00:35:07,714 --> 00:35:09,974
我會告訴你 這無濟於事
A pointless crusade, if you ask me.

370
00:35:10,395 --> 00:35:13,071
她不明白 大多數這種女孩
It doesn't seem to have occurred to her that many of these girls

371
00:35:13,072 --> 00:35:14,372
都享受她們的工作
enjoy their work.

372
00:35:16,547 --> 00:35:18,307
你還好吧 艾格尼絲?
Are you quite all right, Agnes?

373
00:35:19,368 --> 00:35:20,196
要不要...
Would you like...

374
00:35:29,346 --> 00:35:30,140
克拉拉
Clara!

375
00:35:30,323 --> 00:35:33,395
萊蒂 珍妮       拉克漢太太?
Letty, Janey!        Mrs Rackham?

376
00:35:34,961 --> 00:35:35,964
拉克漢太太
Mrs Rackham.

377
00:35:37,875 --> 00:35:40,398
克拉拉 馬上去叫科魯醫生
Clara, send for Dr Curlew at once.

378
00:35:40,613 --> 00:35:43,871
不要       不 拉克漢先生
No, no.        No, Mr Rackham.

379
00:35:43,872 --> 00:35:45,028
照我説的做
Do as I ask!

380
00:36:18,030 --> 00:36:21,346
藝術家手中 一切皆可爲藝術
All turn to art in an artist's hands.

381
00:36:42,645 --> 00:36:45,448
你這麼突然就改變主意了?
All very sudden, this change of heart?

382
00:36:46,821 --> 00:36:49,322
上天的指示和安排 父親
A revelation of Damascan proportions, sir.

383
00:36:50,435 --> 00:36:51,635
我煥然一新了
I am a new man.

384
00:36:52,322 --> 00:36:55,672
我還以爲你要歡樂的跑進來 把鉅額支票拍在我桌上
And I'm expected to jig for joy and slap a fat cheque on the desk,

385
00:36:55,673 --> 00:36:59,547
是這樣嗎?        不是 我要證明自己 父親
is that it?        No, I wish to prove myself, father.

386
00:37:01,199 --> 00:37:02,135
可以嗎?
If I may?

387
00:37:04,677 --> 00:37:05,883
我帶來了我
I have brought my...

388
00:37:07,452 --> 00:37:11,814
我對拉克漢家族賬目 不可抑制的好奇心
..unquenchable curiosity to bear on the Rackham accounts.

389
00:37:26,458 --> 00:37:27,707
啊 威廉
Why, William.

390
00:37:28,598 --> 00:37:30,717
能這麼快再見到你 眞好
What a pleasure to see you again, and so soon.

391
00:37:30,718 --> 00:37:32,850
我給你帶了東西       眞的?
I brought you something.        Really?

392
00:37:33,054 --> 00:37:35,778
上次忘記給你的
Something I forgot to give you last time.

393
00:37:36,892 --> 00:37:38,186
你要寵壞我了
You spoil me.

394
00:37:53,769 --> 00:37:54,928
亨特先生
Mr Hunt!

395
00:37:56,498 --> 00:37:59,620
亨特先生 噢 亨特先生
Mr Hunt! Oh, Mr Hunt!

396
00:38:01,459 --> 00:38:02,809
亨特先生
Mr Hunt!

397
00:38:03,470 --> 00:38:04,550
亨特先生
Mr Hunt!

398
00:38:05,037 --> 00:38:06,040
亨特先生
Mr Hunt!

399
00:38:06,041 --> 00:38:10,417
我叫威廉·拉克漢
My name is William Rackham!

400
00:38:32,916 --> 00:38:34,787
沒想到我還能見到這一天
I never thought I'd see the day.

401
00:38:43,883 --> 00:38:46,622
你來遲了 蘇糖從來不等別人
You're too late. Sugar don't wait for no-one.

402
00:39:25,446 --> 00:39:26,793
考慮一下吧?
Will you consider it?

403
00:39:26,794 --> 00:39:29,371
我對蘇糖的專屬佔有權
Exclusive patronage of Sugar by me.

404
00:39:38,116 --> 00:39:38,966
不
No.

405
00:39:41,733 --> 00:39:44,852
爲什麼?       問題很複雜
What?        These matters are complex.

406
00:39:45,543 --> 00:39:47,328
我們這是家小買賣
We have a small house here.

407
00:39:47,695 --> 00:39:51,443
如果三分之一的服務都提供不了
If a third of what we offer is unavailable,

408
00:39:52,049 --> 00:39:53,569
那我們怎麼辦?
where does that leave us?

409
00:39:59,504 --> 00:40:01,092
還有其它的問題
Then there are other complications.

410
00:40:01,093 --> 00:40:06,138
比如説?       我們和爐邊客棧的關係
Such as?        Our bond of mutual regard with The Fireside.

411
00:40:06,551 --> 00:40:11,151
你這麼仰慕蘇糖的才色 當然也
Surely you, who are so appreciative of Sugar's merits,

412
00:40:11,152 --> 00:40:12,627
看的出她是那裏的王牌
can see she is a draw there.

413
00:40:12,628 --> 00:40:14,156
這只是細節
These are details.

414
00:40:15,223 --> 00:40:18,108
我只有一個原則
It's the principle of the matter that I'm concerned with.

415
00:40:19,611 --> 00:40:20,804
原則?
The principle?

416
00:40:21,477 --> 00:40:23,396
蘇糖她自己是否同意?
Whether Sugar herself would agree?

417
00:40:25,244 --> 00:40:26,507
能讓她下來嗎?
Might she come down?

418
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:29,654
畢竟 這是她自己的未來
It is her future at stake, after all.

419
00:40:39,403 --> 00:40:42,080
還有一個方面你沒考慮到
There is another thing you haven't allowed for.

420
00:40:43,513 --> 00:40:47,571
萬一要是蘇糖本人喜歡
You don't consider the possibility that Sugar might prefer -

421
00:40:47,993 --> 00:40:52,116
恕我直言 喜歡多樣化呢?
forgive me - she might prefer variety?

422
00:40:53,444 --> 00:40:55,332
好吧 讓她自己決定
Well, we shall let her decide.

423
00:40:59,342 --> 00:41:01,380
亨特先生 見到你眞高興
Why, Mr Hunt, what a pleasure.

424
00:41:01,744 --> 00:41:03,182
亨特先生
Mr Hunt...

425
00:41:03,846 --> 00:41:06,897
有個提議給你 蘇糖
has a proposition for you, Sugar.

426
00:41:06,898 --> 00:41:08,597
我聽説了
So I understand.

427
00:41:08,598 --> 00:41:09,600
我想問一句
If I may.

428
00:41:10,886 --> 00:41:13,555
我們都不明白的是
What none of us understands is,

429
00:41:13,892 --> 00:41:17,568
除了給妓院方面的價錢...
outside of your arrangement with the house itself...

430
00:41:19,714 --> 00:41:22,227
你還可以給蘇糖什麼?
..what will you pay Sugar?

431
00:41:24,752 --> 00:41:26,639
我會不惜一切讓她開心
I will pay her whatever makes her happy.

432
00:41:37,050 --> 00:41:38,703
好的 亨特先生...
Well, Mr Hunt...

433
00:41:40,464 --> 00:41:41,490
我願意
I am willing.

434
00:41:50,937 --> 00:41:51,864
幾點了?
What time is it?

435
00:42:05,912 --> 00:42:08,332
你不用再辛苦工作了
You don't need to take in copy work any more,

436
00:42:08,709 --> 00:42:11,460
不需要把自己搞的如此不堪了
or whatever it is you do to get yourself in such a mess!

437
00:42:23,443 --> 00:42:26,778
拉克漢的産品裏有專門針對乾性皮膚的
You know, Rackham's does manufacture a product for dry skin.

438
00:42:30,238 --> 00:42:32,991
可我已經是阿特金熊油的奴隸了
But I'm a slave to Atkinson's Bear's Grease.

439
00:42:38,110 --> 00:42:40,575
你的人生從今以後就不同了
Your life is going to be very different from now on.

440
00:42:42,292 --> 00:42:44,458
希望有些東西還是一樣
I hope some things remain the same.

441
00:43:03,002 --> 00:43:05,723
（必須要出去）
must get out

442
00:43:14,099 --> 00:43:16,349
（必須要多出去）
Must get out more

443
00:43:47,121 --> 00:43:48,588
你的僕人安息日都在工作?
Your men work on the Sabbath?

444
00:43:48,589 --> 00:43:50,930
像我一樣 一天都不夠用 亨利
As do I! Not enough hours in the day, Henry.

445
00:43:51,549 --> 00:43:54,505
你知道香水也分八個調性
Did you know that there's an octave in perfume

446
00:43:54,506 --> 00:43:55,762
像音樂那樣嗎?
as there is in music?

447
00:43:59,270 --> 00:44:01,189
好吧 需要幫忙嗎?
Anyway, how can I help?

448
00:44:01,290 --> 00:44:02,835
你有想到過媽媽嗎?
Do you ever think of mother?

449
00:44:05,325 --> 00:44:06,199
沒有
No.

450
00:44:08,202 --> 00:44:13,168
你很小時她就...去世了
You were very young when she, erm...passed on.

451
00:44:15,313 --> 00:44:16,988
亨利 她和別的男人跑了
Henry, she ran off with another man.

452
00:44:18,419 --> 00:44:19,976
抛棄了我們
She abandoned us.

453
00:44:21,627 --> 00:44:26,231
我有時覺得 我們成長中
I am conscious, sometimes, that we lacked

454
00:44:26,786 --> 00:44:29,194
環境裏缺乏...
growing up any, erm...

455
00:44:32,649 --> 00:44:34,583
女性的陪伴
Female society.

456
00:44:36,403 --> 00:44:39,671
你也知道吧 福克斯太太一直致力於幫助...
You know, of course, of Mrs Fox's efforts in the, erm...

457
00:44:40,949 --> 00:44:43,550
社會的黑暗底層人士?
in the darkest recesses of the city?

458
00:44:43,873 --> 00:44:47,222
我想她的行動支援
Well, I thought that her practical support

459
00:44:47,223 --> 00:44:52,590
也許還需要我的...理論化的支持
might be well-supplemented by my more, doctrinal approach.

460
00:44:53,818 --> 00:44:55,494
可我的問題是...
My problem, though, is this -

461
00:44:56,726 --> 00:44:59,544
如果我想去關照
if I am to minister to, erm...

462
00:45:03,867 --> 00:45:05,393
失足婦女...
..fallen women...

463
00:45:09,046 --> 00:45:10,914
怎麼纔能辨認出她們呢?
..how shall I recognise them?

464
00:45:35,899 --> 00:45:39,664
你好點了嗎?       熊油的效果很棒
Yer 'ands any better?        This bear's grease is miraculous.

465
00:45:44,047 --> 00:45:45,026
你的書怎麼樣了?
How's yer book?

466
00:45:50,547 --> 00:45:52,181
你知道我自學的識字
You know, I taught myself to read.

467
00:45:53,693 --> 00:45:54,749
我可以教你
I could teach you.

468
00:45:57,238 --> 00:45:58,208
不需要
Don't need it.

469
00:46:11,646 --> 00:46:13,360
(拉克漢香水公司)

470
00:46:43,380 --> 00:46:44,616
注意身後
watch your back!

471
00:46:46,230 --> 00:46:51,015
只要一先令 我的手就屬於你 其它部分兩先令
My hand is yours for a shillin', sir, and any other part for two.

472
00:46:51,653 --> 00:46:53,875
請把衣服穿好
Please, cover yourself up.

473
00:46:54,916 --> 00:46:56,799
身體髮膚不是拿來買賣的
Your body parts are not yours to sell.

474
00:46:57,065 --> 00:47:01,330
他們相互依存 全部屬於上帝
They belong together, and the whole belongs to God.

475
00:47:02,013 --> 00:47:05,238
我的週身都屬於給的起兩先令的人 先生
My 'ole belongs to anyone that's got two shillings, sir.

476
00:47:10,059 --> 00:47:11,150
聽我説
Listen to me.

477
00:47:11,697 --> 00:47:14,301
我要你把這兩先令當成
I want you to see these two shillings as an act

478
00:47:14,302 --> 00:47:15,751
不需再履行的行爲
that's no longer necessary.

479
00:47:16,786 --> 00:47:19,348
它代替了...可以説是
It's in lieu, which is to say,

480
00:47:20,584 --> 00:47:22,215
任何你打算做的事
whatever you were about to do,

481
00:47:24,318 --> 00:47:25,199
求你 別這樣了
please, I beg you, don't.

482
00:47:26,156 --> 00:47:30,754
「求你了 他請求着 拽着他的絲質領結」
"Please," he begged, tugging at the silken bonds.

483
00:47:30,755 --> 00:47:33,872
「讓我走 我是個大人物」
"Let me go. I am an important man!"

484
00:47:35,177 --> 00:47:37,537
「那就告訴我 高貴的紳士」
"So tell me, exalted sir,

「願意我的匕首從你身體哪部分刺進去?」
"where is it your pleasure to have this blade enter you?"

486
00:47:48,314 --> 00:47:49,247
先生
Sir.

487
00:47:52,056 --> 00:47:53,116
你遲到了
You're late.

488
00:47:53,427 --> 00:47:55,687
工作太辛苦吧 拉克漢先生?
Hard at work, Mr Rackham?

489
00:47:55,688 --> 00:47:56,949
我給你帶了東西
And I brought you something.

490
00:48:00,329 --> 00:48:02,016
我幾個朋友出版的
A couple of my friends produced it,

491
00:48:02,017 --> 00:48:03,721
它叫做「禱告的效力」
it's called The Efficacy of Prayer.

492
00:48:05,194 --> 00:48:06,335
「波德利與阿什韋」
"Bodley and Ashwell."

493
00:48:15,450 --> 00:48:16,912
眞是幼稚
How perfectly childish.

494
00:48:17,664 --> 00:48:18,921
他們是不是沒事可做了?
Have they nothing better to do?

495
00:48:23,982 --> 00:48:26,224
沒事可做
No, nothing

496
00:48:26,364 --> 00:48:28,997
而你卻...       在這裏
Whereas you...        Exactly!

497
00:48:28,998 --> 00:48:31,095
生意如何?       棒極了
How is the business?        Splendid.

498
00:48:31,807 --> 00:48:32,893
你的敵人呢?
And your rivals?

499
00:48:33,678 --> 00:48:35,321
競爭對手強硬麼?
Is the competition stiff?

500
00:48:36,985 --> 00:48:39,634
皮爾斯和亞德里非常頑強
Well, Pears and Yardley are unassailable.

501
00:48:40,391 --> 00:48:43,444
羅蘭和芮謎身體很好
Rowland and Rimmel are in good health.

502
00:48:44,058 --> 00:48:47,931
尼斯本生病了 也許是致命疾病
Nisbett is ailing, perhaps fatally.

503
00:48:49,284 --> 00:48:51,285
對不起 是不是很無聊?
I'm sorry, is this terribly dull?

504
00:48:51,486 --> 00:48:54,001
一直講生意上的事?       無聊?
All this talk of business?        Dull?

505
00:48:54,613 --> 00:48:55,536
還有誰比我
Who understands better than I

506
00:48:55,537 --> 00:48:57,643
更懂藝術和商業的聯繫?
the connection between commerce and art?

507
00:48:59,084 --> 00:49:02,655
我在想拉克漢産品的目錄
On which subject, I've been thinking about this Rackham's catalogue.

508
00:49:05,427 --> 00:49:06,825
熏衣草潤足霜
"Lavender foot balm.

509
00:49:07,496 --> 00:49:10,267
「腳臭是你的阿喀琉斯之踵嗎?」
"Are malodorous feet your Achilles' heel?"

510
00:49:12,244 --> 00:49:13,608
我知道
I know, I know.

511
00:49:13,929 --> 00:49:15,375
這是很早以前的
It was written years ago.

512
00:49:15,376 --> 00:49:18,039
爸爸寫的 一點也不優雅
Father's work. Hardly elegant.

513
00:49:19,633 --> 00:49:21,138
爲什麼不重寫?
So why not rewrite it?

514
00:49:25,762 --> 00:49:26,853
還太早了
It's early days.

515
00:49:27,247 --> 00:49:28,846
父親應該還沒準備好
I'm not sure Father's ready.

516
00:49:32,450 --> 00:49:35,050
該是你帶頭的時刻了 而不是隨波逐流
It's time for you to lead, not follow.

517
00:49:36,650 --> 00:49:39,137
讓我們的生意配的上拉克漢的名號
Let's make the business worthy of the Rackham name.

518
00:49:39,993 --> 00:49:41,500
是威廉·拉克漢
William Rackham, that is.

519
00:49:46,918 --> 00:49:48,597
沒有你我該怎麼辦
What would I do without you?

520
00:50:34,631 --> 00:50:37,120
(地址 切普斯托路)

521
00:51:06,611 --> 00:51:07,856
拉克漢太太
Mrs Rackham?

522
00:51:10,220 --> 00:51:11,023
你醒了
you're awake.

523
00:51:11,258 --> 00:51:14,217
是的 我想今天在樓下吃飯 克拉拉
Yes. I mean to take breakfast downstairs this morning, Clara.

524
00:51:14,908 --> 00:51:16,702
您記得拉克漢先生今天不在嗎?
Have you remembered that Mr Rackham is away?

525
00:51:17,179 --> 00:51:18,801
他去了丹地
He has gone to Dundee.

526
00:51:19,438 --> 00:51:21,004
所以您要一個人吃早餐嗎?
So you'll take breakfast alone?

527
00:51:23,467 --> 00:51:25,417
我覺得這樣更輕鬆
I think I shall find it easier that way.

528
00:51:28,804 --> 00:51:30,476
我今早感覺特別精神 克拉拉
I feel so light this morning, Clara,

529
00:51:30,477 --> 00:51:32,415
眞是無法描述的輕鬆
I can't tell you what a relief it is!

530
00:51:34,471 --> 00:51:37,255
早餐後 我要做我的裙子了
After breakfast, I shall work on my dresses.

531
00:51:37,977 --> 00:51:40,447
畢竟 社交季快到了
The season is almost upon us, after all.

532
00:51:40,650 --> 00:51:41,934
可以把它拿過來嗎?
Would you bring them for me?

533
00:51:48,340 --> 00:51:49,521
克拉拉 因爲...
Clara, with, erm...

534
00:51:51,538 --> 00:51:54,923
因爲社交季快到了 一定...
..with the season so close, there are certain, er...

535
00:51:56,444 --> 00:51:59,865
我還需要複習其他的技藝 比如...
skills I will need to re-master, such as, erm...

536
00:52:03,521 --> 00:52:05,593
走出去...
..going outside, and, erm...

537
00:52:07,057 --> 00:52:08,974
不需要人陪着 去散步
walking unsupported.

538
00:52:09,559 --> 00:52:12,363
我想一會兒可以試試
I was, I was thinking we might try later.

539
00:52:12,819 --> 00:52:14,124
如果您吃的消的話
If you feel up to it.

540
00:52:14,614 --> 00:52:17,081
也許等科魯醫生在的時候?
Perhaps after Dr Curlew's been round?

541
00:52:18,503 --> 00:52:19,699
可他一定...
But surely...

542
00:52:20,694 --> 00:52:22,323
今天他一定不會來吧?
Surely he isn't coming today?

543
00:52:24,183 --> 00:52:25,110
不 我...
No, I'm...

544
00:52:27,793 --> 00:52:29,491
我不要見他 克拉拉
I won't see him, Clara.

545
00:52:29,492 --> 00:52:30,568
就是不要
I simply won't.

546
00:52:39,366 --> 00:52:40,443
切普斯托路
Chepstow Villas.

547
00:52:43,887 --> 00:52:45,705
勞駕你遠道而來
I'm sorry you have come all this way

548
00:52:45,706 --> 00:52:49,199
不巧的是對你來説 我非常好
because, unfortunately, for you, I am quite well.

549
00:52:52,051 --> 00:52:53,476
我看你很蒼白
You're looking very pale to me.

550
00:52:55,522 --> 00:52:57,609
也許是因爲臉上撲的粉吧?
That may be the face powder, mayn't it?

551
00:52:57,958 --> 00:53:00,696
我不是告訴你不要用化粧品嗎?
Have I not cautioned you against the use of cosmetics?

552
00:53:01,389 --> 00:53:04,052
你不是説你已經扔...
And did you not tell me that you had disp...

553
00:53:04,053 --> 00:53:07,363
扔掉了 對 所以肯定不是
Disposed of it, yes. So I did. So it cannot be that.

554
00:53:07,524 --> 00:53:09,952
可是我太累 不想檢査了
But I am too tired to be examined.

555
00:53:09,953 --> 00:53:12,488
你的疲倦或許是疾病的症狀
Your tiredness may in itself be a symptom of illness.

556
00:53:16,225 --> 00:53:17,882
你每週都給我做檢査
You examine me every week.

557
00:53:17,883 --> 00:53:21,211
一次不做又會怎樣?
What harm can it do to leave it undone just this once?

558
00:53:21,212 --> 00:53:23,301
只有瘋女人纔願意讓自己惡化下去
Only a madwoman would willingly let her health decline...

559
00:53:23,302 --> 00:53:26,661
我不是瘋女人       所以我纔開口請求
I am not a madwoman!        Which is why I ask permission,

560
00:53:27,546 --> 00:53:31,658
而不是像對瘋人院的病人一樣強迫
rather than obliging you as I would an asylum inmate.

561
00:53:38,303 --> 00:53:39,103
克拉拉
Clara?

562
00:53:41,303 --> 00:53:42,819
我要留下嗎?
Should I stay?

563
00:53:44,530 --> 00:53:45,523
不用
No.

564
00:54:16,681 --> 00:54:19,256
疼痛是抗拒引起的
The pain lies entirely in the resistance.

565
00:54:33,680 --> 00:54:34,448
放鬆
Little more.

566
00:54:37,530 --> 00:54:38,714
再放鬆
Little more.

567
00:54:46,131 --> 00:54:46,872
好的
Good.

568
00:54:50,468 --> 00:54:51,548
謝謝
Thank you.

569
00:55:57,511 --> 00:55:59,931
這條裙子很難修補了 你覺得呢?
The dresses will be hard to mend, don't you think?

570
00:56:00,316 --> 00:56:02,003
不可能補好了
I don't think we can mend them.

571
00:56:05,162 --> 00:56:06,709
我做夢了 克拉拉
I dream, you know, Clara.

572
00:56:08,470 --> 00:56:09,251
夢?
Dream?

573
00:56:10,847 --> 00:56:12,263
夢到一個地方 不是...
Of a place. Not...

574
00:56:13,526 --> 00:56:16,816
一個不是眞實存在的地方
Not a place with a physical dimension, but one that does exist.

575
00:56:19,888 --> 00:56:21,170
到處都是鴿子
Full of nuns,

576
00:56:22,204 --> 00:56:24,563
她們溫柔的像天使
so gentle they might be angels.

577
00:56:28,741 --> 00:56:30,319
我希望她們來接我
I wish they'd send for me.

578
00:57:08,615 --> 00:57:10,109
我的上帝
My God.

579
00:57:12,704 --> 00:57:14,226
威廉·拉克漢
William Rackham.

580
00:57:16,130 --> 00:57:18,232
你得對我更好點了
You'll keep me better than you do now.

581
00:57:48,296 --> 00:57:51,185
(切普斯托路)
Chepstow Villas.

582
00:58:02,620 --> 00:58:03,476
等等
Wait, wait!

583
00:58:20,378 --> 00:58:21,812
我的天使
My angel...

584
00:58:25,031 --> 00:58:26,625
終於來了
come at last.

585
00:58:27,581 --> 00:58:30,081
<font color="#4096d1">第一集 終
謝謝觀賞</font>
