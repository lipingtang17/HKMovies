1
00:01:09,830 --> 00:01:12,030
Why are there so many people died today?

2
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,870
(Luk: The 8319th night)

3
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:53,860
Luk, dinner is ready

4
00:02:56,370 --> 00:02:57,070
Coming

5
00:02:58,570 --> 00:02:59,600
Hurry

6
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:01,570
AImost done

7
00:03:02,210 --> 00:03:03,200
Give me a minute

8
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:04,870
One minute

9
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:24,400
Hello?

10
00:03:26,570 --> 00:03:27,090
Yes

11
00:03:27,170 --> 00:03:28,730
Yes¡­ Speaking¡­

12
00:03:29,570 --> 00:03:30,770
Tomorrow afternoon?

13
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:34,800
Yes, okay¡­ no problem¡­

14
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,740
Yes, I got it¡­

15
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:42,080
Then I'll bring all my works  to your comic books company

16
00:03:42,350 --> 00:03:44,980
May I have your address please?

17
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:48,720
Yes, IFC. (International Finance Centre)

18
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:50,120
Yes, I got it¡­

19
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:52,860
IFC in Kwun Tong?

20
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,750
Okay¡­

21
00:03:58,130 --> 00:04:02,690
Room 1804 to Room 1808

22
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:08,730
Yes, use the door at 1806, okay

23
00:04:09,710 --> 00:04:12,650
I totally got it¡­

24
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:14,180
Thanks¡­

25
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:23,480
(Dinner is ready.)

26
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:35,600
(Give me a minute.)

27
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:06,320
Julia

28
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:13,600
Julia

29
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:42,630
Shit!

30
00:05:49,410 --> 00:05:50,430
Damn!

31
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:53,510
I've a problem

32
00:05:54,850 --> 00:05:56,340
Hi, Julia?

33
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:00,310
Well, there's only one set of  lingerie left in the dresser

34
00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:02,550
Wonder if there's a sex maniac

35
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:04,820
broke in last night and stole them¡­

36
00:06:04,890 --> 00:06:06,290
except for this set?

37
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:08,330
Fortunately, this is the set I like most

38
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:11,390
No way, Julia doesn't  like me being frivolous

39
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:15,430
Julia, could you spare me a few minutes?

40
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:18,260
I sincerely apologize to you

41
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:21,740
Yesterday I missed our big day

42
00:06:21,810 --> 00:06:25,370
because today is so important to me

43
00:06:26,110 --> 00:06:29,020
Today will bring change to my career¡­

44
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:30,520
Today will bring change to my fate

45
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:34,480
Sounds good, that's it

46
00:06:43,530 --> 00:06:44,360
Hello?

47
00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:47,230
Ju¡­ Julia

48
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,830
Sorry

49
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:52,340
I'm moving, I'll call you once settled

50
00:06:53,010 --> 00:06:55,030
You better get ready  to go to the publisher

51
00:06:56,310 --> 00:06:58,470
How do you know that?

52
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:00,740
I overheard a little and I guessed so

53
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,420
You stilI have stomach gas

54
00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:07,480
You better eat before you go

55
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,680
Stomach gas goes up, you burp

56
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:13,590
Stomach gas goes down, you fart.  Both are not nice

57
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:16,320
The reception here is bad.  I'll call you later, bye

58
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:39,650
Spongy Chicken

59
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:40,950
One please¡­

60
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:43,180
Okay, just a sec

61
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,990
Be careful¡­ it's hot

62
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,490
Thanks

63
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,890
Hey, that's mine!       Sorry

64
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:52,130
That one is mine.       Okay¡­ thanks

65
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,690
The spongy chicken is good.       Yes

66
00:07:53,770 --> 00:07:54,530
Waiter, one please

67
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,160
Okay¡­ be careful, it's really hot

68
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,430
Bill please

69
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:00,840
Thanks

70
00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:06,540
The fish maw is delicious

71
00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:09,710
You've been fooling around

72
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:11,510
putting no effort in educating yourself

73
00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:14,050
Fish maws are so expensive,  how could they serve them here?

74
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,780
That's just pig's skin

75
00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:17,510
Pig's skin?

76
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:21,990
I order Spongy Chicken for the ham

77
00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:23,360
Ham?

78
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:26,530
Then why don't you go to a steak house  and order ham steak instead?

79
00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:28,470
You've come to a tea house  to order spongy chicken

80
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:30,270
just for the ham?

81
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:31,810
Did I tell you not to eat the side dish?

82
00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:33,860
I'm just telling you to eat the ham first

83
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:35,930
You stilI don't get it

84
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:39,600
The stuffing of spongy chicken  is leftovers from yesterday

85
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:41,440
The maw is just pig's skin

86
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:44,080
The ham is the most precious ingredient

87
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:46,420
Is that right, kid?       Yes¡­

88
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:47,950
You're wrong!

89
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:50,350
The best part of Spongy Chicken  is the fish maw

90
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:52,690
Maw is spongy tissue

91
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:55,750
It absorbs all the essence  and juice from chicken and ham

92
00:08:55,830 --> 00:08:57,350
That's why it's called Spongy Chicken

93
00:08:57,430 --> 00:08:58,760
Am I right, kid?

94
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:00,230
I agree¡­

95
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:02,060
I've told you it's not fish maw,  it's just pig's skin

96
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:04,260
Kid, do you think it's  fish maw or pig's skin?

97
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:05,330
Answer me!

98
00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:07,310
In a word¡­ it's spongy tissue

99
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:08,240
Everybody's happy now

100
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:09,870
You'd better put a sponge in it

101
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:12,070
to absorb the juice¡­

102
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:14,340
then you can just eat the sponge

103
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:16,210
I don't want to carry on this  nonsense argument with you

104
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:17,940
Go eat your spongy tissue!

105
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:20,080
It's your ham, pig!

106
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:21,640
Here's your spongy tissue!

107
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,120
I'm warning you¡­       What?

108
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:25,390
Don't ruin my spongy tissue

109
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:26,620
Pick it up!

110
00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:29,190
You ruin my ham in the first place

111
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:30,320
Eat it!

112
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,230
And don't shit it out!

113
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:33,290
Spongy Chicken!

114
00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:34,960
Spongy Chicken! Go to hell!

115
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:37,330
Damn you, you dare break my head!

116
00:09:47,050 --> 00:09:48,950
Let's share the taxi, where are you going?

117
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:50,980
My workplace, Kowloon Funeral Parlor

118
00:09:51,650 --> 00:09:52,680
Think it's bad luck?

119
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:55,790
Not at all¡­ I do respect you

120
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:58,350
You serve the people and the spirits too

121
00:09:58,430 --> 00:09:59,890
Kowloon Funeral Parlor, please

122
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:37,690
Hi, I'm looking for  the Chief Editor, Mr. Chan

123
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:39,130
Follow me, please

124
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:03,710
Are you Luk?       Yes

125
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:06,420
Chief Editor, Mr. Chan¡­ I presume?

126
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:17,330
Hello

127
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:20,200
Cheat Editor?

128
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:25,840
Here're all my works

129
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:31,980
We must have all these synopsises

130
00:11:32,450 --> 00:11:34,790
I've the traditional Chinese version

131
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:36,350
simplified Chinese version

132
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:38,450
I've also considered the Asian markets

133
00:11:38,530 --> 00:11:40,190
The Japanese version

134
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:41,890
the Korean version

135
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,830
and English version, too

136
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:46,930
So we can send it to Pixar  or Dreamworks in the near future

137
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,490
But I read really slow

138
00:11:48,570 --> 00:11:50,730
No problem, I talk fast

139
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:52,100
Then you tell me the story

140
00:11:57,910 --> 00:12:00,040
I'm going to tell the story.  Go ahead

141
00:12:03,050 --> 00:12:04,240
This is a story¡­

142
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:09,050
with a bright and shiny beginning¡­

143
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,280
but with a dark and eerie ending

144
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:18,690
Go on

145
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:23,200
It's a story with a  bright and shiny beginning¡­

146
00:12:23,270 --> 00:12:25,530
but with a dark and eerie ending¡­

147
00:12:27,010 --> 00:12:29,740
It's a story about  the impermanence of life

148
00:12:31,310 --> 00:12:34,510
That's why everybody should buy insurance

149
00:12:58,410 --> 00:13:03,400
Mrs. Ho, unfortunately  your husband has passed away

150
00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:07,850
But fortunately he did buy  insurance from our company

151
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:12,380
However¡­unfortunately¡­

152
00:13:12,690 --> 00:13:15,420
his agent, Mr. Kwan

153
00:13:15,490 --> 00:13:19,360
has also passed away last week

154
00:13:19,630 --> 00:13:22,190
But fortunately, I'm the one  responsible for your case now

155
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:23,420
So you don't have to  worry about anything anymore

156
00:13:37,210 --> 00:13:40,440
Mrs. Ho, the death benefit of  your husband has been issued

157
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:48,820
Mom, it's one million.       Yes

158
00:13:48,890 --> 00:13:52,420
Exactly. A well-planned husband,  even though he is dead

159
00:13:52,490 --> 00:13:55,120
can still show the benefits  of buying a life insurance plan

160
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:57,990
It makes a misfortunate event  less misfortunate

161
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:03,230
My husband disliked  all the insurance agents

162
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:05,430
except Mr. Kwan

163
00:14:06,210 --> 00:14:09,140
Mr. Kwan has really helped us a lot

164
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:15,010
How did Mr. Kwan die?

165
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:19,640
He was crushed by a collapsed sick tree

166
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:24,690
(Sick tree collapsed, crushed a man.)

167
00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:28,590
You see, life is so impermanent

168
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:31,190
But there's one thing for sure,  we'll all die eventually

169
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:34,560
Buy insurance, you'll sure win

170
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:39,760
Mr. Kwan really helped us a lot

171
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:45,540
Good men die young

172
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:49,440
Like my husband, he got no friends

173
00:14:50,050 --> 00:14:53,140
Mr. Kwan was the only one  who remembered his birthday

174
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:56,990
and sent him birthday card every year

175
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:59,120
He's so sincere¡­

176
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:02,230
In fact, Mr. Kwan could have  done better than this

177
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:04,560
If he had asked your husband to buy  a plan with bigger death benefit

178
00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:06,620
and make your husband's  death more worthwhile

179
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:09,260
The two of us have to rely on  each other from now on

180
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:12,460
That's the reason you have to  rely on insurance plan

181
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:18,950
Are you asking me to buy insurance?

182
00:15:19,610 --> 00:15:21,880
I am asking both of you to buy insurance

183
00:15:21,950 --> 00:15:25,390
In case there's anything happen to you,  your son can rely on that

184
00:15:25,450 --> 00:15:28,620
Or the other way round,  you'll stilI get a cheque

185
00:15:32,530 --> 00:15:35,590
Please consider the accident  and life insurance for children

186
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:40,490
When you read the news, you'll find  so many accidents invoIving kids

187
00:15:40,570 --> 00:15:44,500
such as mistakenly drinking acid,  shampoo, melamine-contaminated milk¡­

188
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:46,870
Sudden death when playing videogames¡­

189
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:49,410
Losing their fingers by door¡­       Mom!

190
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,770
Head got stuck in portable desk¡­

191
00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:53,710
Eye got pierced by pencil¡­

192
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:55,150
And¡­

193
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:57,910
strangled by windows blinds strings

194
00:15:57,990 --> 00:16:01,180
You see, life is so impermanent

195
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:06,980
Look, there's a guy  dropped his $1 ,000 note

196
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:08,390
How unlucky!

197
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:10,560
That other guy is lucky

198
00:16:10,630 --> 00:16:12,620
There's a bank note  waiting for him to pick up

199
00:16:22,910 --> 00:16:25,570
See how he jeopardize his life just to

200
00:16:25,650 --> 00:16:27,200
pick up the bank note

201
00:16:39,090 --> 00:16:42,030
But the main point today is  ¡°Life is impermanent¡±

202
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:46,500
Mrs. Ho, there're always  expenses after a misfortune

203
00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:48,890
Excuse me

204
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:50,300
Hello?

205
00:16:50,370 --> 00:16:53,640
Sis, come over to my place for  New Year's Eve dinner tonight

206
00:16:53,910 --> 00:16:56,100
Okay¡­ I am having a meeting now

207
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:57,940
Hold on¡­ just one word

208
00:16:58,010 --> 00:16:59,640
Have you read the latest issue  of the ¡°Super Tabloid¡±?

209
00:16:59,710 --> 00:17:01,240
I know that macho guy on the cover page

210
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,750
We'll talk about this later

211
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:06,250
You bought another car again?

212
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:09,120
I bought this after contemplation

213
00:17:09,190 --> 00:17:12,820
There's a hole in the ozone layer

214
00:17:12,890 --> 00:17:14,360
Really?

215
00:17:14,430 --> 00:17:16,620
This is an environmental friendly car

216
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:19,330
Where's your old car?  I took it to a scrap yard

217
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:23,360
You took a mint condition car to scrap yard?  And you say that's environmental friendly?

218
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:26,170
Mrs. Cheung drives the same car

219
00:17:26,510 --> 00:17:28,240
Which Mrs. Cheung?

220
00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:30,400
The wife of Jackie Cheung  (famous HK singer)

221
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,600
The salesman told me so

222
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:35,010
Really?

223
00:17:37,950 --> 00:17:39,010
Hello?

224
00:17:39,090 --> 00:17:41,650
Didn't you get my text message?  Why didn't you reply?

225
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:43,550
I have an appointment tonight

226
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:46,020
Appointment? Where? For what? With whom?

227
00:17:46,090 --> 00:17:48,760
New Year's Eve dinner is tonight,  what's more important than family reunion?

228
00:17:48,830 --> 00:17:49,920
Okay¡­

229
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,590
Send me your sister's address

230
00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:53,930
Start the dinner without me.  Don't wait with empty stomach

231
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,260
Bye

232
00:17:58,670 --> 00:18:00,330
The car engine is quiet

233
00:18:00,410 --> 00:18:02,710
I can even hear my brother-in-law's  voice from your phone

234
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:07,040
Right, I've brought you  some red packets envelopes

235
00:18:07,210 --> 00:18:08,770
Gift from your insurance company?

236
00:18:08,850 --> 00:18:11,820
Now you're somebody's wife

237
00:18:11,890 --> 00:18:14,250
You've got to initiate  and prepare everything yourself

238
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:17,880
Don't act if you are still single  and needed to be taken care of

239
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:24,420
I think¡­ not too suitable

240
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:26,570
Why? You're not going  to give out red packet?

241
00:18:26,930 --> 00:18:29,930
I'd like to use those with  my husband's last name printed on it

242
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,200
It's my luck to have such a good husband

243
00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:36,770
I have adopted his last name.  He's a dentist

244
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:40,210
He's rich and handsome

245
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:44,270
I don't have to work at all,  feel like the luckiest woman in the world

246
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:47,510
I really have to thank God

247
00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:49,560
for giving me such a rich husband

248
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:52,320
Well, give them back to me then

249
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:54,650
I want them, what makes you think I don't?

250
00:18:54,730 --> 00:18:57,990
I'll use yours to pack  those under a hundred dollars

251
00:18:58,070 --> 00:18:59,620
For those over a hundred

252
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:01,500
I'll use those with  my husband's last name printed on it

253
00:19:01,570 --> 00:19:04,330
People will stilI know  I'm giving out big red packets

254
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:06,160
Right!

255
00:19:20,890 --> 00:19:22,360
Aren't we going to your place?

256
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:25,850
This is my place, I've just moved in

257
00:19:33,970 --> 00:19:35,260
Surprise!

258
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:36,860
How do you like it? Is this okay?

259
00:19:40,610 --> 00:19:42,700
It's okay!

260
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:44,680
Very good indeed!

261
00:19:54,620 --> 00:19:57,150
Wait, have you bought home insurance yet?

262
00:19:57,460 --> 00:19:59,080
Of course I'll buy it from you

263
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:00,990
It's sisterhood

264
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:03,260
Without your support

265
00:20:03,330 --> 00:20:07,160
I wouldn't have met my dentist  husband in the university

266
00:20:07,470 --> 00:20:11,600
If our family can have  a big feast in such a big house

267
00:20:11,670 --> 00:20:12,900
it'll be great

268
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:14,900
But Mom and Dad are too stubborn

269
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:17,240
They like to compare  my husband with yours

270
00:20:57,620 --> 00:20:59,550
Honey!       Honey!

271
00:21:00,950 --> 00:21:02,110
Sis!

272
00:21:03,290 --> 00:21:05,780
My husband is so handsome today

273
00:21:16,170 --> 00:21:18,190
Honey, I've told you to put  raw food on the lower shelf

274
00:21:18,270 --> 00:21:19,600
and cooked food on the upper shelf

275
00:21:19,670 --> 00:21:21,800
Will you fix it for me, please

276
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:28,340
Honey, the dinner is ready,  we can start any time

277
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:31,650
Let's wait for bro-in-law.       Sure

278
00:21:40,130 --> 00:21:41,820
Comfy, honey?

279
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:45,060
Ah, harder

280
00:21:46,070 --> 00:21:47,860
Yes¡­ right there

281
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:56,880
What are you guys doing?

282
00:22:00,510 --> 00:22:03,680
Stop it, my elder sister is here

283
00:22:05,550 --> 00:22:07,040
Right

284
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:10,560
Remember to buy home insurance  from my sister

285
00:22:12,690 --> 00:22:14,420
But I just bought it from my patient

286
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,590
Okay¡­ I'll buy an extra one¡­

287
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:20,060
I'm too busy to take your call now

288
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:22,470
Please don't leave any message  if no reply is needed

289
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:35,010
Mom and Dad are too stubborn

290
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:37,110
They like to compare  my husband with yours

291
00:23:08,150 --> 00:23:10,170
Why is your sister taking so long?

292
00:23:10,250 --> 00:23:11,770
I'll check it out

293
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:15,150
Sis, are you okay?

294
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:22,090
I'm almost done

295
00:23:23,130 --> 00:23:24,600
Is your sister okay?

296
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:26,630
She is a bit upset

297
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:30,460
You go and buy soy sauce,  let me talk to her

298
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:23,450
You've been taking so long,  is there anything wrong?

299
00:24:26,330 --> 00:24:28,820
Honey, we run out of soy sauce

300
00:24:29,130 --> 00:24:31,220
Why don't you dash off to buy some?

301
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:33,130
Order taken, my wife commander

302
00:24:34,170 --> 00:24:36,260
Let me go buy it,  I need to shop something anyway

303
00:24:41,010 --> 00:24:43,130
I'm telling you, watch over my sister

304
00:24:43,210 --> 00:24:45,010
I only have one sister

305
00:24:48,010 --> 00:24:49,570
Sis, come with me

306
00:24:52,090 --> 00:24:55,610
We are sisters,  I'll let you use my favorite

307
00:24:55,690 --> 00:24:57,450
Try taking it with you  walking down the street

308
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:59,120
See how many people  can't take their eyes off you

309
00:24:59,190 --> 00:25:01,160
By then, you shall regain your confidence

310
00:25:01,230 --> 00:25:03,960
No need. My stuff is in my own bag

311
00:25:04,030 --> 00:25:05,730
Just put them over here?

312
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:07,320
I said NO!

313
00:25:14,210 --> 00:25:16,970
I'll put my whole bag into yours

314
00:25:23,950 --> 00:25:25,280
I'm ready to go

315
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:31,820
Take care of my sister

316
00:25:38,770 --> 00:25:40,200
This one?

317
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:45,260
Excuse me.       Sorry

318
00:25:57,980 --> 00:26:00,010
That girI is pretty?

319
00:26:00,090 --> 00:26:02,050
This is the one that your sister uses

320
00:26:02,390 --> 00:26:04,150
Not the one we just saw

321
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:08,020
I mean the one that you  had lunch with in Central District

322
00:26:11,930 --> 00:26:14,230
But I won't tell my sister

323
00:26:14,770 --> 00:26:17,570
She's living in her dream

324
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:22,160
Sis, you're really a good sister

325
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:24,030
You wish her to keep on dreaming, right?

326
00:26:24,310 --> 00:26:25,840
Please don't let her know

327
00:26:26,410 --> 00:26:28,810
I don't have a dream to live in

328
00:26:29,050 --> 00:26:32,350
But I do want to sit in a luxurious  environmental friendly car

329
00:26:35,890 --> 00:26:37,480
I don't have that money

330
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:40,890
You can pull more teeth from  your patients' mouths to get that money

331
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:57,270
Drive your car over there

332
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:59,440
I'll wait for you  by the garbage bin ahead

333
00:27:03,450 --> 00:27:05,180
Thief¡­

334
00:27:05,250 --> 00:27:06,510
Why don't you catch him?

335
00:27:16,630 --> 00:27:17,620
You're nuts

336
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:19,430
Get my bag for me

337
00:27:20,830 --> 00:27:24,170
I can't. I'm so scared.  You go get it yourself

338
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:25,570
That's your wife's bag!

339
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:26,610
Hey, are you hurt?

340
00:27:26,670 --> 00:27:28,300
Your bag is inside her bag

341
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:35,040
I'm at the Harbour Drive¡­

342
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:38,180
Miss¡­

343
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:40,520
The bag is mine

344
00:27:40,590 --> 00:27:44,020
He¡­ he snatched my bag

345
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:45,450
Yes, I¡­

346
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:51,700
Maybe you'd have a drink to calm down

347
00:27:52,470 --> 00:27:53,690
Thanks, honey

348
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:03,270
Sis

349
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:06,240
Thanks

350
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:11,850
Bro-in-law is here!       Let me¡­

351
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:18,180
Hello¡­

352
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:19,730
Long time no see.       How are you?

353
00:28:19,790 --> 00:28:22,130
Happy New Year¡­

354
00:28:30,970 --> 00:28:32,370
Do you need such a big house?

355
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:34,530
It's necessary¡­        Necessary?

356
00:28:34,770 --> 00:28:35,600
Do I need to take off my shoes?

357
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:37,300
Never mind

358
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:39,140
Have a seat¡­

359
00:28:39,210 --> 00:28:40,300
Fatty

360
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:42,170
What's up, bro-in-law?

361
00:28:44,050 --> 00:28:45,310
That's expensive

362
00:28:45,690 --> 00:28:48,380
You are knowledgeable,  it's quite an expensive one

363
00:28:48,820 --> 00:28:50,720
Do you have Danny Summer's  and Cai Qin's CDs?

364
00:28:50,790 --> 00:28:51,880
Dinner Winter and Cuisine  are available now

365
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:53,390
Come on, dinner is ready

366
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:56,450
You sure know how to do wordplay, bravo¡­

367
00:28:57,800 --> 00:29:00,100
Sis, long time no see

368
00:29:00,630 --> 00:29:02,660
Look at your hairdo, you have taken  at least 3 hours to set it

369
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:04,360
Just like a noble lady

370
00:29:06,970 --> 00:29:08,670
Noble lady

371
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:11,970
Honey

372
00:29:12,050 --> 00:29:13,880
I phoned you a couple of times

373
00:29:14,010 --> 00:29:15,910
You didn't answer your phone,  where have you been?

374
00:29:19,350 --> 00:29:20,220
A little kiss

375
00:29:20,490 --> 00:29:22,850
You drank at the nightclub again?

376
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:25,750
Bro-in-law, have a seat

377
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:27,760
We don't have family reunion everyday

378
00:29:27,830 --> 00:29:30,460
In such a big house of my husband¡­

379
00:29:30,530 --> 00:29:33,330
Let's enjoy our New Year Eve's dinner

380
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:35,700
Bro-in-law, mix the sauce first

381
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:37,840
Okay

382
00:29:40,770 --> 00:29:42,260
Honey, let me do that for you

383
00:29:42,410 --> 00:29:44,170
I know what you do like  and what you don't

384
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:46,180
You know I don't like you going  to nightclub, why you go there?

385
00:29:48,950 --> 00:29:53,940
Sis, let me cook some cheese sausages  and cheese balls for you

386
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:58,320
Cheese sausages are fatty,  and so are cheese balls

387
00:29:58,590 --> 00:29:59,990
Honey, you're fat

388
00:30:06,470 --> 00:30:08,870
Honey, some people look nicer  with some extra pounds

389
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:11,170
while some people look nicer when slim.  I think you look nice when you're fat

390
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:13,210
Just eat as much as you can,  don't worry. Trust me

391
00:30:13,270 --> 00:30:14,600
Bro-in-law!

392
00:30:14,670 --> 00:30:17,300
Let me cook some fatty beef for you

393
00:30:18,340 --> 00:30:20,140
Honey, so fat and so old

394
00:30:20,210 --> 00:30:21,870
Shut up!

395
00:30:21,950 --> 00:30:23,180
Never mind him, let's eat

396
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:28,280
Let's eat

397
00:30:40,270 --> 00:30:42,200
I don't come here to be slapped

398
00:30:42,970 --> 00:30:46,100
You guys are just flirting,  don't take it too hard

399
00:30:46,170 --> 00:30:47,430
Can I pretend I haven't been slapped?

400
00:30:47,510 --> 00:30:49,480
Or I have been hit by a cheese ball?

401
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:51,810
Actually I'm starving

402
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:53,310
Shall we start dinner?

403
00:30:53,380 --> 00:30:55,240
If she doesn't apologize

404
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:56,370
I will leave

405
00:30:58,850 --> 00:30:59,840
I am leaving now

406
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:01,680
Why should I apologize to you?

407
00:31:01,750 --> 00:31:05,420
I sacrifice the fun of  hanging out with pretty chicks

408
00:31:05,490 --> 00:31:07,460
just come here to be with you old guys¡­

409
00:31:07,530 --> 00:31:09,090
That's fine with me

410
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:11,130
Right, I did drink and dance

411
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:13,600
But you don't have to disgrace me  in front of your family

412
00:31:13,670 --> 00:31:16,190
Despite you know how I hate  those nightclubs, you still patronize them

413
00:31:16,270 --> 00:31:17,740
Despite you know how I hate  dining with your family

414
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:18,400
I'm still here

415
00:31:18,470 --> 00:31:19,770
What's wrong with my family?

416
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:22,430
It's you who told me  your sis and her husband¡­

417
00:31:28,110 --> 00:31:29,910
What's wrong with you¡­

418
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:33,440
You hit my sis?

419
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:35,040
Sis, are you okay?  Shame on you for hitting a woman

420
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:38,020
Does it hurt?  Then I'll hit a man. Stand still!

421
00:31:39,830 --> 00:31:41,690
Honey, are you okay?

422
00:31:42,460 --> 00:31:44,560
You hit my husband?

423
00:31:44,630 --> 00:31:45,930
Sorry, I¡­

424
00:31:46,130 --> 00:31:47,500
That's enough!

425
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:51,530
I am gonna fight back¡­

426
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:54,160
Look at you, you just  messed that all up, bastard

427
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:55,760
You are the one to be blamed on

428
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:57,070
Bastard!

429
00:31:57,140 --> 00:32:01,050
What the hell! Are you nuts?

430
00:32:01,110 --> 00:32:03,210
Dare you bully my sis¡­

431
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:05,580
You shameless punk!

432
00:32:07,850 --> 00:32:10,150
Don't come over¡­ I'll stab you

433
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:11,780
Scared?¡­ I'll strangle you to death!

434
00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:13,850
I hate being hit in the head by sausages

435
00:32:13,930 --> 00:32:15,120
I'll strangle you to death¡­

436
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:17,290
Stop that!

437
00:32:23,140 --> 00:32:25,130
Aren't you gonna help?

438
00:32:25,810 --> 00:32:27,100
Why did you stab my armpit?

439
00:32:27,170 --> 00:32:29,610
You hit my sis¡­

440
00:32:29,810 --> 00:32:31,000
You get lost¡­

441
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:33,510
Why did you stab my armpit?

442
00:32:37,350 --> 00:32:39,380
Stop that¡­

443
00:32:39,450 --> 00:32:41,080
Blackmail me!

444
00:32:42,420 --> 00:32:43,890
Environmental friendly car!

445
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:50,060
Honey!       What is it?

446
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:52,260
Are you okay?

447
00:32:55,070 --> 00:32:56,400
You wanna attack me with hot water?

448
00:32:56,470 --> 00:32:57,990
You'd know what you have done

449
00:32:58,070 --> 00:32:59,770
Why did you attack my sis?

450
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:01,430
She blackmailed me first

451
00:33:01,510 --> 00:33:03,480
Why did you blackmail my husband?

452
00:33:03,810 --> 00:33:06,180
He has other woman, he cheated on you

453
00:33:06,250 --> 00:33:08,210
Why did you do that?

454
00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:12,650
Am I not good enough?

455
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:15,350
You loved your Hi-Fi better than me

456
00:33:15,790 --> 00:33:17,880
You are scum!

457
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:27,390
You are scum too!

458
00:33:27,470 --> 00:33:29,440
Dare you hurt my wife¡­

459
00:33:32,710 --> 00:33:34,200
Let me tell you

460
00:33:34,340 --> 00:33:36,370
I used to play a good husband  in front of your family

461
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:38,070
to give you honour

462
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:41,780
I even pretended to enjoy

463
00:33:41,850 --> 00:33:45,010
the companion of your sis and her husband

464
00:33:45,390 --> 00:33:46,980
What else do you want from me?

465
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:52,750
What did you say?

466
00:33:52,830 --> 00:33:54,760
Do you know what you are talking about?

467
00:33:55,660 --> 00:33:57,220
Of course I do

468
00:33:57,300 --> 00:33:59,790
I can say that again,  even in reverse, bitch

469
00:33:59,870 --> 00:34:03,530
You called me a bitch,  why did you marry me then?

470
00:34:04,970 --> 00:34:07,130
You cheated me and made me marry you

471
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:13,370
Before we got married, you told me  how virtuous you would be

472
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:17,570
Afterwards, all you do  is spending extravagantly

473
00:34:17,650 --> 00:34:19,950
You just keen on buying cars

474
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:23,280
Do you know how many Hi-Fi speakers  I have given up because of you?

475
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:26,220
When we get married,  your parents wanted my money

476
00:34:26,860 --> 00:34:30,390
After that, you want my money

477
00:34:31,130 --> 00:34:35,190
Now I want a divorce,  your sister wants my money

478
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:39,030
You are all thieves¡­

479
00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:41,200
Thieves!

480
00:34:41,270 --> 00:34:42,300
Thieves!

481
00:34:45,710 --> 00:34:47,580
What a nasty mouth¡­

482
00:34:48,380 --> 00:34:49,810
You eat now!

483
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:51,280
Dare you call my dad a thief?

484
00:34:51,350 --> 00:34:52,780
Dare you call my mom a thief?

485
00:34:52,850 --> 00:34:54,550
Damn¡­

486
00:34:54,620 --> 00:34:56,680
Dare you say that¡­

487
00:34:57,460 --> 00:35:01,050
Thieves¡­

488
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:05,100
Honey, I'll be gone¡­

489
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:07,030
if I don't go to the hospital in time

490
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:10,090
It hurts so much¡­       Sorry, honey

491
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:12,730
It hurts.       Go to hospital now

492
00:35:12,810 --> 00:35:15,400
Don't touch the chopsticks¡­

493
00:35:15,610 --> 00:35:18,370
Sis, wait for me

494
00:35:26,620 --> 00:35:29,780
Won the fight but lost the family

495
00:35:30,390 --> 00:35:34,260
Bro-in-law sat alone  in the house with remorse

496
00:35:35,060 --> 00:35:37,330
Could someone die in this story?

497
00:35:37,530 --> 00:35:40,020
Okay¡­ which one you want dead?

498
00:35:40,270 --> 00:35:43,130
Whoever, just trying to be commercial

499
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:46,270
Well¡­

500
00:35:47,010 --> 00:35:47,940
How about¡­

501
00:36:00,890 --> 00:36:03,980
(Fighting at the year end dinner)  (in a disharmony family.)

502
00:36:08,130 --> 00:36:10,390
This sounds more commercial?

503
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:13,300
Higher the death toll,  the more commercial

504
00:36:13,370 --> 00:36:15,560
Sure¡­ I could die too if you want

505
00:36:17,140 --> 00:36:19,760
I'll talk to my boss, I'll let you know

506
00:36:20,540 --> 00:36:21,230
Thanks¡­

507
00:36:37,590 --> 00:36:38,920
What is it?

508
00:36:52,070 --> 00:36:53,370
999 emergency report center

509
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:55,340
Police, help¡­

510
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:58,130
Someone threw bottles of  liquid¡­ from above¡­

511
00:36:58,210 --> 00:37:01,310
It's corrosive liquid¡­  many people got hurt¡­

512
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:03,250
It splashed all over, it's everywhere¡­

513
00:37:03,450 --> 00:37:05,470
Where's you location?

514
00:37:05,550 --> 00:37:06,920
IFC in Kwun Tong?

515
00:37:07,190 --> 00:37:09,120
Not in Central, in Kwun Tong

516
00:37:10,490 --> 00:37:11,920
Kwun Tong IFC?

517
00:37:12,060 --> 00:37:15,320
Do you know you'll be charged

518
00:37:15,390 --> 00:37:17,160
for making false reporting

519
00:37:17,230 --> 00:37:19,560
999 report center is for  people who are badly in need

520
00:37:19,630 --> 00:37:20,960
It's not for prank call

521
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:22,760
I'm not kidding

522
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:26,670
I'm just trying to be a good citizen

523
00:37:26,740 --> 00:37:28,640
I've joined Junior Police since I was six

524
00:37:28,710 --> 00:37:31,610
I recorded every episode of  ¡°Junior Police¡± (TV program)

525
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:33,610
Now you're trying to  defame me for false reporting?

526
00:37:33,910 --> 00:37:37,040
Neither me nor my family got hurt

527
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:39,180
I still take time to report this¡­

528
00:37:48,290 --> 00:37:50,690
Miss, can I borrow your phone?

529
00:37:51,830 --> 00:37:53,060
Isn't there a phone?

530
00:37:54,530 --> 00:37:56,430
Sir, can I borrow your phone  to call the police?

531
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:58,700
I'm now talking to them right now

532
00:37:59,510 --> 00:38:02,570
I will let the victim  talk to you directly

533
00:38:04,540 --> 00:38:06,770
Hello? Is it the police?

534
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:32,470
Thanks, sir

535
00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:33,600
Thanks

536
00:38:34,710 --> 00:38:35,700
The ambulance will be here soon

537
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:36,940
You're welcome¡­

538
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:39,200
Bye

539
00:38:40,410 --> 00:38:41,540
Aren't you staying with me  till the police arrive?

540
00:38:41,610 --> 00:38:43,210
You're a big man,  no need for companionship

541
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:44,610
You have to give your testimony too

542
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:46,080
So troublesome?

543
00:38:46,150 --> 00:38:48,640
I used your phone, they can trace back

544
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:50,720
Don't go!       Don't ask me¡­

545
00:38:50,790 --> 00:38:52,450
I know nothing about this

546
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:20,380
Hello?       Is it Luk?

547
00:39:20,450 --> 00:39:22,550
Who is it?

548
00:39:22,620 --> 00:39:24,650
It's Ling Ling,  Luk's primary schooI classmate

549
00:39:25,830 --> 00:39:28,420
It's you, Ling Ling! You're so lucky

550
00:39:28,490 --> 00:39:30,550
I won't be able to answer your call  if you call me 10 sec later

551
00:39:30,630 --> 00:39:33,330
Are you okay?       Okay¡­

552
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:35,090
Then come to my wedding banquet tonight

553
00:39:35,170 --> 00:39:38,500
We haven't met for years,  you have no excuse for not coming

554
00:39:38,570 --> 00:39:40,540
Please come to check out my Mr. Right

555
00:39:40,610 --> 00:39:42,200
Okay¡­ I will come

556
00:39:42,310 --> 00:39:43,970
I need to dress-up now, I got to go

557
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:46,530
See you tonight.       Ok, see you tonight

558
00:39:49,620 --> 00:39:51,710
Cancel this phone number

559
00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:54,080
Write this down¡­

560
00:39:54,150 --> 00:39:56,680
I've already lost my phone

561
00:39:58,260 --> 00:40:01,820
It's done. This is the new phone

562
00:40:01,890 --> 00:40:03,620
The sim card is inside

563
00:40:03,860 --> 00:40:06,490

00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:12,830
An hour later?

567
00:40:14,070 --> 00:40:16,630
Can I borrow your phone?

568
00:40:21,550 --> 00:40:25,420
I should tell my girIfriend  about the new number

569
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:29,750
I already have a girIfriend

570
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:33,730
I'm not available at the moment,  please leave your message

571
00:40:34,630 --> 00:40:37,690
Hello? Ju¡­ Julia?

00:40:38,230 --> 00:40:41,220
Nothing special, I just got a new phone

573
00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:42,030
I want to tell you¡­

574

Here's your receipt

577
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:16,230
Excuse me, please go to Kowloon City,  Yin Yang restaurant

578
00:41:22,170 --> 00:41:25,800
Hello? Mr. Chan

579
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:27,440
Yes, I'm Luk

580
00:41:28,310 --> 00:41:30,540
Yeah, I'm still waiting for your call

581
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:34,480
I just want to let you know  that I've lost my phone

I'll text you my new phone number

585
00:41:45,970 --> 00:41:47,430
Thank you

586
00:41:49,370 --> 00:41:52,000
This afternoon around  4 o'clock in Kwun Tong

587
00:41:52,070 --> 00:41:54,400
someone threw corrosive liquid  from a building

588
00:41:54,470 --> 00:41:56,840
More than 20 people were injured

589
00:41:56,910 --> 00:42:00,850
The police is now investigating  the buildings in the area

590
00:42:00,910 --> 00:42:02,780
No suspect has been arrested yet

591
00:42:02,850 --> 00:42:07,310
The police is now calling on witnesses  to phone the hotline 87654321

592
00:42:07,390 --> 00:42:09,580
Besides, in this case¡­

593
00:42:09,660 --> 00:42:11,990
there's a victim who  was hit by a hard object

594
00:42:12,060 --> 00:42:14,550
unfortunately got run over  by an ambulance

He's pronounced dead at the scene

596
00:42:23,570 --> 00:42:26,600
There's a homicide case  in Kowloon City this morning

597
00:42:26,670 --> 00:42:29,800
Two men's quarrel over Spongy Chicken  led to a fatal fight

598
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:33,140
One of them got killed by a hard object

599
00:42:33,210 --> 00:42:35,650
A suspect has been detained by the police  for further investigation

600
00:42:35,710 --> 00:42:38,680
(Argument over a dish of Spongy Chicken)  (turned into a fight!)

601
00:42:38,950 --> 00:42:40,980
What the hell! Is that true?

602
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:58,490
Excuse me, I'm getting off here

603
00:42:58,570 --> 00:42:59,700
Okay

604
00:43:01,370 --> 00:43:02,530
$58, thanks

605
00:43:03,010 --> 00:43:04,200
Here's $60, keep the change

606
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:05,470
Thanks

607
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:17,980
Come on, what are you rushing for?

608
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:25,590
Why did you slam on my car?

609
00:43:25,660 --> 00:43:26,860
I'm asking you if you are rushing to hell!

610
00:43:26,930 --> 00:43:28,190
Are you rushing to hell?

611
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:02,570
(Two drivers fought over cutting in line.)

612
00:44:18,380 --> 00:44:20,180
Hey, kid

613
00:44:20,250 --> 00:44:23,350
If you want to smoke and watch  pornography, that's fine with me

614
00:44:23,420 --> 00:44:25,080
but please don't wear your schooI uniform

615
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:26,320
It's none of your business

616
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:30,160
Honey!       Hi!

617
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:38,430
Hey¡­

618
00:44:38,500 --> 00:44:40,130
You guys want to kiss in public place,  that's fine with me

619
00:44:40,210 --> 00:44:43,660
but come on, please don't hold her breast

620
00:44:43,740 --> 00:44:44,800
Here is a public area

621
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:46,610
It's none of your business

622
00:44:51,450 --> 00:00:00,000
Hello? Okay¡­ come right away  623   -->   So heavy!

623
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:08,130
Everybody get closer, right, thanks¡­

624
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:09,500
Excuse me, you two

625
00:45:09,570 --> 00:45:11,830
You just blocked them, please stand out

626
00:45:11,900 --> 00:45:13,430
No¡­ go inside

627
00:45:13,510 --> 00:45:14,840
It's a video, give me some motion

628
00:45:14,910 --> 00:45:16,740
As I say ¡°action¡±,  then you guys walk out, okay?

629
00:45:18,780 --> 00:45:20,680
You, stand here.  I'm not standing with him

630
00:45:21,110 --> 00:45:22,710
Miss, you're not standing with him?  That's fine

631
00:45:22,780 --> 00:45:23,840
Just walk away from him  when I say ¡°action¡±

632
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:25,470
The front roll could stand up first

633
00:45:25,550 --> 00:45:28,210
Right, sit down after I count to three

634
00:45:29,620 --> 00:45:30,950
Action!

635
00:45:31,020 --> 00:45:32,150
Motion

636
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:35,990
Wedding banquet, my ass

637
00:45:36,060 --> 00:45:39,430
The bridegroom said,  only cup noodle could be ordered

638
00:45:39,500 --> 00:45:41,590
But not for crabmeat noodle

639
00:45:41,670 --> 00:45:44,360
Shit! Shouldn't hold any  wedding banquet if you are broke

640
00:45:44,440 --> 00:45:48,070
Go to Dongguan hanging out with chicks

641
00:45:48,140 --> 00:45:50,440
would be happier

642
00:45:54,780 --> 00:45:56,510
It doesn't matter¡­ Take Two

643
00:45:56,580 --> 00:45:57,710
One more

644
00:45:59,890 --> 00:46:01,550
You guess how long they will last?

645
00:46:06,090 --> 00:46:07,960
I've found a prophet to predict that

646
00:46:08,030 --> 00:46:10,490
They will divorce in 49 days

647
00:46:11,730 --> 00:46:14,320
Which prophet?       Mr. Profit

648
00:46:23,640 --> 00:46:25,740
(Chan & Lee's Wedding)

649
00:46:35,790 --> 00:46:38,550
They don't want to sit at the same table,  how could I arrange then?

650
00:46:38,620 --> 00:46:40,390
Just tell them go sit at the head table

651
00:46:40,460 --> 00:46:42,260
Here comes a guest. Welcome!       Welcome!

652
00:46:43,430 --> 00:46:46,120
I was the classmate of the bride

653
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:47,460
Please autograph¡­

654
00:46:57,280 --> 00:46:59,040
Table 9 for primary schooI  classmate, please

655
00:47:00,710 --> 00:47:03,680
This is for the bride and groom

656
00:47:03,750 --> 00:47:04,870
Cut¡­

657
00:47:04,950 --> 00:47:06,540
Sorry, the camera was not rolling

658
00:47:06,620 --> 00:47:07,880
Please do it again

659
00:47:11,860 --> 00:47:12,950
Action!

660
00:47:14,660 --> 00:47:17,920
This is for the bride and groom

661
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:21,970
Please say something nice  to the newly-weds

662
00:47:24,070 --> 00:47:25,660
Wish you guys¡­

663
00:47:25,740 --> 00:47:27,470
happily ever after

664
00:47:30,840 --> 00:47:32,100
Till death do you guys apart

665
00:47:39,320 --> 00:47:42,980
Brat! You just care to play  and won't go to washroom

666
00:47:43,550 --> 00:47:46,920
You hold your pee till the last minute,  then you give me the ultimatum

667
00:47:47,890 --> 00:47:49,760
Son, do it like last time

668
00:47:49,830 --> 00:47:52,420
I don't want to pee in the sink

669
00:47:54,500 --> 00:47:56,300
Why¡­

670
00:47:56,370 --> 00:47:58,300
Why it's not me?

671
00:47:58,940 --> 00:48:01,270
Congratulations¡­        Thanks

672
00:48:01,340 --> 00:48:04,570
I'm your wife's primary schooI classmate,  my name is Luk

673
00:48:05,580 --> 00:48:08,170
Thanks for coming

674
00:48:08,980 --> 00:48:11,380
Keep talking as if  I am not here, be natural

675
00:48:13,050 --> 00:48:14,880
You are great¡­

676
00:48:17,860 --> 00:48:22,260
I did have a crush on your wife  when we were little

677
00:48:24,300 --> 00:48:26,230
but I didn't have a chance

678
00:48:26,300 --> 00:48:28,960
What a pity!       You are the winner

679
00:48:29,030 --> 00:48:31,190
Right, where's your wife?

680
00:48:31,270 --> 00:48:32,530
She said she's tired¡­

681
00:48:32,600 --> 00:48:34,090
and she's got to change and make-up

682
00:48:34,170 --> 00:48:35,230
Welcome¡­

683
00:48:35,310 --> 00:48:37,430
Bride's side or bridegroom's side?

684
00:48:37,510 --> 00:48:40,500
I'm the bridegroom's ex-girIfriend,  so what do you think?

685
00:48:43,480 --> 00:48:45,280
The bridegroom!

686
00:48:53,090 --> 00:48:54,520
Congratulations

687
00:48:57,060 --> 00:48:59,790
Please shoot my mother first¡­

688
00:48:59,860 --> 00:49:01,130
Thanks

689
00:49:02,870 --> 00:49:05,860
I thought you won't come,  why are you here now?

690
00:49:05,940 --> 00:49:07,430
So are you surprised?

691
00:49:10,940 --> 00:49:14,500
Did you forget that  you promised to marry me

692
00:49:17,720 --> 00:49:20,480
How about playing mahjong

693
00:49:21,090 --> 00:49:22,310
I know what I'm short of

694
00:49:33,700 --> 00:49:36,530
Miss, what's your size?

695
00:49:36,600 --> 00:49:37,570
P0

696
00:49:38,470 --> 00:49:42,170
Did you say D or C?

697
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:44,610
Get a G cup for this lady

698
00:49:44,680 --> 00:49:45,970
G?       Right

699
00:49:46,040 --> 00:49:49,070
But G-cup has to go with some accessories

700
00:49:49,150 --> 00:49:50,210
Look at these

701
00:49:52,850 --> 00:49:55,790
Spongy bra pad, it's economical

702
00:49:55,850 --> 00:49:58,050
but they're too thick  for the sweaty summer

703
00:49:58,120 --> 00:50:00,720
Some customers would prefer these

704
00:50:00,790 --> 00:50:02,260
regardless of the price

705
00:50:02,330 --> 00:50:04,490
Silicon gel.       What are those?

706
00:50:04,560 --> 00:50:07,030
Silicon gel, same material  for breast implants

707
00:50:07,100 --> 00:50:08,260
Touch it

708
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:10,400
It feels so genuine

709
00:50:10,470 --> 00:50:12,370
Yeah, if you wear T-shirt or blouse

710

711
00:50:14,070 --> 00:50:15,540
If you wear strapless

712
00:50:15,610 --> 00:50:18,130
you can use the ¡°half moon¡± pads

713
00:50:18,210 --> 00:50:21,240
If you wear deep-V,  you can use the ¡°new moon¡± pads

714
00:50:21,310 --> 00:50:22,610

I'll take the combo

721
00:50:35,430 --> 00:50:38,160
Do I look different today?

722
00:50:42,470 --> 00:50:44,370
You're heavy make-up

723
00:50:44,440 --> 00:50:45,990
Look downward

724
00:50:50,980 --> 00:50:52,600
Let me introduce my friend to you

725
00:50:53,810 --> 00:50:55,010
Luk

726
00:50:56,180 --> 00:50:57,340
Marietta

727
00:50:59,020 --> 00:51:02,680
You two should play mahjong

728
00:51:02,750 --> 00:51:05,050
Mahjong can't be played  byjust two persons

729
00:51:05,120 --> 00:51:06,650
Buddy¡­

730
00:51:07,090 --> 00:51:08,150
You can't play alone

731
00:51:08,230 --> 00:51:10,090
I've found someone  to play mahjong with you

732
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:11,960
I'lI get one more for you

733
00:51:12,030 --> 00:51:13,860
No need

734
00:51:13,930 --> 00:51:15,900
Rocky, will you accept my challenge?

735
00:51:18,540 --> 00:51:19,900
Worry about losing to me again?

736
00:51:21,940 --> 00:51:24,070
What did you say, Luk Po?  You think I'm afraid of you?

737
00:51:30,180 --> 00:51:32,780
By the way, what business are you guys in?

738
00:51:32,850 --> 00:51:34,940
Why? Is it related to mahjong?

739
00:51:35,020 --> 00:51:36,750
I'm in contemporary art

740
00:51:36,820 --> 00:51:40,850
I like to meet with people  from alI walks of life

741
00:51:41,790 --> 00:51:43,260
I'm a tourist guide

742
00:51:43,330 --> 00:51:45,890
Hong Kong Kowloon¡­

743
00:51:45,960 --> 00:51:48,630
We loved Hong Kong¡­

744
00:51:50,430 --> 00:51:51,730
I'm a dance teacher

745
00:51:53,870 --> 00:51:56,360
Good toes¡­

746
00:51:56,440 --> 00:51:59,530
Naughty toes¡­

747
00:51:59,610 --> 00:52:02,340
Pluck this flower¡­

748
00:52:02,410 --> 00:52:05,250
Pick that star¡­

749
00:52:05,820 --> 00:52:08,480
I'm a nurse in a plastic surgery clinic

750
00:52:09,190 --> 00:52:10,620
I'm so scared

751
00:52:10,690 --> 00:52:14,120
Don't be scared, many people  have tried ¡°botox¡± before

752
00:52:14,190 --> 00:52:16,220
No, I'm scared of  those paparazzi waiting outside

753
00:52:16,290 --> 00:52:17,990
How could I leave here?

754
00:52:18,060 --> 00:52:20,500
Mrs. Cheung, don't be afraid.  I have an idea

755
00:52:20,560 --> 00:52:22,120
Just lie down, get the shot

756
00:52:24,540 --> 00:52:25,590
Are you sure they can't recognize me?

757
00:52:25,670 --> 00:52:28,260
As long as you put on this wig,  let me help you

758
00:52:30,740 --> 00:52:31,870
No one could recognize you

759
00:52:31,940 --> 00:52:33,670
I'll take you out from the back door

760
00:52:34,380 --> 00:52:37,070
Yourjob is kind of unique

761
00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:40,010
So you have seen the  weakness of human nature?

762
00:52:40,080 --> 00:52:41,680
This is my name card

763
00:52:42,650 --> 00:52:44,280
I've just changed my phone number

764
00:52:45,120 --> 00:52:47,350
This is the new number

765
00:52:47,430 --> 00:52:49,720
Let's meet some other time

766
00:52:49,790 --> 00:52:53,390
So you can tell me  some inspirational stories

767
00:52:53,460 --> 00:52:55,590
Who's gonna throw the dice?       Me

768
00:53:05,380 --> 00:53:06,670
Your turn

769
00:53:06,740 --> 00:53:08,870
What's the matter? Looking for friends?

770
00:53:08,950 --> 00:53:12,310
No¡­ the bride has taken  so long to get changed

771
00:53:12,380 --> 00:53:14,650
I haven't seen any of  my primary schooI's classmates

772
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:17,850
Primary schooI's classmates?  They might have changed so much

773
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:19,250
How could you recognize them?

774
00:53:21,430 --> 00:53:23,360
Win on ¡°self-draw¡±, it is ¡°one suit¡±

775
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:26,790
So soon? Are you cheating?

776
00:53:26,860 --> 00:53:27,830
What did you say?

777
00:53:27,900 --> 00:53:30,660
What? You used to play sly trick

778
00:53:30,740 --> 00:53:33,230
That's how you stole  Angelina Baby from me

779
00:53:33,300 --> 00:53:35,700
Tell me, are you thinking of her  when you kiss me?

780
00:53:36,940 --> 00:53:38,270
Who's ¡°her¡±?

781
00:53:41,110 --> 00:53:42,340
What's wrong?

782
00:53:46,150 --> 00:53:48,550
Luk Po said you enjoy watching her  photo-collection in the washroom

783
00:53:50,890 --> 00:53:52,950
This book's not mine

784
00:53:53,020 --> 00:53:54,250
Angelina Baby!

785
00:53:58,500 --> 00:53:59,550
Luk Po!

786
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:06,570
I'd like to ask¡­

787
00:54:06,670 --> 00:54:09,070
Who's Angelina Baby?

788
00:54:09,140 --> 00:54:11,300
The one that took away my bridegroom

789
00:54:11,710 --> 00:54:13,200
Peter

790
00:54:14,310 --> 00:54:15,970
Will you marry me?

791
00:54:20,220 --> 00:54:21,450
I have something for you

792
00:54:28,690 --> 00:54:30,660
You even got our  wedding invitation card ready?

793
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:32,220
Kiss

794
00:54:38,300 --> 00:54:40,790
Angelina and Peter?

795
00:54:40,870 --> 00:54:42,930
You're gonna marry that bitch?

796
00:54:43,010 --> 00:54:44,670
Why?

797
00:54:45,310 --> 00:54:47,900
I've no choice, she's pregnant

798
00:54:50,380 --> 00:54:52,850
Didn't you say she has  gone through an abortion?

799
00:54:52,920 --> 00:54:54,320
Yes, but¡­

800
00:54:54,390 --> 00:54:56,250
She's pregnant again

801
00:54:56,320 --> 00:54:59,480
How could it be possible? You bastard!

802
00:55:02,630 --> 00:55:05,930
You guys have such a  complicated and messy relationship

803
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,430
Just like entangling lines  in a relationship chart

804
00:55:13,240 --> 00:55:16,430
Miss, that's pretentious

805
00:55:16,510 --> 00:55:18,630
In fact they're trying to harm you

806
00:55:18,710 --> 00:55:19,680
What did you say?

807
00:55:19,740 --> 00:55:21,840
Tapping on someone's shoulder  when playing mahjong is bad luck

808
00:55:21,910 --> 00:55:23,880
You should watch your mouth

809
00:55:27,120 --> 00:55:30,550
AIthough it's the first time we meet

810
00:55:30,620 --> 00:55:33,450
I do understand how sorrowful you are

811
00:55:33,920 --> 00:55:37,660
My girIfriend has dumped me this morning

812
00:55:40,360 --> 00:55:43,800
Here's tissue paper, hope it'll help

813
00:55:46,640 --> 00:55:50,600
A guy that brings tissue paper along  must be tender-loving-care

814
00:55:50,670 --> 00:55:52,400
It's your girIfriend's loss

815
00:55:53,940 --> 00:55:55,470
Your girIfriend missed a Mr. Right

816
00:56:02,250 --> 00:56:02,880
Hello?

817
00:56:02,950 --> 00:56:04,720
How are you doing in the wedding banquet?

818
00:56:05,060 --> 00:56:07,250
I haven't seen that bitch yet

819
00:56:07,320 --> 00:56:10,120
I'm now playing mahjong

820
00:56:10,190 --> 00:56:11,460
Regarding you¡­

821
00:56:11,530 --> 00:56:14,660
I do have a tender-loving-care  guy for you

822
00:56:14,730 --> 00:56:15,790
Wait

823
00:56:17,170 --> 00:56:18,330
No way¡­

824
00:56:20,140 --> 00:56:21,400
He passes, give it to me

825
00:56:22,410 --> 00:56:23,740
He's too shy

826
00:56:23,810 --> 00:56:25,900
I'll text you his phone number later

827
00:56:26,110 --> 00:56:27,480
He is¡­

828
00:56:27,550 --> 00:56:31,040
a tender-loving-care young man  who brings along tissue paper

829
00:56:31,120 --> 00:56:32,410
Don't try to fooI me!

830
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:35,480
I'm hanging up, I need to play mahjong  to relieve my stress

831
00:56:35,550 --> 00:56:36,850
Bye¡­

832
00:56:46,630 --> 00:56:50,000
(A tender-loving-care young man who brings)  (along tissue paper. Phone number: 64897123.)

833
00:57:01,310 --> 00:57:05,080
6 pairs and a half! Suck! All in pairs

834
00:57:05,150 --> 00:57:06,670
Go for ¡°all pong hand¡± then?

835
00:57:06,750 --> 00:57:09,720
Are you teasing me?  I won't go for¡° all pong hand¡± though

836
00:57:10,450 --> 00:57:12,550
Dare you break them up

837
00:57:15,260 --> 00:57:16,920
Break you up!       Pong!

838
00:57:28,170 --> 00:57:30,730
Break you up!       Pong! ¡°South¡±!

839
00:57:30,810 --> 00:57:32,540
Are you kidding?

840
00:57:32,610 --> 00:57:35,770
It's the saddest time in my life£»  you are ready to claim for ¡°big 4 winds¡±?

841
00:57:35,850 --> 00:57:38,470
Are you guys trying to set me up?

842
00:57:38,550 --> 00:57:41,020
Of course not¡­

843
00:57:41,090 --> 00:57:43,210
Bystander, is he claiming  for ¡°big 4 winds¡±?

844
00:57:43,290 --> 00:57:44,810
Isn't it?

845
00:57:44,890 --> 00:57:47,620
It's not right for you to ask me

846
00:57:47,690 --> 00:57:50,020
And it'll be wrong for me to answer you

847
00:57:52,600 --> 00:57:54,460
Buddy, wait¡­

848
00:57:54,530 --> 00:57:56,760
If someone discards an honour tile  and you're claiming for a win

849
00:57:56,830 --> 00:57:58,630
then you have to  declare it loud and clear

850
00:57:58,700 --> 00:58:01,830
And, look at the camera,  remember to smile

851
00:58:01,910 --> 00:58:03,100
Smile

852
00:58:22,260 --> 00:58:25,020
Don't think about that,  just break them up

853
00:58:25,100 --> 00:58:27,390
Break you up!       Are you that nosy?

854
00:58:38,710 --> 00:58:39,770
Break them up

855
00:58:39,840 --> 00:58:42,280
Who's playing now?  May I know who is playing now?

856
00:58:42,350 --> 00:58:44,180
I'm playing! Break you up!

857
00:58:56,590 --> 00:58:57,920
Again

858
00:58:59,130 --> 00:59:00,530
Break them up!

859
00:59:00,600 --> 00:59:02,900
Who's playing now? You or she?¡­

860
00:59:15,850 --> 00:59:16,970
¡°6 stones¡±

861
00:59:25,390 --> 00:59:26,820
I'm not gonna break these two up

862
00:59:28,260 --> 00:59:30,250
¡°7 stones¡±!       ¡°Hu¡±! (Winning)

863
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:34,520
You're so cunning to have  a ¡°ready hand¡± for a ¡°7 stones¡±

864
00:59:34,600 --> 00:59:36,760
Huh? I have to pay double?

865
00:59:36,830 --> 00:59:39,500
It's lucky that it's  just a ¡°chicken hand¡±

866
00:59:39,640 --> 00:59:43,500
You're wrong, here's a  ¡°all flowers¡± and a ¡°seat season¡±

867
00:59:43,570 --> 00:59:44,870
Three ¡°fans¡±. (points)

868
00:59:47,410 --> 00:59:48,880
Lost again

869
00:59:57,190 --> 01:00:00,780
You used up my tissues

870
01:00:00,860 --> 01:00:03,690
Should you leave such a grieving place?

871
01:00:04,630 --> 01:00:06,560
Yeah, why should you stay here?

872
01:00:06,730 --> 01:00:09,720
Shouldn't let people  sow salt on your wound

873
01:00:10,130 --> 01:00:11,690
I'm here to ¡°work¡±

874
01:00:11,770 --> 01:00:12,930
What?

875
01:00:13,770 --> 01:00:16,930
You switched that off and I'll tell you

876
01:00:17,010 --> 01:00:18,030
Okay, already off

877
01:00:22,010 --> 01:00:23,540
Do you know what this is?

878
01:00:23,610 --> 01:00:25,080
What?

879
01:00:25,150 --> 01:00:26,980
Botulinus

880
01:00:27,050 --> 01:00:28,310
What an awful name!

881
01:00:28,390 --> 01:00:29,780
That's Botox

882
01:00:29,850 --> 01:00:33,850
It's used in plastic surgery clinic  for wrinkle elimination

883
01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:35,590
You have tried that?

884
01:00:35,660 --> 01:00:36,890
Kind of

885
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:39,760
But this one's been refined

886
01:00:39,830 --> 01:00:42,090
It's highly concentrated

887
01:00:42,170 --> 01:00:45,470
It could kill if taken orally

888
01:00:45,540 --> 01:00:49,560
I'm wondering in which dish  I should put this

889
01:00:49,640 --> 01:00:51,670
so that no children will be hurt

890
01:00:52,910 --> 01:00:56,780
According to my experience, children run  around after having the shark's fins

891
01:01:12,130 --> 01:01:13,600
You can't do that!

892
01:01:13,660 --> 01:01:14,860
Why?

893
01:01:17,300 --> 01:01:18,460
Let me do it

894
01:01:19,970 --> 01:01:21,870
Do you know what this is?

895
01:01:21,940 --> 01:01:23,840
Coke.       Of course not

896
01:01:23,910 --> 01:01:26,030
I drank the coke last night

897
01:01:26,180 --> 01:01:27,970
Now, it's highly  concentrated flammable liquid

898
01:01:28,050 --> 01:01:30,240
inside this classic coke bottle

899
01:01:30,310 --> 01:01:32,080
So cooI

900
01:01:32,150 --> 01:01:33,080
Is there any technical name for that?

901
01:01:33,150 --> 01:01:35,620
You know shit about that!  You failed your chemistry though

902
01:01:35,690 --> 01:01:37,480
You just know luring other's girIfriend

903
01:01:37,550 --> 01:01:39,150
Angelina Baby!

904
01:01:41,260 --> 01:01:45,020
When the time comes, you guys better  find a safe place to hide

905
01:01:45,100 --> 01:01:47,620
You must take good shot of me

906
01:01:48,630 --> 01:01:49,860
I will¡­

907
01:01:51,900 --> 01:01:54,530
Thanks for coming to our banquet

908
01:01:54,610 --> 01:01:55,830
Cheers!

909
01:01:56,810 --> 01:02:00,400
Ladies and gentlemen,  I loved Angelina Baby!

910
01:02:09,750 --> 01:02:11,780
I'm not trying to discourage you

911
01:02:11,860 --> 01:02:13,950
But I think you're so stupid

912
01:02:14,020 --> 01:02:16,990
You wouldn't be able to see it  even I've taken good shot of you

913
01:02:18,430 --> 01:02:21,060
He's always like this,  he's just up to kindergarten level

914
01:02:22,870 --> 01:02:24,360
Watch me

915
01:02:26,070 --> 01:02:28,470
Hope you will enjoy the dinner. Cheers!

916
01:02:31,780 --> 01:02:33,610
Okay, let's greet on the newlyweds

917
01:02:33,680 --> 01:02:35,170
Congratulations¡­

918
01:02:35,250 --> 01:02:37,940
Ladies and Gentlemen¡­

919
01:02:38,020 --> 01:02:40,610
Let's share the romantic  story of the couple

920
01:02:40,680 --> 01:02:41,880
Here it goes!

921
01:03:00,440 --> 01:03:02,030
It's not the groom?

922
01:03:05,480 --> 01:03:07,310
Angelina Baby¡­

923
01:03:09,380 --> 01:03:09,870
Great!

924
01:03:09,950 --> 01:03:13,210
You two, don't do anything

925
01:03:13,720 --> 01:03:17,180
No one can stop what  Marietta is going to do

926
01:03:17,250 --> 01:03:20,160
If you kill all my audience

927
01:03:20,220 --> 01:03:22,250
no one can see me  being the martyr of loved

928
01:03:22,560 --> 01:03:25,050
Your way will only harm the others  while yours will only harm yourself

929
01:03:25,130 --> 01:03:26,560
Mine will do both

930
01:03:26,630 --> 01:03:29,000
My way is most harmful. Use mine

931
01:03:29,130 --> 01:03:32,000
Bro, you should say something

932
01:03:34,340 --> 01:03:37,740
You are deploying biochemical lethal stuff,  plunging people into abyss of misery

933
01:03:37,810 --> 01:03:40,170
You are such a fooI,  kicking yourself against the pricks

934
01:03:40,240 --> 01:03:41,180
You are so evil

935
01:03:41,240 --> 01:03:44,150
You force others to  share your obscene clip

936
01:03:44,210 --> 01:03:46,610
Wicked, tacky and indignant

937
01:03:46,680 --> 01:03:49,150
Bro, I'd like to ask¡­

938
01:03:49,220 --> 01:03:52,990
Why is your pen having a light?

939
01:03:53,060 --> 01:03:55,350
You¡­  You are taking sneaky shot on us?

940
01:03:55,430 --> 01:03:56,920
Taking sneaky shot?       Let me go¡­

941
01:03:56,990 --> 01:03:58,960
I got the proof of you guys' crime

942
01:03:59,030 --> 01:04:00,930
You guys wilI have the same ending

943
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:02,560
Damn¡­

944
01:04:02,630 --> 01:04:04,430
Dare you say that again?

945
01:04:04,500 --> 01:04:05,660
I'm not

946
01:04:05,740 --> 01:04:06,790
I fxxk you all fxxking bastards

947
01:04:06,870 --> 01:04:09,000
You¡­       Damn you!

948
01:04:11,510 --> 01:04:12,910
Too shameful!

949
01:04:31,500 --> 01:04:33,260
What's happening?

950
01:04:33,330 --> 01:04:35,590
Is it on show or on fire up there?

951
01:04:35,770 --> 01:04:37,430
Is someone got chopped up?

952
01:04:37,500 --> 01:04:41,100
Give way¡­       Luk¡­

953
01:04:41,170 --> 01:04:42,070
Who are you?

954
01:04:42,140 --> 01:04:44,370
I'm Ling Ling.  Why are you coming from up there?

955
01:04:46,840 --> 01:04:48,710
(Chan & Lee's Wedding)

956
01:04:49,810 --> 01:04:51,250
I don't know¡­

957
01:04:51,310 --> 01:04:52,780
What happened up there?  Congratulations¡­

958
01:04:52,850 --> 01:04:54,210
Hope you'll give birth soon

959
01:05:03,390 --> 01:05:07,190
I am busy right now,  please leave a message

960
01:05:07,260 --> 01:05:09,260
Julia!

961
01:05:09,330 --> 01:05:11,320
Julia, it's me

962
01:05:11,400 --> 01:05:15,170
I don't know why I'm so pissed today,  all the bad things are coming to me

963
01:05:15,240 --> 01:05:17,140
I must be out of luck

964
01:05:18,240 --> 01:05:20,400
You left at good timing

965
01:05:21,380 --> 01:05:23,240
I don't want you to  get invoIved in my bad luck

966
01:05:25,020 --> 01:05:28,470
Anyway, all the best

967
01:05:33,860 --> 01:05:35,590
Julia?       Hello¡­

968
01:05:35,660 --> 01:05:37,090
Oh, Mr. Chan

969
01:05:37,160 --> 01:05:39,920
Come to ¡°Against All Odds Club¡± now

970
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:41,090
Club?       Karaoke

971
01:05:42,830 --> 01:05:45,060
It's karaoke or club?

972
01:05:45,940 --> 01:05:49,060
It's ¡°Against All Odds Karaoke Club¡±, okay?

973
01:05:49,140 --> 01:05:50,540
Boss is waiting for you here

974
01:05:50,610 --> 01:05:52,370
Okay, I'll be right there

975
01:05:54,780 --> 01:05:58,040
(A man was killed in a)  (wedding banquet conflict.)

976
01:06:11,060 --> 01:06:14,960
Boss, I've been so down lately

977
01:06:15,030 --> 01:06:18,730
My mom is sick,  I've to pay for my sis' tuition fee

978
01:06:18,800 --> 01:06:22,530
Yesterday, a boss asked me  to be his mistress for 3 months

979
01:06:22,610 --> 01:06:25,010
But I miss you so much

980
01:06:25,080 --> 01:06:27,510
So I'm still thinking about that¡­

981
01:06:27,580 --> 01:06:28,840
Then you'd tell your other clients  that you've been so down lately

982
01:06:28,910 --> 01:06:32,110
your mom is sick and you've to  pay for your sis' tuition fee

983
01:06:32,180 --> 01:06:34,280
Yesterday, a boss asked you  to be his mistress for 3 months

984
01:06:34,350 --> 01:06:35,410
But you miss him so much

985
01:06:35,490 --> 01:06:37,390
And you're still thinking  about that, okay?

986
01:06:55,440 --> 01:06:56,770
How's that?

987
01:06:58,180 --> 01:07:00,440
Louder! Clap hands!

988
01:07:01,510 --> 01:07:05,540
Louder! Boss, you sing so well

989
01:07:06,850 --> 01:07:08,180
Boss is over there

990
01:07:08,250 --> 01:07:09,580
What's up? Did you listen to my singing?

991
01:07:09,650 --> 01:07:12,450
Don Guo, you sang so well

992
01:07:19,130 --> 01:07:20,360
It's good though.       It's nice

993
01:07:20,430 --> 01:07:21,950
Piss off¡­

994
01:07:22,030 --> 01:07:25,400
Boss¡­

995
01:07:25,470 --> 01:07:28,770
What's it?       He's the cartoonist

996
01:07:28,840 --> 01:07:30,970
Hi, boss

997
01:07:31,040 --> 01:07:33,310
You are the cartoonist?

998
01:07:33,380 --> 01:07:35,310
Your look is funny though

999
01:07:36,350 --> 01:07:37,640
How would you like to get drunk tonight?

1000
01:07:37,710 --> 01:07:39,480
Brandy, red wine, women, cannabis¡­

1001
01:07:39,550 --> 01:07:41,140
We've everything here

1002
01:07:42,250 --> 01:07:44,480
Boss is asking how  you would like to get drunk

1003
01:07:47,190 --> 01:07:49,950
Boss¡­ well¡­

1004
01:07:50,030 --> 01:07:52,890
May I tell the story before I get drunk?

1005
01:07:54,560 --> 01:07:56,400
Okay, Punk

1006
01:07:56,470 --> 01:07:59,700
you should learn this,  that's what we call professional

1007
01:07:59,770 --> 01:08:01,570
Give him a drink

1008
01:08:01,640 --> 01:08:03,970
Shouldn't you thank boss?

1009
01:08:07,240 --> 01:08:09,940
Drink up.       Thanks¡­

1010
01:08:22,990 --> 01:08:25,460
Boss, I'd like to start now

1011
01:08:25,530 --> 01:08:26,390
Go ahead¡­

1012
01:08:26,460 --> 01:08:31,420
In this story,  there shouldn't be anyone die¡­

1013
01:08:31,500 --> 01:08:34,800
but so many people died at the end

1014
01:08:35,610 --> 01:08:39,040
It's a story with  a bright and shiny beginning

1015
01:08:39,110 --> 01:08:42,140
and with a dark and eerie ending

1016
01:08:43,380 --> 01:08:45,940
This story tells 4 kinds of people

1017
01:08:46,980 --> 01:08:50,180
First kind, those who  think they are being well

1018
01:08:50,250 --> 01:08:52,220
but in fact they are just too befuddled

1019
01:08:55,990 --> 01:09:00,760
Second kind, they are being well  because they are befuddled

1020
01:09:06,570 --> 01:09:07,760
Third kind¡­

1021
01:09:08,940 --> 01:09:12,740
they fail to appreciate that  they have been being well

1022
01:09:16,250 --> 01:09:21,910
Lastly, they don't know whether  they are being well or not

1023
01:09:21,990 --> 01:09:23,280
because they've never thought of that

1024
01:09:30,160 --> 01:09:31,420
The End

1025
01:09:35,270 --> 01:09:36,490
Funny?

1026
01:09:37,700 --> 01:09:39,330
Is it funny?

1027
01:09:39,400 --> 01:09:40,730
Funny?

1028
01:09:40,800 --> 01:09:41,960
Is that good?

1029
01:09:42,040 --> 01:09:43,840
Good, it's very good

1030
01:09:45,110 --> 01:09:46,970
Okay, get on to work tomorrow

1031
01:09:47,040 --> 01:09:49,380
Make your story into comics

1032
01:09:49,450 --> 01:09:51,880
Or even cartoon movie will do, right?

1033
01:09:51,950 --> 01:09:54,920
Shouldn't you say thanks to your boss?

1034
01:09:55,020 --> 01:09:56,580
Drink it.        Drink up!

1035
01:09:56,650 --> 01:09:58,550
Cheers¡­

1036
01:09:59,660 --> 01:10:00,850
Cheers!

1037
01:10:14,070 --> 01:10:15,540
Be careful!

1038
01:10:42,670 --> 01:10:45,570
Hello? Julia

1039
01:10:48,510 --> 01:10:50,560
I'm so happy¡­

1040
01:10:50,640 --> 01:10:54,410
Yes¡­ I'm gonna have my own comic

1041
01:10:56,110 --> 01:10:59,600
Hello? Why don't you say something?

1042
01:11:00,350 --> 01:11:02,110
Why don't you care about me?

1043
01:11:02,190 --> 01:11:03,880
Are you upset?

1044
01:11:03,950 --> 01:11:06,920
But I'm so excited now¡­

1045
01:11:06,990 --> 01:11:09,460
I'm gonna have my own comic

1046
01:11:09,530 --> 01:11:12,390
In fact I'm so upset

1047
01:11:12,460 --> 01:11:15,560
because I can't live without you

1048
01:11:23,640 --> 01:11:26,300
Sorry, man

1049
01:11:27,340 --> 01:11:29,570
He just sat with Don Guo

1050
01:11:31,880 --> 01:11:33,250
Nice meeting you¡­

1051
01:12:17,630 --> 01:12:18,990
Donna Dragon¡­

1052
01:12:22,570 --> 01:12:24,090
Say hello to Donna Dragon

1053
01:12:24,170 --> 01:12:25,400
Hi, Donna Dragon¡­

1054
01:12:25,470 --> 01:12:27,440
You guys should say hello to Don Guo too

1055
01:12:27,500 --> 01:12:28,560
Hi, Don Guo¡­

1056
01:12:34,480 --> 01:12:36,880
Get lost!       Go, take a seat

1057
01:12:44,050 --> 01:12:45,920
Come on, have a drink

1058
01:12:50,990 --> 01:12:53,360
Yours?       Yes

1059
01:12:58,200 --> 01:12:59,690
Has your venereal disease healed?

1060
01:12:59,770 --> 01:13:02,670
Yes¡­ No, I never had that!

1061
01:13:02,740 --> 01:13:05,770
Are you asking for a fight?

1062
01:13:05,840 --> 01:13:09,240
I'm¡­ still finding who your Cicisbeo is

1063
01:13:09,310 --> 01:13:10,470
I don't have one

1064
01:13:10,550 --> 01:13:12,670
If not? Why did you  kick me out of our home?

1065
01:13:12,750 --> 01:13:16,080
I told you a thousand times,  I was going through menopause

1066
01:13:16,950 --> 01:13:18,420
Just an excuse

1067
01:13:19,990 --> 01:13:23,690
I haven't done that with  anyone for so many years

1068
01:13:23,860 --> 01:13:26,450
Tonight, I want to do it with you¡­

1069
01:13:26,530 --> 01:13:27,790
to have finger-guessing game!

1070
01:13:33,400 --> 01:13:34,530
Drink!

1071
01:14:06,170 --> 01:14:07,400
Hi

1072
01:14:08,300 --> 01:14:09,700
Your cigarettes?

1073
01:14:10,440 --> 01:14:11,770
Take the whole pack

1074
01:14:14,040 --> 01:14:18,000
Just now¡­ thanks.       For what?

1075
01:14:18,080 --> 01:14:20,140
You praised my story

1076
01:14:21,280 --> 01:14:23,050
I say it's good because it's good

1077
01:14:26,660 --> 01:14:30,250
Someday I will name a character

1078
01:14:30,330 --> 01:14:31,590
after you

1079
01:14:33,500 --> 01:14:34,760
You know my name?

1080
01:14:58,490 --> 01:15:00,480
Fong May Fong

1081
01:15:02,290 --> 01:15:04,090
I've something to tell you

1082
01:15:04,160 --> 01:15:06,190
Can we find a quiet place for that?

1083
01:15:14,370 --> 01:15:17,930
I just want to find a quiet place to talk

1084
01:15:20,510 --> 01:15:22,980
I just want to have a talk

1085
01:15:27,020 --> 01:15:28,480
What are you trying to say?

1086
01:15:31,520 --> 01:15:33,960
I do have something to say, but¡­

1087
01:15:36,190 --> 01:15:38,020
I can't think of the main point

1088
01:15:39,160 --> 01:15:40,720
How could you be a writer?

1089
01:15:42,730 --> 01:15:44,670
I could if I'm not distracted

1090
01:15:53,610 --> 01:15:55,040
Now I got it

1091
01:15:56,550 --> 01:15:58,380
What drug did you take? You're so cute?

1092
01:16:01,050 --> 01:16:04,850
Fong, don't do it here

1093
01:16:05,920 --> 01:16:07,450
Where do you want then?

1094
01:16:08,220 --> 01:16:10,250
No¡­ don't get me wrong¡­

1095
01:16:10,330 --> 01:16:13,850
I mean, don't work here anymore

1096
01:16:14,560 --> 01:16:16,000
Do you have money then?

1097
01:16:17,430 --> 01:16:18,630
No

1098
01:16:18,700 --> 01:16:20,500
You've no money, I wouldn't be your girI

1099
01:16:22,440 --> 01:16:24,170
Then let me tell you a story

1100
01:16:24,570 --> 01:16:25,840
What story?

1101
01:16:27,380 --> 01:16:31,280
Once upon a time,  there's a little match girI

1102
01:16:31,350 --> 01:16:34,150
No¡­ should be a princess

1103
01:16:34,220 --> 01:16:37,380
But she doesn't know her true identity

1104
01:16:37,450 --> 01:16:41,150
This princess goes to a bad schooI

1105
01:16:41,220 --> 01:16:44,350
Her classmates are from alI walks of life

1106
01:16:44,430 --> 01:16:46,760
None of them are good stuff

1107
01:16:46,830 --> 01:16:49,320
The teachers there just won't give a damn

1108
01:16:50,200 --> 01:16:52,930
What they care most is not the students,  but the tuition fee

1109
01:16:54,200 --> 01:16:56,900
The princess is so lost and miserable

1110
01:16:56,970 --> 01:16:59,340
Hoping someone may help her,  but her hope is in vain

1111
01:16:59,410 --> 01:17:01,540
Until one day

1112
01:17:01,610 --> 01:17:03,810
she's met a prince

1113
01:17:03,880 --> 01:17:08,840
The prince is so nice  and willing to give her everything

1114
01:17:08,920 --> 01:17:13,980
So the princess is willing to  give whatever the prince wants

1115
01:17:15,830 --> 01:17:18,190
But, one day¡­

1116
01:17:19,130 --> 01:17:22,220
the prince turns into a frog

1117
01:17:22,300 --> 01:17:26,630
While the princess  turns to compensated-dating

1118
01:17:29,570 --> 01:17:32,700
Excuse me, I'm not  into compensated-dating

1119
01:17:32,780 --> 01:17:34,440
I'm a sex-worker

1120
01:17:37,650 --> 01:17:42,580
Then I do wish that¡­the sex worker

1121
01:17:42,650 --> 01:17:44,210
will turn back into a princess tomorrow

1122
01:17:51,230 --> 01:17:52,850
What makes you think I'll listen to you?

1123
01:17:55,330 --> 01:17:56,960
My heart

1124
01:18:03,410 --> 01:18:06,900
I guess, my wish is not that demanding

1125
01:18:08,180 --> 01:18:09,740
Do you have demanding wishes?

1126
01:18:11,650 --> 01:18:12,810
Yes

1127
01:18:23,430 --> 01:18:26,520
I'd like you to quit smoking  after this pack

1128
01:18:54,990 --> 01:18:56,550
Are you trying to mess with me?

1129
01:18:58,230 --> 01:18:59,720
What do you want?

1130
01:18:59,800 --> 01:19:01,660
I will chop you up!

1131
01:19:01,730 --> 01:19:04,000
It's occupied.  What kind of attitude is this?

1132
01:19:04,200 --> 01:19:07,100
Someone's still inside¡­

1133
01:20:01,060 --> 01:20:02,220
Mr. Chan

1134
01:20:03,460 --> 01:20:06,190
Take your time¡­ I'm going back to work

1135
01:20:10,070 --> 01:20:12,000
What do you want then?

1136
01:20:12,070 --> 01:20:13,900
What do you mean?

1137
01:20:13,970 --> 01:20:16,170
It's been so many years,  you've never given in to me once

1138
01:20:16,240 --> 01:20:18,000
If I don't give in,  would you be standing here alive?

1139
01:20:18,070 --> 01:20:19,670
You, traitor,  shouldn't say the other way round

1140
01:20:19,740 --> 01:20:21,180
I'm gonna settle this with you

1141
01:20:21,240 --> 01:20:22,540
Don't know who owes who

1142
01:20:22,610 --> 01:20:24,240
Let's talk about that inside.  Let's go

1143
01:20:59,320 --> 01:21:00,710
Buddy!

1144
01:21:02,390 --> 01:21:06,520
Don Guo has something to announce

1145
01:21:10,130 --> 01:21:16,690
I've been loving Donna Dragon  for so many years

1146
01:21:18,030 --> 01:21:22,660
Today, Donna Dragon finally  promised to re-marry me

1147
01:21:22,740 --> 01:21:25,730
We wilI have the  wedding ceremony tomorrow

1148
01:21:25,810 --> 01:21:28,140
Why tomorrow? Tonight's still young

1149
01:21:28,810 --> 01:21:30,070
Okay!

1150
01:21:32,680 --> 01:21:35,840
Starting from tonight,  your boss is my boss

1151
01:21:35,920 --> 01:21:37,390
My boss is your boss

1152
01:21:37,450 --> 01:21:39,580
We are brothers and sisters then

1153
01:21:39,660 --> 01:21:42,450
Our bosses are having  a good time together

1154
01:21:42,530 --> 01:21:45,820
We small potatoes should  also enjoy ourselves

1155
01:21:49,670 --> 01:21:55,040
It'd be frustrated

1156
01:21:55,100 --> 01:22:00,670
during the bad times

1157
01:22:00,740 --> 01:22:04,470
Losing all the hope

1158
01:22:04,550 --> 01:22:07,210
and fooling around

1159
01:22:07,280 --> 01:22:12,190
Just like a dead man walking

1160
01:22:12,250 --> 01:22:17,950
Life is like the waves in the sea

1161
01:22:18,030 --> 01:22:22,560
There would be ups and downs

1162
01:22:24,270 --> 01:22:26,860
Good luck or bad luck

1163
01:22:27,270 --> 01:22:30,970
You stilI have to live everyday anyway

1164
01:22:31,240 --> 01:22:34,640
30% depends on fate,  70% depends on effort

1165
01:22:34,710 --> 01:22:38,110
You've to fight in order to win

1166
01:22:39,680 --> 01:22:43,140

1167
01:24:07,040 --> 01:24:09,270
Hello¡­

1168
01:24:10,640 --> 01:24:13,730
Julia? You finally called me

1169
01:24:20,320 --> 01:24:23,510
Hello¡­

1170
01:24:53,720 --> 01:24:56,210
Could someone die in your story?

1171
01:25:05,060 --> 01:25:07,930
That's why we say, life is impermanent

1172
01:25:16,440 --> 01:25:17,670
Are you rushing to hell?

1173
01:25:22,410 --> 01:25:23,500
Hello?

1174
01:25:23,580 --> 01:25:27,210
(Fireworks in nightclub)  (caused devastating fire.)

1175
01:25:32,250 --> 01:25:33,190
The meal is ready

1176
01:25:34,320 --> 01:25:35,520
Give me one minute

1177
01:25:47,770 --> 01:25:51,300
But I'd like a better world

1178
01:25:53,510 --> 01:25:55,480
You just go ahead then

1179
01:25:59,950 --> 01:26:03,820
I'll leave them here,  you take this to someone who have say

1180
01:26:09,530 --> 01:26:12,520
Spongy Chicken.       One please¡­

1181
01:26:19,700 --> 01:26:20,690
Well¡­ no thanks

1182
01:26:20,770 --> 01:26:22,130
There's nothing else, just these

1183
01:26:22,200 --> 01:26:24,300
Leave that to others

1184
01:26:26,840 --> 01:26:28,610
Spongy Chicken

1185
01:26:34,420 --> 01:26:35,140
Why did you slam on my car?

1186
01:26:35,220 --> 01:26:36,510
I am asking you, are you rushing to hell?

1187
01:26:36,590 --> 01:26:39,680
Bro, my wife is gonna give birth

1188
01:26:41,490 --> 01:26:43,650
Give me one minute. We're just earning  our livings. I'll leave in one minute

1189
01:26:46,830 --> 01:26:48,230
Congratulations

1190
01:26:48,300 --> 01:26:50,600
I'm married.  Thanks for coming, have a seat

1191
01:26:50,670 --> 01:26:54,000
Granny, look here.       Luk!

1192
01:26:59,110 --> 01:27:00,970
Ling Ling?

1193
01:27:01,040 --> 01:27:03,740
You are so slim that  I can't recognize you

1194
01:27:03,810 --> 01:27:05,210
Congratulations¡­        Thanks¡­

1195
01:27:05,280 --> 01:27:07,480
Where's the groom?       He's downstairs

1196
01:27:08,750 --> 01:27:10,340
Isn't here Chan & Lee's Wedding?

1197
01:27:10,420 --> 01:27:13,910
It's such a coincidence, all three floors  are booked by ¡°Chan & Lee's wedding¡±

1198
01:27:13,990 --> 01:27:14,890
Then why are you here?

1199
01:27:14,960 --> 01:27:17,650
The washroom downstairs is packed,  so I try this floor

1200
01:27:17,730 --> 01:27:19,130
Let's go¡­

1201
01:27:37,410 --> 01:27:38,610
Hello?       Luk?

1202
01:27:38,680 --> 01:27:41,440
I'm Mr. Chan, I'm in karaoke with boss

1203
01:27:41,520 --> 01:27:43,310
Don't say that I won't give you a chance

1204
01:27:43,390 --> 01:27:45,980
Will someone die in your story?

1205
01:27:48,920 --> 01:27:50,950
I do want a better world

1206
01:27:51,030 --> 01:27:52,250
Fong May Fong

1207
01:27:54,800 --> 01:27:56,060
Do I know you?

1208
01:28:00,540 --> 01:28:02,370
You dropped your student ID

1209
01:28:03,310 --> 01:28:06,800
It's yours.       Thanks

1210
01:28:06,880 --> 01:28:08,710
I like your schooI uniform

1211
01:28:13,550 --> 01:28:16,420
Don't get me wrong,  I'm an old boy of your schooI

1212
01:28:16,490 --> 01:28:21,820
I did have 2A's and 4B's in HKCEE

1213
01:28:24,930 --> 01:28:27,520
So the legend is true

1214
01:28:27,600 --> 01:28:29,360
One has to be self-reliant

1215
01:28:30,300 --> 01:28:33,670
Try your best, don't waste yourself

1216
01:28:41,940 --> 01:28:43,210
Julia?

1217
01:29:01,430 --> 01:29:03,330
Why is there no one died today?
