1
00:01:09,836 --> 00:01:12,031
为什么今天这么多人死呢？
Why are there so many people died today?

2
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,870
(Luk: The 8319th night)

00:02:52,238 --> 00:02:53,865

一分钟

00:03:23,536 --> 00:03:24,400

是，行…没问题…
Yes, okay… no problem…

00:03:35,682 --> 00:03:37,741
是，明白…

00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:42,082
那我明天…带所有作品上漫画社
Then I'll bring all my works  to your comic books company

16
00:03:42,355 --> 00:03:44,983
请问你们的地址是哪里？
May I have your address please?

17
00:03:46,993 --> 00:03:48,722
是，IFC(国际金融中心)
Yes, IFC. (International Finance Centre)

18
00:03:48,795 --> 00:03:50,126
是…知道…
Yes, I got it…

19
00:03:51,397 --> 00:03:52,864
观塘IFC？
IFC in Kwun Tong?

20
00:03:53,766 --> 00:03:55,757
也知道…
Okay…

21
00:03:58,137 --> 00:04:02,699
1804室…至1808室
Room 1804 to Room 1808

22
00:04:03,142 --> 00:04:08,739
是，就用1806…那道门，好
Yes, use the door at 1806, okay

23
00:04:09,716 --> 00:04:12,651
是，清楚，完全…
I totally got it…

24
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:14,185
谢谢…
Thanks…

25
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:23,480
(Dinner is ready.)

26
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:35,600
(Give me a minute.)

27
00:05:05,271 --> 00:05:06,329
朱莉亚
Julia

28
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:13,609
朱莉亚
Julia

29
00:05:41,541 --> 00:05:42,633
糟啦
Shit!

30
00:05:49,415 --> 00:05:50,439
麻烦了
Damn!

31
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:53,512
真是麻烦了
I've a problem

32
00:05:54,854 --> 00:05:56,344
喂，朱莉亚
Hi, Julia?

33
00:05:56,723 --> 00:06:00,318
就是嘛，我见抽屉里
只剩下一对胸罩内裤
Well, there's only one set of  lingerie left in the dresser

34
00:06:00,393 --> 00:06:02,554
不知道是不是昨晚有个变态的
Wonder if there's a sex maniac

35
00:06:02,628 --> 00:06:04,823
趁我们睡着摸进来偷走…
broke in last night and stole them…

36
00:06:04,897 --> 00:06:06,296
偷剩一对呢
except for this set?

37
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:08,334
还是我喜欢的那对
Fortunately, this is the set I like most

38
00:06:08,768 --> 00:06:11,396
不行，朱莉亚不喜欢我这么轻佻
No way, Julia doesn't  like me being frivolous

39
00:06:11,604 --> 00:06:15,438
朱莉亚，耽误你几分钟行吗？
Julia, could you spare me a few minutes?

40
00:06:16,142 --> 00:06:18,269
是呀，很抱歉
I sincerely apologize to you

41
00:06:18,344 --> 00:06:21,745
昨天晚上我错过了我们的大日子
Yesterday I missed our big day

42
00:06:21,814 --> 00:06:25,375
可是今天是我非常重要的日子嘛
because today is so important to me

43
00:06:26,119 --> 00:06:29,020
今天这个日子会改变我的事业
Today will bring change to my career…

44
00:06:29,088 --> 00:06:30,521
改变我的命运
Today will bring change to my fate

45
00:06:33,259 --> 00:06:34,487
行呀，就这样
Sounds good, that's it

46
00:06:43,536 --> 00:06:44,366
喂
Hello?

47
00:06:45,772 --> 00:06:47,239
朱…朱莉亚
Ju… Julia

48
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,837
对不起
Sorry

49
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:52,343
我在搬家，搬好了打电话给你
I'm moving, I'll call you once settled

50
00:06:53,012 --> 00:06:55,037
你也该准备好去见出版社
You better get ready  to go to the publisher

51
00:06:56,315 --> 00:06:58,476
你怎知道我要去见出版社？
How do you know that?

52
00:06:58,584 --> 00:07:00,745
听到些，猜到些
I overheard a little and I guessed so

53
00:07:03,122 --> 00:07:05,420
你老是这样子，憋着胃气
You stilI have stomach gas

54
00:07:05,491 --> 00:07:07,482
记得要吃东西，才好见人
You better eat before you go

55
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,687
胃气向上冲，你就打噎
Stomach gas goes up, you burp

56
00:07:09,762 --> 00:07:13,596
向下挤就…两样都不好
Stomach gas goes down, you fart.  Both are not nice

57
00:07:13,666 --> 00:07:16,328
这里信号很差，迟些打给你，再见
The reception here is bad.  I'll call you later, bye

58
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:39,653
棉花鸡
Spongy Chicken

59
00:07:39,992 --> 00:07:40,959
来一笼…
One please…

60
00:07:41,027 --> 00:07:43,188
好…请等一下
Okay, just a sec

61
00:07:43,529 --> 00:07:45,997
小心烫…
Be careful… it's hot

62
00:07:46,165 --> 00:07:47,496
谢谢
Thanks

63
00:07:48,401 --> 00:07:49,891
喂，这是我的     不好意思
Hey, that's mine!       Sorry

64
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:52,130
这张才是我的
好…谢谢
That one is mine.       Okay… thanks

65
00:07:52,205 --> 00:07:53,695
棉花鸡挺不错呢     是呀
The spongy chicken is good.       Yes

66
00:07:53,773 --> 00:07:54,535
大婶，来一碟
Waiter, one please

67
00:07:54,607 --> 00:07:56,165
来…小心烫
Okay… be careful, it's really hot

68
00:07:56,242 --> 00:07:57,436
麻烦给我单子
Bill please

69
00:07:59,512 --> 00:08:00,843
谢谢
Thanks

70
00:08:05,218 --> 00:08:06,549
那鱼肚挺好吃
The fish maw is delicious

71
00:08:06,619 --> 00:08:09,713
所以说你，整天游手好闲
You've been fooling around

72
00:08:09,789 --> 00:08:11,518
平时又不多读几本书
putting no effort in educating yourself

73
00:08:11,591 --> 00:08:14,059
这儿哪有鱼肚给你吃，那么珍贵？
Fish maws are so expensive,  how could they serve them here?

74
00:08:14,126 --> 00:08:15,787
那是猪皮来的
That's just pig's skin

75
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:17,519
猪皮来的？
Pig's skin?

76
00:08:18,297 --> 00:08:21,994
吃棉花鸡是为了那块火腿
I order Spongy Chicken for the ham

77
00:08:22,235 --> 00:08:23,361
吃火腿？
Ham?

78
00:08:23,436 --> 00:08:26,530
你不如去隔壁茶餐厅吃个火腿扒吧
Then why don't you go to a steak house  and order ham steak instead?

79
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:28,470
来茶楼，点一碟棉花鸡
You've come to a tea house  to order spongy chicken

80
00:08:28,541 --> 00:08:30,270
就为了吃块火腿？
just for the ham?

81
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:31,810
我叫你不吃别的吗？
Did I tell you not to eat the side dish?

82
00:08:31,878 --> 00:08:33,869
我是叫你先吃火腿
I'm just telling you to eat the ham first

83
00:08:33,946 --> 00:08:35,937
说这么久，都不领会我的意思
You stilI don't get it

84
00:08:36,148 --> 00:08:39,606
那棉花鸡的馅，很明显是昨夜剩菜
The stuffing of spongy chicken  is leftovers from yesterday

85
00:08:39,685 --> 00:08:41,448
鱼肚是猪皮
The maw is just pig's skin

86
00:08:41,888 --> 00:08:44,083
吃火腿最实在了
The ham is the most precious ingredient

87
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:46,421
是不是，小子？     是的…
Is that right, kid?       Yes…

88
00:08:46,492 --> 00:08:47,959
你错啦！
You're wrong!

89
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:50,357
棉花鸡的精粹就是这块鱼肚
The best part of Spongy Chicken  is the fish maw

90
00:08:50,429 --> 00:08:52,693
鱼肚是海棉体
Maw is spongy tissue

91
00:08:52,765 --> 00:08:55,757
吸满火腿和鸡汁的精华
It absorbs all the essence  and juice from chicken and ham

92
00:08:55,835 --> 00:08:57,359
要不然，怎么叫棉花鸡？
That's why it's called Spongy Chicken

93
00:08:57,436 --> 00:08:58,767
小子，你说我讲得有没有道理？
Am I right, kid?

94
00:08:58,838 --> 00:09:00,237
有…
I agree…

95
00:09:00,306 --> 00:09:02,069
都说了不是鱼肚，是猪皮！
I've told you it's not fish maw,  it's just pig's skin

96
00:09:02,141 --> 00:09:04,268
小子，你说是猪皮还是鱼肚？
Kid, do you think it's  fish maw or pig's skin?

97
00:09:04,343 --> 00:09:05,332
说！
Answer me!

98
00:09:05,411 --> 00:09:07,311
总之…是海棉体啦
In a word… it's spongy tissue

99
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:08,244
皆大欢喜嘛
Everybody's happy now

100
00:09:08,314 --> 00:09:09,872
你无非想吸点汁
You'd better put a sponge in it

101
00:09:09,949 --> 00:09:12,076
不如放块海棉下去，吸…
to absorb the juice…

102
00:09:12,151 --> 00:09:14,346
吸饱了，再吃海棉吧
then you can just eat the sponge

103
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:16,217
不想跟你扯谈下去
I don't want to carry on this  nonsense argument with you

104
00:09:16,422 --> 00:09:17,946
吃你的海棉体吧！
Go eat your spongy tissue!

105
00:09:18,791 --> 00:09:20,088
火腿呀，猪兜！
It's your ham, pig!

106
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:21,649
吃你的海棉体吧！
Here's your spongy tissue!

107
00:09:21,727 --> 00:09:23,126
我严重警告你…
干嘛？
I'm warning you…       What?

108
00:09:23,195 --> 00:09:25,390
你别糟蹋我的海棉体
Don't ruin my spongy tissue

109
00:09:25,464 --> 00:09:26,624
给我捡起来！
Pick it up!

110
00:09:26,933 --> 00:09:29,197
是你先糟蹋我的火腿
You ruin my ham in the first place

111
00:09:29,268 --> 00:09:30,326
给我吃下去！
Eat it!

112
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:32,234
还有，不准拉出来！
And don't shit it out!

113
00:09:32,305 --> 00:09:33,294
棉花鸡！
Spongy Chicken!

114
00:09:33,372 --> 00:09:34,964
去你的棉花鸡！
Spongy Chicken! Go to hell!

115
00:09:35,508 --> 00:09:37,339
混蛋，居然打爆我的头
Damn you, you dare break my head!

116
00:09:47,053 --> 00:09:48,953
无所谓，我们一起吧，你去哪？
Let's share the taxi, where are you going?

117
00:09:49,021 --> 00:09:50,989
上班，九龙殡仪馆
My workplace, Kowloon Funeral Parlor

118
00:09:51,657 --> 00:09:52,681
不吉利？
Think it's bad luck?

119
00:09:53,359 --> 00:09:55,793
不…我很尊敬你的
Not at all… I do respect you

120
00:09:55,861 --> 00:09:58,352
你不但为人民服务，还为鬼魂服务
You serve the people and the spirits too

121
00:09:58,431 --> 00:09:59,898
先去九龙殡仪馆
Kowloon Funeral Parlor, please

122
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:37,698
你好，我找陈总编
Hi, I'm looking for  the Chief Editor, Mr. Chan

123
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:39,137

125
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:06,429
你是…陈总编？

126
00:11:16,142 --> 00:11:17,336
你好
Hello

127
00:11:18,144 --> 00:11:20,203
总“骗”辑？
Cheat Editor?

128
00:11:23,649 --> 00:11:25,844
这儿有我的漫画作品
Here're all my works

129
00:11:27,887 --> 00:11:31,983
当然少不了…一份故事大纲
We must have all these synopsises

130
00:11:32,458 --> 00:11:34,790
我准备了中文繁体版
I've the traditional Chinese version

131
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:36,350
中文简体版

132
00:11:36,429 --> 00:11:38,454
当然也照顾了亚洲朋友的需要
I've also considered the Asian markets

133
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:40,192
有日文版

00:11:40,666 --> 00:11:41,894

还有，英文版

136
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:46,934
预备我们将来进军好莱坞之用
So we can send it to Pixar  or Dreamworks in the near future

137
00:11:47,006 --> 00:11:48,496
我看得很慢的
But I read really slow

138
00:11:48,574 --> 00:11:50,735
没关系，我说得很快
No problem, I talk fast

139
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:52,107
那你说吧
Then you tell me the story

140
00:11:57,917 --> 00:12:00,044
我说了     说吧
I'm going to tell the story.  Go ahead

141
00:12:03,055 --> 00:12:04,249
这是一个…
This is a story…

142
00:12:06,926 --> 00:12:09,053
这是一个开头亮闪闪
with a bright and shiny beginning…

143
00:12:09,128 --> 00:12:11,289
后来黑压压的故事
but with a dark and eerie ending

144
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:18,696
说吧
Go on

145
00:12:21,107 --> 00:12:23,200
这是一个开头亮闪闪
It's a story with a  bright and shiny beginning…

146
00:12:23,275 --> 00:12:25,539
后来黑压压的故事…
but with a dark and eerie ending…

147
00:12:27,012 --> 00:12:29,742
是一个关于人生无常的故事
It's a story about  the impermanence of life

148
00:12:31,317 --> 00:12:34,514
所以人真的要买保险
That's why everybody should buy insurance

149
00:12:58,410 --> 00:13:03,404
何太太，你先生很不幸…去世了
Mrs. Ho, unfortunately  your husband has passed away

150
00:13:03,916 --> 00:13:07,852
不过很幸运
他买了我们公司的人寿保险
But fortunately he did buy  insurance from our company

151
00:13:09,388 --> 00:13:12,380
但是…又很不幸…
However…unfortunately…

152
00:13:12,691 --> 00:13:15,421
跟单的那位同事，就是关先生
his agent, Mr. Kwan

153
00:13:15,494 --> 00:13:19,362
他上星期也…去世了
has also passed away last week

154
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:22,192
不过，现在有我负责跟进
But fortunately, I'm the one  responsible for your case now

155
00:13:22,268 --> 00:13:23,428
你可以好放心啦
So you don't have to  worry about anything anymore

156
00:13:37,216 --> 00:13:40,447
何太太，你先生的身故赔偿出来了
Mrs. Ho, the death benefit of  your husband has been issued

157
00:13:45,424 --> 00:13:48,825
妈，是一百万呀！     是啊
Mom, it's one million.       Yes

158
00:13:48,894 --> 00:13:52,421
是的，一个有计划的丈夫
即使已经去世
Exactly. A well-planned husband,  even though he is dead

159
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:55,126
也可以高度显示出人寿保险的好处
can still show the benefits  of buying a life insurance plan

160
00:13:55,201 --> 00:13:57,999
令一件不幸的事没那么不幸
It makes a misfortunate event  less misfortunate

161
00:13:59,138 --> 00:14:03,234
我老公一向不理会保险经纪
My husband disliked  all the insurance agents

162
00:14:03,642 --> 00:14:05,439
除了关先生
except Mr. Kwan

163
00:14:06,212 --> 00:14:09,147
关先生真的帮了我们大忙
Mr. Kwan has really helped us a lot

164
00:14:11,784 --> 00:14:15,015
对了，关先生怎么死的？
How did Mr. Kwan die?

165
00:14:16,589 --> 00:14:19,649
他是被一棵病死的树压死的
He was crushed by a collapsed sick tree

166
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:24,690
(Sick tree collapsed, crushed a man.)

167
00:14:25,231 --> 00:14:28,598
所以说，人生多么无常
You see, life is so impermanent

168
00:14:28,667 --> 00:14:31,192
唯一“有常”的是“人难免一死”
But there's one thing for sure,  we'll all die eventually

169
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:34,562
买了人寿保险就一定会赢
Buy insurance, you'll sure win

170
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:39,769
关先生帮我们赢了很多
Mr. Kwan really helped us a lot

171
00:14:42,248 --> 00:14:45,547
好人真是死得早啊
Good men die young

172
00:14:46,285 --> 00:14:49,448
像我老公，他没有朋友
Like my husband, he got no friends

173
00:14:50,055 --> 00:14:53,149
每年生日只有关先生记得
Mr. Kwan was the only one  who remembered his birthday

174
00:14:53,225 --> 00:14:56,991
关先生一定会寄张生日卡给我老公
and sent him birthday card every year

175
00:14:57,329 --> 00:14:59,126
真的很有心…
He's so sincere…

176
00:14:59,765 --> 00:15:02,233
其实关先生可以做得更好
In fact, Mr. Kwan could have  done better than this

177
00:15:02,301 --> 00:15:04,565
如果他叫你先生买保额更大的保险
If he had asked your husband to buy  a plan with bigger death benefit

178
00:15:04,637 --> 00:15:06,628
那你老公就死得更有价值
and make your husband's  death more worthwhile

179
00:15:06,705 --> 00:15:09,265
以后我们俩就要相依为命了
The two of us have to rely on  each other from now on

180
00:15:09,341 --> 00:15:12,469
母子相依为命，就更要依靠保险
That's the reason you have to  rely on insurance plan

181
00:15:17,483 --> 00:15:18,950
你叫我买保险？
Are you asking me to buy insurance?

182
00:15:19,618 --> 00:15:21,882
我是叫你们俩都要买保险
I am asking both of you to buy insurance

183
00:15:21,954 --> 00:15:25,390
万一你有事，你儿子还有个依靠
In case there's anything happen to you,  your son can rely on that

184
00:15:25,457 --> 00:15:28,620
万一他有事，你还有一张支票
Or the other way round,  you'll stilI get a cheque

185
00:15:32,531 --> 00:15:35,591
所以你一定要考虑小朋友的意外人寿
Please consider the accident  and life insurance for children

186
00:15:35,968 --> 00:15:40,496
现在打开报纸
多少意外都跟小朋友有关
When you read the news, you'll find  so many accidents invoIving kids

187
00:15:40,572 --> 00:15:44,508
什么喝错镪水、洗发水、三聚氰铵奶
such as mistakenly drinking acid,  shampoo, melamine-contaminated milk…

188
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:46,878
打电玩打到猝死
Sudden death when playing videogames…

189
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:49,414
被门夹断手指     妈！
Losing their fingers by door…       Mom!

190
00:15:50,249 --> 00:15:51,773
被摺叠卓夹爆头
Head got stuck in portable desk…

191
00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:53,715
被铅笔尖刺瞎眼睛
Eye got pierced by pencil…

192
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:55,151
还有啊…
And…

193
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:57,915
被窗帘绳子勒死
strangled by windows blinds strings

194
00:15:57,990 --> 00:16:01,187
所以说，人生多么无常
You see, life is so impermanent

195
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:06,989
你看，那个男人掉了张一千块钞票
Look, there's a guy  dropped his $1 ,000 note

196
00:16:07,066 --> 00:16:08,397
多倒楣
How unlucky!

197
00:16:08,467 --> 00:16:10,560
那个就走运啦
That other guy is lucky

198
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:12,627
他有钱捡
There's a bank note  waiting for him to pick up

199
00:16:22,915 --> 00:16:25,577
你看，他连命都不要
See how he jeopardize his life just to

200
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:27,209
扑出去捡那张钞票
pick up the bank note

201
00:16:39,098 --> 00:16:42,033
不过今天我们的重点是“人生无常”
But the main point today is  “Life is impermanent”

202
00:16:42,101 --> 00:16:46,504
何太太，大难不死，必有开支
Mrs. Ho, there're always  expenses after a misfortune

203
00:16:47,873 --> 00:16:48,897
不好意思
Excuse me

204
00:16:49,641 --> 00:16:50,300
喂
Hello?

205
00:16:50,376 --> 00:16:53,641
姐，今晚来我家吃团年饭吧
Sis, come over to my place for  New Year's Eve dinner tonight

206
00:16:53,912 --> 00:16:56,107
好啊…不过我现在很忙
Okay… I am having a meeting now

207
00:16:56,181 --> 00:16:57,944
喂…听我说完这句
Hold on… just one word

208
00:16:58,017 --> 00:16:59,644
你今天有没有看？
Have you read the latest issue  of the “Super Tabloid”?

209
00:16:59,718 --> 00:17:01,242
封面那个港男，我认识的
I know that macho guy on the cover page

210
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,753
这些等下再说吧
We'll talk about this later

211
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:06,253
你又换车？
You bought another car again?

212
00:17:06,325 --> 00:17:09,123
我考虑得很清楚才买的
I bought this after contemplation

213
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:12,823
臭氧层现在都穿了个大洞了
There's a hole in the ozone layer

214
00:17:12,898 --> 00:17:14,365
是吗？
Really?

215
00:17:14,433 --> 00:17:16,628
这辆车很环保的
This is an environmental friendly car

216
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:19,330
那你的旧车呢？
拿去拆了
Where's your old car?  I took it to a scrap yard

217
00:17:19,405 --> 00:17:23,364
那么新的车拿去拆，你还说很环保
You took a mint condition car to scrap yard?  And you say that's environmental friendly?

218
00:17:23,442 --> 00:17:26,172
张太太也是开这种车的
Mrs. Cheung drives the same car

219
00:17:26,512 --> 00:17:28,241
哪个张太太？
Which Mrs. Cheung?

220
00:17:28,313 --> 00:17:30,406
学友的太太呀
The wife of Jackie Cheung  (famous HK singer)

221
00:17:30,482 --> 00:17:32,609
车行经纪告诉我的
The salesman told me so

222
00:17:33,752 --> 00:17:35,014
是吗？
Really?

223
00:17:37,956 --> 00:17:39,014
喂
Hello?

224
00:17:39,091 --> 00:17:41,651
你没收到我的短信吗？干嘛不回覆？
Didn't you get my text message?  Why didn't you reply?

225
00:17:42,227 --> 00:17:43,558
我今晚有约会啊
I have an appointment tonight

226
00:17:43,629 --> 00:17:46,029
约会？去哪里？干什么？
Appointment? Where? For what? With whom?

227
00:17:46,098 --> 00:17:48,760
今晚吃团年饭
有什么比吃团年饭更重要？
New Year's Eve dinner is tonight,  what's more important than family reunion?

228
00:17:48,834 --> 00:17:49,926
好啦…
Okay…

229
00:17:50,002 --> 00:17:51,594
你等下传你妹妹的地址给我
Send me your sister's address

230
00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:53,934
边吃边等，记住，边吃边等
Start the dinner without me.  Don't wait with empty stomach

231
00:17:54,006 --> 00:17:55,268
再见
Bye

232
00:17:58,677 --> 00:18:00,338
这车很静啊
The car engine is quiet

233
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:02,710
连姐夫的声音也听到
I can even hear my brother-in-law's  voice from your phone

234
00:18:04,983 --> 00:18:07,042
对了，我拿了红封包给你
Right, I've brought you  some red packets envelopes

235
00:18:07,219 --> 00:18:08,777
你公司的？
Gift from your insurance company?

236
00:18:08,854 --> 00:18:11,823
是呀，你现在是人家的老婆啦
Now you're somebody's wife

237
00:18:11,890 --> 00:18:14,256
有些事要自动自觉，做足点
You've got to initiate  and prepare everything yourself

238
00:18:14,326 --> 00:18:17,887
别像以前未嫁时候
什么都要人照顾周到
Don't act if you are still single  and needed to be taken care of

239
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:24,429
我觉得…不太合适
I think… not too suitable

240
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:26,571
为什么？你不派红包吗？
Why? You're not going  to give out red packet?

241
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:29,931
我想用有我老公的姓氏的红包
I'd like to use those with  my husband's last name printed on it

242
00:18:30,008 --> 00:18:33,205
你知道，我难得嫁个好老公
It's my luck to have such a good husband

243
00:18:33,278 --> 00:18:36,770
跟了他的姓，他是个牙医
I have adopted his last name.  He's a dentist

244
00:18:36,849 --> 00:18:40,216
有钱，又长得帅
He's rich and handsome

245
00:18:40,285 --> 00:18:44,278
我不用工作，真是几生修来啊
I don't have to work at all,  feel like the luckiest woman in the world

246
00:18:45,824 --> 00:18:47,519
我真要感谢上天
I really have to thank God

247
00:18:47,593 --> 00:18:49,561
给我一个那么有钱的老公
for giving me such a rich husband

248
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:52,324
不要拉倒，还给我
Well, give them back to me then

249
00:18:52,598 --> 00:18:54,657
我要，干嘛不要？
I want them, what makes you think I don't?

250
00:18:54,733 --> 00:18:57,998
我用你的来包一百块以下的
I'll use yours to pack  those under a hundred dollars

251
00:18:58,070 --> 00:18:59,628
多过一百块的…
For those over a hundred

252
00:18:59,705 --> 00:19:01,502
就用我老公姓氏的红包
I'll use those with  my husband's last name printed on it

253
00:19:01,573 --> 00:19:04,337
那人家也一样知道我是派大面额的
People will stilI know  I'm giving out big red packets

254
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:06,168
是吧！
Right!

255
00:19:20,893 --> 00:19:22,360
不是说去你家吗？
Aren't we going to your place?

256
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:25,854
这就是我家呀，我刚刚搬来的
This is my place, I've just moved in

257
00:19:33,972 --> 00:19:35,269
惊喜吧！
Surprise!

258
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:36,864
怎么样？还行吧？
How do you like it? Is this okay?

259
00:19:40,612 --> 00:19:42,705
行啊！
It's okay!

260
00:19:42,781 --> 00:19:44,681
好得很啊！
Very good indeed!

261
00:19:54,626 --> 00:19:57,151
等等，你买了家居保险没有？
Wait, have you bought home insurance yet?

262
00:19:57,462 --> 00:19:59,089
这当然要留着光顾你啦
Of course I'll buy it from you

263
00:19:59,164 --> 00:20:00,995
我要孝顺姐姐嘛
It's sisterhood

264
00:20:01,066 --> 00:20:03,261
要不是你供我读书
Without your support

265
00:20:03,335 --> 00:20:07,169
我怎会在大学认识这个做牙医的老公
I wouldn't have met my dentist  husband in the university

266
00:20:07,472 --> 00:20:11,602
其实我们一家人在这么大的房子吃饭
If our family can have  a big feast in such a big house

267
00:20:11,677 --> 00:20:12,905
多开心
it'll be great

268
00:20:13,145 --> 00:20:14,908
是爸爸妈妈想不通
But Mom and Dad are too stubborn

269
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:17,244
总是拿我老公跟你老公比
They like to compare  my husband with yours

270
00:20:57,623 --> 00:20:59,557
老公     老婆
Honey!       Honey!

271
00:21:00,959 --> 00:21:02,119
姐
Sis!

272
00:21:03,295 --> 00:21:05,786
我老公今天好帅呀
My husband is so handsome today

273
00:21:16,174 --> 00:21:18,199
老婆，说了生的要放下面
Honey, I've told you to put  raw food on the lower shelf

274
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:19,608
熟的放上面
and cooked food on the upper shelf

275
00:21:19,678 --> 00:21:21,805
那你帮我放好吧，拜托
Will you fix it for me, please

276
00:21:25,584 --> 00:21:28,348
老婆，东西弄好了，随时可以吃了
Honey, the dinner is ready,  we can start any time

277
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:31,651
等等姐夫吧     好
Let's wait for bro-in-law.       Sure

278
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:41,827
舒不舒服，老婆？
Comfy, honey?

279
00:21:42,701 --> 00:21:45,067
低一点
Ah, harder

280
00:21:46,071 --> 00:21:47,868
对了…就这儿
Yes… right there

281
00:21:54,946 --> 00:21:56,880
你们俩搞什么？
What are you guys doing?

282
00:22:00,519 --> 00:22:03,682
有长辈在，别做这个
Stop it, my elder sister is here

283
00:22:05,557 --> 00:22:07,047
对了
Right

284
00:22:07,125 --> 00:22:10,561
我们家的家居保险，记得给姐姐办
Remember to buy home insurance  from my sister

285
00:22:12,698 --> 00:22:14,427
我今天给了病人去办
But I just bought it from my patient

286
00:22:16,802 --> 00:22:18,599
好…再做一份…
Okay… I'll buy an extra one…

287
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:20,069
我现在没空接电话
I'm too busy to take your call now

288
00:22:20,138 --> 00:22:22,470
如果不用覆机，请不要留言
Please don't leave any message  if no reply is needed

289
00:22:33,385 --> 00:22:35,012
是爸爸妈妈想不通
Mom and Dad are too stubborn

290
00:22:35,087 --> 00:22:37,112
总是拿我老公跟你老公比
They like to compare  my husband with yours

291
00:23:08,153 --> 00:23:10,178
你姐怎么这么久？
Why is your sister taking so long?

292
00:23:10,255 --> 00:23:11,779
我去看看
I'll check it out

293
00:23:13,525 --> 00:23:15,152
姐，你没事吧？
Sis, are you okay?

294
00:23:20,866 --> 00:23:22,094
快要出来啦
I'm almost done

295
00:23:23,135 --> 00:23:24,602
你姐没事吧？
Is your sister okay?

296
00:23:24,669 --> 00:23:26,637
我姐不开心呀
She is a bit upset

297
00:23:26,805 --> 00:23:30,468
你等下出去买瓶酱油，让我跟她谈谈
You go and buy soy sauce,  let me talk to her

298
00:24:20,725 --> 00:24:23,455
还说没事，这么久啊
You've been taking so long,  is there anything wrong?

299
00:24:26,331 --> 00:24:28,822
老婆，酱油刚刚用完
Honey, we run out of soy sauce

300
00:24:29,134 --> 00:24:31,227
你还不快去买？
Why don't you dash off to buy some?

301
00:24:31,303 --> 00:24:33,134
遵命，老婆大人
Order taken, my wife commander

302
00:24:34,172 --> 00:24:36,265
我去买吧，反正我也要买点东西
Let me go buy it,  I need to shop something anyway

303
00:24:41,012 --> 00:24:43,139
我告诉你，记着看住我姐姐
I'm telling you, watch over my sister

304
00:24:43,215 --> 00:24:45,012
我就只有一个姐姐
I only have one sister

305
00:24:48,019 --> 00:24:49,577
姐，跟我过来
Sis, come with me

306
00:24:52,090 --> 00:24:55,617
一辈子姐妹俩，我借我的命根子给你
We are sisters,  I'll let you use my favorite

307
00:24:55,694 --> 00:24:57,457
你试拿着它出去转个圈
Try taking it with you  walking down the street

308
00:24:57,529 --> 00:24:59,121
看有多少人看着你
See how many people  can't take their eyes off you

309
00:24:59,197 --> 00:25:01,165
届时你的自信心肯定都回来
By then, you shall regain your confidence

310
00:25:01,233 --> 00:25:03,963
不用了，我的东西都在我手袋里
No need. My stuff is in my own bag

311
00:25:04,035 --> 00:25:05,730
你把东西放过来不就行了？
Just put them over here?

312
00:25:05,804 --> 00:25:07,328
我都说不用了！
I said NO!

313
00:25:14,212 --> 00:25:16,976
整个袋子放进去就行了
I'll put my whole bag into yours

314
00:25:23,955 --> 00:25:25,286
可以了
I'm ready to go

315
00:25:30,028 --> 00:25:31,825
看住我姐姐呀
Take care of my sister

316
00:25:38,770 --> 00:25:40,203
是不是这个？
This one?

317
00:25:43,241 --> 00:25:45,266
请让一让     对不起
Excuse me.       Sorry

318
00:25:57,989 --> 00:26:00,014
那女的挺漂亮吧？
That girI is pretty?

319
00:26:00,091 --> 00:26:02,059
这是你妹妹用的那种
This is the one that your sister uses

320
00:26:02,394 --> 00:26:04,157
我不是说刚才那个
Not the one we just saw

321
00:26:04,229 --> 00:26:08,029
我是说那天在中环看见
跟你吃午饭的那个
I mean the one that you  had lunch with in Central District

322
00:26:11,937 --> 00:26:14,235
不过，我不会告诉我妹妹
But I won't tell my sister

323
00:26:14,773 --> 00:26:17,571
她觉得自己活在一个美梦里
She's living in her dream

324
00:26:19,644 --> 00:26:22,169
姐，你真是一个好姐姐
Sis, you're really a good sister

325
00:26:22,447 --> 00:26:24,039
你也想让她继续做梦，对吧？
You wish her to keep on dreaming, right?

326
00:26:24,316 --> 00:26:25,840
最要紧是别让她知道
Please don't let her know

327
00:26:26,418 --> 00:26:28,818
我就不能活在美梦里了
I don't have a dream to live in

328
00:26:29,054 --> 00:26:32,353
不过我也很想坐在环保豪华房车里
But I do want to sit in a luxurious  environmental friendly car

329
00:26:35,894 --> 00:26:37,486
我哪有那么多闲钱呀！
I don't have that money

330
00:26:37,562 --> 00:26:40,895
你帮人多剥几只牙，不就有闲钱了
You can pull more teeth from  your patients' mouths to get that money

331
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:57,270
你去把车开过来
Drive your car over there

332
00:26:57,449 --> 00:26:59,440
我在前面垃圾桶等你
I'll wait for you  by the garbage bin ahead

333
00:27:03,455 --> 00:27:05,184
抢东西呀…
Thief…

334
00:27:05,256 --> 00:27:06,518
还不追
Why don't you catch him?

335
00:27:16,635 --> 00:27:17,624
神经病呀你
You're nuts

336
00:27:17,702 --> 00:27:19,431
快帮我捡回手袋
Get my bag for me

337
00:27:20,839 --> 00:27:24,172
我不行，我好怕，你自己去拿吧
I can't. I'm so scared.  You go get it yourself

338
00:27:24,242 --> 00:27:25,573
那手袋是你老婆的！
That's your wife's bag!

339
00:27:25,644 --> 00:27:26,611
你没事吧？
Hey, are you hurt?

340
00:27:26,678 --> 00:27:28,305
你的手袋也在里面呀
Your bag is inside her bag

341
00:27:32,884 --> 00:27:35,045
我现在在港湾径…
I'm at the Harbour Drive…

342
00:27:36,287 --> 00:27:38,187
小姐…
Miss…

343
00:27:39,224 --> 00:27:40,521
手袋是我的
The bag is mine

344
00:27:40,592 --> 00:27:44,028
他…抢…手袋是我的
He… he snatched my bag

345
00:27:44,329 --> 00:27:45,455
是，我在…
Yes, I…

346
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:51,701
不如…你们快喝点东西定定神
Maybe you'd have a drink to calm down

347
00:27:52,470 --> 00:27:53,698
谢谢老婆
Thanks, honey

348
00:28:02,247 --> 00:28:03,271
姐姐
Sis

349
00:28:04,849 --> 00:28:06,248
谢谢
Thanks

350
00:28:09,888 --> 00:28:11,856
姐夫来啦     让我来…
Bro-in-law is here!       Let me…

351
00:28:16,127 --> 00:28:18,186
喂…
Hello…

352
00:28:18,263 --> 00:28:19,730
很久没见啦     你好…
Long time no see.       How are you?

353
00:28:19,798 --> 00:28:22,130
新年快乐…
Happy New Year…

354
00:28:30,975 --> 00:28:32,374
要不要住这么大的房子呀？
Do you need such a big house?

355
00:28:32,444 --> 00:28:34,537
要的…      要吧？
It's necessary…        Necessary?

356
00:28:34,779 --> 00:28:35,609
要不要脱鞋子？
Do I need to take off my shoes?

357
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:37,307
无所谓，随你喜欢吧
Never mind

358
00:28:37,382 --> 00:28:39,145
过来坐…
Have a seat…

359
00:28:39,217 --> 00:28:40,309
胖子
Fatty

360
00:28:41,086 --> 00:28:42,178
怎样，姐夫？
What's up, bro-in-law?

361
00:28:44,055 --> 00:28:45,317
这部很贵呀
That's expensive

362
00:28:45,690 --> 00:28:48,386
姐夫识货，这套东西是挺贵的
You are knowledgeable,  it's quite an expensive one

363
00:28:48,827 --> 00:28:50,727
有没有夏韶声、蔡琴的唱片？
Do you have Danny Summer's  and Cai Qin's CDs?

364
00:28:50,795 --> 00:28:51,887
菜就有得吃
Dinner Winter and Cuisine  are available now

365
00:28:51,963 --> 00:28:53,396
来呀，过来吃饭吧
Come on, dinner is ready

366
00:28:53,465 --> 00:28:56,457
咬文嚼字，好样的…
You sure know how to do wordplay, bravo…

367
00:28:57,802 --> 00:29:00,100
妹妹，好久不见了
Sis, long time no see

368
00:29:00,638 --> 00:29:02,663
瞧你的头，至少要弄三小时
Look at your hairdo, you have taken  at least 3 hours to set it

369
00:29:02,741 --> 00:29:04,368
像个贵妇一样
Just like a noble lady

370
00:29:06,978 --> 00:29:08,673
贵妇呀
Noble lady

371
00:29:10,648 --> 00:29:11,979
老婆
Honey

372
00:29:12,050 --> 00:29:13,881
打了好几次
I phoned you a couple of times

373
00:29:14,018 --> 00:29:15,918
不接电话，去哪呀你？
You didn't answer your phone,  where have you been?

374
00:29:19,357 --> 00:29:20,221
亲一下
A little kiss

375
00:29:20,492 --> 00:29:22,858
浑身酒气，又去跳舞？
You drank at the nightclub again?

376
00:29:24,129 --> 00:29:25,756
姐夫，坐吧
Bro-in-law, have a seat

377
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:27,764
难得我们一家人
We don't have family reunion everyday

378
00:29:27,832 --> 00:29:30,460
在我老公买的这个大房子里…
In such a big house of my husband…

379
00:29:30,535 --> 00:29:33,333
当然要开开心心吃团年饭嘛
Let's enjoy our New Year Eve's dinner

380
00:29:33,404 --> 00:29:35,702
对了，姐夫，先混酱吧
Bro-in-law, mix the sauce first

381
00:29:36,441 --> 00:29:37,840
好啊
Okay

382
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:42,269
老婆，我帮你混
Honey, let me do that for you

383
00:29:42,413 --> 00:29:44,176
我最知道你喜欢啥，不喜欢啥
I know what you do like  and what you don't

384
00:29:44,249 --> 00:29:46,183
你明知我不喜欢，还去跳舞？
You know I don't like you going  to nightclub, why you go there?

385
00:29:48,953 --> 00:29:53,947
姐，我帮你烫你最喜欢
吃的芝士肠和芝士丸
Sis, let me cook some cheese sausages  and cheese balls for you

386
00:29:55,126 --> 00:29:58,323
芝士肠好肥呀，芝士丸也很肥的
Cheese sausages are fatty,  and so are cheese balls

387
00:29:58,596 --> 00:29:59,995
老婆，你也很胖呀
Honey, you're fat

388
00:30:06,471 --> 00:30:08,871
老婆，有的人胖就好看点
Honey, some people look nicer  with some extra pounds

389
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:11,170
有的人瘦好看，我就觉得你胖好看
while some people look nicer when slim.  I think you look nice when you're fat

390
00:30:11,242 --> 00:30:13,210
所以多吃点，尽量吃，相信我别怕
Just eat as much as you can,  don't worry. Trust me

391
00:30:13,278 --> 00:30:14,609
姐夫！
Bro-in-law!

392
00:30:14,679 --> 00:30:17,307
不如我烫点肥牛肉给你吧
Let me cook some fatty beef for you

393
00:30:18,349 --> 00:30:20,146
老婆，又肥又老呀
Honey, so fat and so old

394
00:30:20,218 --> 00:30:21,879
你闭嘴！
Shut up!

395
00:30:21,953 --> 00:30:23,181
不用理他，我们吃
Never mind him, let's eat

396
00:30:26,958 --> 00:30:28,289
我们吃吧
Let's eat

397
00:30:40,271 --> 00:30:42,205
我到这儿不是来吃你耳光的
I don't come here to be slapped

398
00:30:42,974 --> 00:30:46,102
你们夫妻俩耍花枪，别放在心上
You guys are just flirting,  don't take it too hard

399
00:30:46,177 --> 00:30:47,439
不放在心上，放哪里？
Can I pretend I haven't been slapped?

400
00:30:47,512 --> 00:30:49,480
放芝士丸里面好吗？
Or I have been hit by a cheese ball?

401
00:30:49,881 --> 00:30:51,815
其实我已经饿极了
Actually I'm starving

402
00:30:51,883 --> 00:30:53,316
不如大家先吃吧，好不好？
Shall we start dinner?

403
00:30:53,384 --> 00:30:55,249
一句话，如果她不向我道歉
If she doesn't apologize

404
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:56,378
我现在立刻走！
I will leave

405
00:30:58,857 --> 00:30:59,846
我立刻就走！
I am leaving now

406
00:30:59,924 --> 00:31:01,687
为什么我要向你道歉？
Why should I apologize to you?

407
00:31:01,759 --> 00:31:05,422
我刚才跟一帮少女
喝酒跳舞，开心得很
I sacrifice the fun of  hanging out with pretty chicks

408
00:31:05,496 --> 00:31:07,464
现在跟你们这帮老东西在这磨时间
just come here to be with you old guys…

409
00:31:07,532 --> 00:31:09,090
我都不计较了
That's fine with me

410
00:31:09,167 --> 00:31:11,135
没错，我喝酒跳舞是不对
Right, I did drink and dance

411
00:31:11,202 --> 00:31:13,602
你也不用在你妹妹
和妹夫面前落我面子
But you don't have to disgrace me  in front of your family

412
00:31:13,671 --> 00:31:16,196
我最讨厌就是你
明知我不喜欢，还去跳舞
Despite you know how I hate  those nightclubs, you still patronize them

413
00:31:16,274 --> 00:31:17,741
你也明知我不喜欢跟你家人一起吃饭
Despite you know how I hate  dining with your family

414
00:31:17,809 --> 00:31:18,400
可我还是来了
I'm still here

415
00:31:18,476 --> 00:31:19,773
我家人有什么问题？
What's wrong with my family?

416
00:31:19,844 --> 00:31:22,438
是你自己跟我说你妹妹和妹夫…
It's you who told me  your sis and her husband…

417
00:31:28,119 --> 00:31:29,916
你搞什么呀…
What's wrong with you…

418
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:33,448
你打我姐！
You hit my sis?

419
00:31:33,524 --> 00:31:35,048
姐，你怎样？
打女人不是男人所为
Sis, are you okay?  Shame on you for hitting a woman

420
00:31:35,126 --> 00:31:38,027
痛吗？
那我就打男人，站住
Does it hurt?  Then I'll hit a man. Stand still!

421
00:31:39,831 --> 00:31:41,696
老公，你怎样？
Honey, are you okay?

422
00:31:42,467 --> 00:31:44,560
你打我老公！
You hit my husband?

423
00:31:44,636 --> 00:31:45,933
不好意思，我…
Sorry, I…

424
00:31:46,137 --> 00:31:47,502
够啦！
That's enough!

425
00:31:49,507 --> 00:31:51,532
我还手啦…
I am gonna fight back…

426
00:31:51,609 --> 00:31:54,169
你看你，搞得人家不得安宁，混蛋！
Look at you, you just  messed that all up, bastard

427
00:31:54,245 --> 00:31:55,769
最坏是你这个臭婆娘！
You are the one to be blamed on

428
00:31:55,847 --> 00:31:57,075
混蛋！
Bastard!

429
00:31:57,148 --> 00:32:01,050
你把东西扔向我？你吃错菜啦！
What the hell! Are you nuts?

430
00:32:01,119 --> 00:32:03,212
你欺负我姐姐…
Dare you bully my sis…

431
00:32:03,288 --> 00:32:05,586
不知好歹的东西！
You shameless punk!

432
00:32:07,859 --> 00:32:10,157
你别过来…我捅死你！
Don't come over… I'll stab you

433
00:32:10,228 --> 00:32:11,786
怕了吧…我掐死你呀！
Scared?… I'll strangle you to death!

434
00:32:11,863 --> 00:32:13,854
我最恨人用芝士肠扔我的头！
I hate being hit in the head by sausages

435
00:32:13,932 --> 00:32:15,126
我掐死你…
I'll strangle you to death…

436
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:17,290
你住手！
Stop that!

437
00:32:23,141 --> 00:32:25,132
还不帮忙
Aren't you gonna help?

438
00:32:25,810 --> 00:32:27,107
你干嘛插我腋窝？
Why did you stab my armpit?

439
00:32:27,178 --> 00:32:29,612
打我姐姐…
You hit my sis…

440
00:32:29,814 --> 00:32:31,008
你滚开呀…
You get lost…

441
00:32:31,082 --> 00:32:33,516
你干嘛插我腋窝？
Why did you stab my armpit?

442
00:32:37,355 --> 00:32:39,380
够啦…你干嘛…
Stop that…

443
00:32:39,457 --> 00:32:41,084
勒索我？
Blackmail me!

444
00:32:42,427 --> 00:32:43,894
环保车！
Environmental friendly car!

445
00:32:47,665 --> 00:32:50,065
老婆！     干什么？
Honey!       What is it?

446
00:32:50,902 --> 00:32:52,267
你没事吧？
Are you okay?

447
00:32:55,073 --> 00:32:56,404
你想泼我？
You wanna attack me with hot water?

448
00:32:56,474 --> 00:32:57,998
你心知肚明
You'd know what you have done

449
00:32:58,076 --> 00:32:59,771
你干嘛要泼我姐？
Why did you attack my sis?

450
00:32:59,844 --> 00:33:01,436
是她先勒索我
She blackmailed me first

451
00:33:01,512 --> 00:33:03,480
你干嘛勒索我老公？
Why did you blackmail my husband?

452
00:33:03,815 --> 00:33:06,181
他在外面有女人呀，你还蒙在鼓里
He has other woman, he cheated on you

453
00:33:06,250 --> 00:33:08,218
你在外面干嘛有女人呀？
Why did you do that?

454
00:33:10,822 --> 00:33:12,653
是不是我不够好？
Am I not good enough?

455
00:33:12,724 --> 00:33:15,352
你疼音响多过疼我
You loved your Hi-Fi better than me

456
00:33:15,793 --> 00:33:17,886
你不是人！
You are scum!

457
00:33:25,403 --> 00:33:27,394
你才不是人！
You are scum too!

458
00:33:27,472 --> 00:33:29,440
搞我老婆…
Dare you hurt my wife…

459
00:33:32,710 --> 00:33:34,200
我老实告诉你
Let me tell you

460
00:33:34,345 --> 00:33:36,370
我平时已经在人家面前做足戏
I used to play a good husband  in front of your family

461
00:33:36,447 --> 00:33:38,074
给足你面子了
to give you honour

462
00:33:38,449 --> 00:33:41,782
我今天还在你姐、你姐夫…
I even pretended to enjoy

463
00:33:41,853 --> 00:33:45,016
在这种跑龙套的闲人面前做足戏
the companion of your sis and her husband

464
00:33:45,390 --> 00:33:46,982
你还想我怎样？
What else do you want from me?

465
00:33:51,162 --> 00:33:52,754
你说什么？
What did you say?

466
00:33:52,830 --> 00:33:54,764
你知不知道自己在说什么？
Do you know what you are talking about?

467
00:33:55,666 --> 00:33:57,224
我当然知道我说什么
Of course I do

468
00:33:57,301 --> 00:33:59,792
我倒过来再说一次也行呀，臭婆娘！
I can say that again,  even in reverse, bitch

469
00:33:59,871 --> 00:34:03,534
你骂我臭婆娘，那你还娶我？
You called me a bitch,  why did you marry me then?

470
00:34:04,976 --> 00:34:07,137
是你骗我娶你的
You cheated me and made me marry you

471
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:13,376
结婚前，你说自己多么贤淑
Before we got married, you told me  how virtuous you would be

472
00:34:14,018 --> 00:34:17,579
结婚后，我才知道你挥霍无度
Afterwards, all you do  is spending extravagantly

473
00:34:17,655 --> 00:34:19,953
一天都晚就是买车买车
You just keen on buying cars

474
00:34:20,124 --> 00:34:23,287
为了你，我少买了多少套喇叭！
Do you know how many Hi-Fi speakers  I have given up because of you?

475
00:34:23,361 --> 00:34:26,228
结婚时，你爸爸妈妈谋我
When we get married,  your parents wanted my money

476
00:34:26,864 --> 00:34:30,391
结了婚…你谋我
After that, you want my money

477
00:34:31,135 --> 00:34:35,196
现在我想离婚，连你姐也来谋我
Now I want a divorce,  your sister wants my money

478
00:34:36,007 --> 00:34:39,033
全家都是贼，都是贼…
You are all thieves…

479
00:34:39,544 --> 00:34:41,205
都是贼！
Thieves!

480
00:34:41,279 --> 00:34:42,303
贼！
Thieves!

481
00:34:45,716 --> 00:34:47,581
臭嘴巴…
What a nasty mouth…

482
00:34:48,386 --> 00:34:49,819
吃死你呀！
You eat now!

483
00:34:49,887 --> 00:34:51,286
骂我爸爸！
Dare you call my dad a thief?

484
00:34:51,355 --> 00:34:52,788
骂我妈妈！
Dare you call my mom a thief?

485
00:34:52,857 --> 00:34:54,552
骂…
Damn…

486
00:34:54,625 --> 00:34:56,684
看你还骂…
Dare you say that…

487
00:34:57,462 --> 00:35:01,057
都是贼…
Thieves…

488
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:05,101
老婆，我再不去医院…
Honey, I'll be gone…

489
00:35:05,169 --> 00:35:07,034
我真的会完蛋了
if I don't go to the hospital in time

490
00:35:07,605 --> 00:35:10,096
好痛…      对不起，老公
It hurts so much…       Sorry, honey

491
00:35:11,042 --> 00:35:12,737
好痛啊     马上去医院
It hurts.       Go to hospital now

492
00:35:12,810 --> 00:35:15,404
别动筷子…
Don't touch the chopsticks…

493
00:35:15,613 --> 00:35:18,377
等我，姐姐！
Sis, wait for me

494
00:35:26,624 --> 00:35:29,787
赢了一场架，输掉一个家
Won the fight but lost the family

495
00:35:30,394 --> 00:35:34,262
妹夫悔不当初，一个人在房子坐
Bro-in-law sat alone  in the house with remorse

496
00:35:35,066 --> 00:35:37,330
这故事…可不可以有人死？
Could someone die in this story?

497
00:35:37,535 --> 00:35:40,026
行…你想要谁死？
Okay… which one you want dead?

498
00:35:40,271 --> 00:35:43,138
总之找个人死，商业点嘛
Whoever, just trying to be commercial

499
00:35:44,942 --> 00:35:46,273
这个嘛…
Well…

500
00:35:47,011 --> 00:35:47,943
不如…
How about…

501
00:36:00,890 --> 00:36:03,980
(Fighting at the year end dinner)  (in a disharmony family.)

502
00:36:08,132 --> 00:36:10,396
这个结局是不是较商业化呢？
This sounds more commercial?

503
00:36:10,468 --> 00:36:13,301
总之，越多人死就越商业化
Higher the death toll,  the more commercial

504
00:36:13,371 --> 00:36:15,566
行…要我死也行
Sure… I could die too if you want

505
00:36:17,141 --> 00:36:19,769
我跟大老板谈谈，再通知你
I'll talk to my boss, I'll let you know

506
00:36:20,545 --> 00:36:21,239
谢谢…
Thanks…

507
00:36:37,595 --> 00:36:38,926
什么来的？
What is it?

508
00:36:52,076 --> 00:36:53,373
999报案中心
999 emergency report center

509
00:36:53,444 --> 00:36:55,344
员警，救命…
Police, help…

510
00:36:55,646 --> 00:36:58,137
很高…有人扔东西下来…
Someone threw bottles of  liquid… from above…

511
00:36:58,216 --> 00:37:01,310
是腐蚀性液体…溅中好多人
It's corrosive liquid…  many people got hurt…

512
00:37:01,385 --> 00:37:03,250
一滩滩…满地一滩滩…
It splashed all over, it's everywhere…

513
00:37:03,454 --> 00:37:05,479
先生，请问你现在位置哪里？
Where's you location?

514
00:37:05,556 --> 00:37:06,921
IFC
IFC in Kwun Tong?

515
00:37:07,191 --> 00:37:09,125
不是中环，是观塘
Not in Central, in Kwun Tong

516
00:37:10,494 --> 00:37:11,927
观塘IFC？
Kwun Tong IFC?

517
00:37:12,063 --> 00:37:15,328
先生，知不知道打电话
来报案中心开玩笑
Do you know you'll be charged

518
00:37:15,399 --> 00:37:17,162
你会被控报假案的
for making false reporting

519
00:37:17,235 --> 00:37:19,567
还有，999报案中心的
电话是用来救命
999 report center is for  people who are badly in need

520
00:37:19,637 --> 00:37:20,968
不是用来玩的
It's not for prank call

521
00:37:21,105 --> 00:37:22,766
我不是开玩笑
I'm not kidding

522
00:37:22,907 --> 00:37:26,673
我是见义勇为，我是良好市民呀
I'm just trying to be a good citizen

523
00:37:26,744 --> 00:37:28,644
我六岁就加入“少年警讯”啦
I've joined Junior Police since I was six

524
00:37:28,713 --> 00:37:31,614
我把每集都录下来
I recorded every episode of  “Junior Police” (TV program)

525
00:37:31,682 --> 00:37:33,616
你现在诬蔑我报假案？
Now you're trying to  defame me for false reporting?

526
00:37:33,918 --> 00:37:37,046
又不是我受伤，也不是我家人受伤
Neither me nor my family got hurt

527
00:37:37,121 --> 00:37:39,180
我肯抽时间来报警…
I still take time to report this…

528
00:37:48,299 --> 00:37:50,699
妹妹，借个电话
Miss, can I borrow your phone?

529
00:37:51,836 --> 00:37:53,064
那边不就有电话了？
Isn't there a phone?

530
00:37:54,538 --> 00:37:56,438
先生…借个电话我报警
Sir, can I borrow your phone  to call the police?

531
00:37:56,507 --> 00:37:58,702
我正在跟报案中心说话呢
I'm now talking to them right now

532
00:37:59,510 --> 00:38:02,570
我现在让伤者直接跟你说
I will let the victim  talk to you directly

533
00:38:04,548 --> 00:38:06,778
喂，是不是员警？
Hello? Is it the police?

534
00:38:30,608 --> 00:38:32,473
先生，谢谢
Thanks, sir

535
00:38:32,543 --> 00:38:33,601
谢谢你
Thanks

536
00:38:34,712 --> 00:38:35,701
救护车快到了
The ambulance will be here soon

537
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:36,940
不用客气…
You're welcome…

538
00:38:38,082 --> 00:38:39,208
再见
Bye

539
00:38:40,418 --> 00:38:41,544
你不陪我等员警呀？
Aren't you staying with me  till the police arrive?

540
00:38:41,619 --> 00:38:43,211
你是男人，不用陪了
You're a big man,  no need for companionship

541
00:38:43,287 --> 00:38:44,618
那你也要录口供呀
You have to give your testimony too

542
00:38:44,789 --> 00:38:46,086
这么麻烦？
So troublesome?

543
00:38:46,157 --> 00:38:48,648
用你的电话报警，一查就知道了
I used your phone, they can trace back

544
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:50,724
别走啊！     我不知道…
Don't go!       Don't ask me…

545
00:38:50,795 --> 00:38:52,456
我什么都不知道呀
I know nothing about this

546
00:39:17,688 --> 00:39:20,384
喂     麻烦你陆仔
Hello?       Is it Luk?

547
00:39:20,458 --> 00:39:22,551
你是谁？
Who is it?

00:48:31,274 --> 00:48:32,536
她说累了…
She said she's tired…

683
00:48:32,608 --> 00:48:34,098
要换衣服，还要换妆
and she's got to change and make-up

684
00:48:34,177 --> 00:48:35,235
欢迎…
Welcome…

685
00:48:35,311 --> 00:48:37,438
男家还是女家？
Bride's side or bridegroom's side?

686
00:48:37,513 --> 00:48:40,505
我是新郎的前度女友
算男家还是女家？
I'm the bridegroom's ex-girIfriend,  so what do you think?

687
00:48:43,486 --> 00:48:45,283
新郎哥！
The bridegroom!

688
00:48:53,096 --> 00:48:54,529
真要恭喜你呀
Congratulations

689
00:48:57,066 --> 00:48:59,796
麻烦你先拍我妈妈那边…
Please shoot my mother first…

690
00:48:59,869 --> 00:49:01,131
谢谢
Thanks

691
00:49:02,872 --> 00:49:05,864
你说不来，怎么会在这儿？
I thought you won't come,  why are you here now?

692
00:49:05,942 --> 00:49:07,432
是不是很惊喜？
So are you surprised?

693
00:49:10,947 --> 00:49:14,508
你忘了？你说过要娶我的
Did you forget that  you promised to marry me

694
00:49:17,720 --> 00:49:20,484
不如…先打几圈麻将吧
How about playing mahjong

695
00:49:21,090 --> 00:49:22,318
我知道我少了什么
I know what I'm short of

696
00:49:33,703 --> 00:49:36,536
小姐，请问穿几号尺码？
Miss, what's your size?

697
00:49:36,606 --> 00:49:37,573
36D
P0

698
00:49:38,474 --> 00:49:42,171
你是说D…还是C？
Did you say D or C?

699
00:49:42,245 --> 00:49:44,611
你快去拿G号给这位小姐
Get a G cup for this lady

700
00:49:44,680 --> 00:49:45,977
G？     对
G?       Right

701
00:49:46,048 --> 00:49:49,074
其实戴G号，加些配套就更好
But G-cup has to go with some accessories

702
00:49:49,152 --> 00:49:50,210
你看这边
Look at these

703
00:49:52,855 --> 00:49:55,790
海棉j仔糕，价钱便宜一点
Spongy bra pad, it's economical

704
00:49:55,858 --> 00:49:58,053
夏天来说，我觉得会比较热
but they're too thick  for the sweaty summer

705
00:49:58,127 --> 00:50:00,721
所以有些客人会多花点钱
Some customers would prefer these

706
00:50:00,796 --> 00:50:02,263
不怕贵的，买这个
regardless of the price

707
00:50:02,331 --> 00:50:04,492
矽胶     是什么呀？

矽袋，用来隆胸的
Silicon gel, same material  for breast implants

709
00:50:07,103 --> 00:50:08,263
你摸摸
Touch it

710
00:50:09,005 --> 00:50:10,404
真的很有手感
It feels so genuine

711
00:50:10,473 --> 00:50:12,373
是啊，穿汗衫、衬衫的话

716
00:50:21,317 --> 00:50:22,614

你有没有觉得，我今天有什么不同？

724
00:50:42,471 --> 00:50:44,371
妆很浓
You're heavy make-up

725
00:50:44,440 --> 00:50:45,998
再往下看
Look downward

726
00:50:50,980 --> 00:50:52,607

一场相识…两人打麻将吧

730
00:51:02,758 --> 00:51:05,056
两人怎么打麻将呀？

怕再输给我呀？

739
00:51:30,186 --> 00:51:32,780
对了，各位从事哪个行业？
By the way, what business are you guys in?

740
00:51:32,855 --> 00:51:34,948
跟打麻将有什么关系？

我好害怕
I'm so scared

753
00:52:10,693 --> 00:52:14,129
不用怕，这种肉毒杆菌针很多人打过
Don't be scared, many people  have tried “botox” before

754
00:52:14,196 --> 00:52:16,221
不是，我是怕外面的狗仔队
No, I'm scared of  those paparazzi waiting outside

755
00:52:16,299 --> 00:52:17,994
等会儿我怎么出去？
How could I leave here?

756
00:52:18,067 --> 00:52:20,501
张太太，你放心，我有办法
Mrs. Cheung, don't be afraid.  I have an idea

757

先躺下，打支针
Just lie down, get the shot

758
00:52:24,540 --> 00:52:25,598
真的认不出来？
Are you sure they can't recognize me?

759
00:52:25,675 --> 00:52:28,269
你戴上这假发就认不出来了，我帮你
As long as you put on this wig,  let me help you

760

我带你走后门

762
00:52:34,383 --> 00:52:37,079
你的工作挺偏的
Yourjob is kind of unique

763
00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:40,011
是不是看到很多人性弱点？

764

这是我的名片

不…新娘换衣服很久了

I haven't seen any of  my primary schooI's classmates

774
00:53:14,724 --> 00:53:17,852
小学同学？都已经变样啦
Primary schooI's classmates?  They might have changed so much

775
00:53:17,927 --> 00:53:19,258
不会那么容易认啊
How could you recognize them?

776
00:53:21,430 --> 00:53:23,364
自摸双辣！
Win on “self-draw”, it is “one suit”

777
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:26,794
这么快自摸？说不定是骗子出千
So soon? Are you cheating?

778
00:53:26,869 --> 00:53:27,836
你说什么？
What did you say?

779
00:53:27,903 --> 00:53:30,667
什么！就是你一向用的阴招
What? You used to play sly trick

780
00:53:30,740 --> 00:53:33,231
安吉莉娜宝贝就是这样被你撬走的
That's how you stole  Angelina Baby from me

781
00:53:33,309 --> 00:53:35,709

Tell me, are you thinking of her  when you kiss me?

782
00:53:36,946 --> 00:53:38,277
哪个她呀？

783
00:53:41,117 --> 00:53:42,345
你干嘛？
What's wrong?

784
00:53:46,155 --> 00:53:48,555
六宝说，你整天躲在厕所看她
Luk Po said you enjoy watching her  photo-collection in the washroom

785
00:53:50,893 --> 00:53:52,952
这本书不是我的
This book's not mine

786
00:53:53,028 --> 00:53:54,256
安吉莉娜宝贝！

787
00:53:58,501 --> 00:53:59,559
六宝！
Luk Po!

多嘴问一下

谁是安吉莉娜宝贝？
Who's Angelina Baby?

790
00:54:09,145 --> 00:54:11,306
就是撬走我新郎哥的那个！
The one that took away my bridegroom

791
00:54:11,714 --> 00:54:13,204
彼得
Peter

792
00:54:14,316 --> 00:54:15,977
你是不是娶我？
Will you marry me?

793
00:54:20,222 --> 00:54:21,450
有样东西给你
I have something for you

794
00:54:28,697 --> 00:54:30,665
你连喜帖都印好啦？

亲亲

796
00:54:38,307 --> 00:54:40,798
安吉莉娜与彼得？

797
00:54:40,876 --> 00:54:42,935
你跟那个婆娘结婚？
You're gonna marry that bitch?

798
00:54:43,012 --> 00:54:44,673
怎么会这样？
Why?

799
00:54:45,314 --> 00:54:47,908
没办法，她…有了
I've no choice, she's pregnant

800
00:54:50,386 --> 00:54:52,854
你不是说她打掉了吗？
Didn't you say she has  gone through an abortion?

801
00:54:52,922 --> 00:54:54,321
是，但是…
Yes, but…

802
00:54:54,390 --> 00:54:56,255
又有了
She's pregnant again

803
00:54:56,325 --> 00:54:59,488
怎么会这样？你个混蛋！
How could it be possible? You bastard!

804
00:55:02,631 --> 00:55:05,930
你们的关系真是错综复杂
You guys have such a  complicated and messy relationship

805
00:55:06,001 --> 00:55:08,435
不是虚线，就是实线
Just like entangling lines  in a relationship chart

806
00:55:13,242 --> 00:55:16,439
小姐，这是表面上假好心
Miss, that's pretentious

807
00:55:16,512 --> 00:55:18,639
实情是害你
In fact they're trying to harm you

808
00:55:18,714 --> 00:55:19,681
你说什么？
What did you say?

809
00:55:19,748 --> 00:55:21,841
打牌搭人家肩膀呀
Tapping on someone's shoulder  when playing mahjong is bad luck

810
00:55:21,917 --> 00:55:23,885
东西可以乱拍，话可不能乱讲
You should watch your mouth

811
00:55:27,122 --> 00:55:30,558
虽然你我素昧平生
AIthough it's the first time we meet

812
00:55:30,626 --> 00:55:33,459
但我能够体会你的伤感
I do understand how sorrowful you are

813
00:55:33,929 --> 00:55:37,660
因为小弟今早也被女朋友抛弃了
My girIfriend has dumped me this morning

814
00:55:40,369 --> 00:55:43,805
这里有包纸巾，希望能帮你
Here's tissue paper, hope it'll help

815
00:55:46,642 --> 00:55:50,601
带纸巾外出的男生真的很体贴
A guy that brings tissue paper along  must be tender-loving-care

816
00:55:50,679 --> 00:55:52,408
你女朋友不识货
It's your girIfriend's loss

817
00:55:53,949 --> 00:55:55,473
你女朋友错失良机
Your girIfriend missed a Mr. Right

818
00:56:02,258 --> 00:56:02,883
喂
Hello?

819
00:56:02,958 --> 00:56:04,721
你那边踩场踩成怎样？
How are you doing in the wedding banquet?

820
00:56:05,060 --> 00:56:07,255
我还没看见那婆娘
I haven't seen that bitch yet

821
00:56:07,329 --> 00:56:10,127
现在踩到麻将卓上了
I'm now playing mahjong

822
00:56:10,199 --> 00:56:11,461
说回你那笔…
Regarding you…

823
00:56:11,534 --> 00:56:14,662
我有个很细心的好男生介绍给你
I do have a tender-loving-care  guy for you

824
00:56:14,737 --> 00:56:15,795
你等等
Wait

825
00:56:17,172 --> 00:56:18,332
不会吧…
No way…

826
00:56:20,142 --> 00:56:21,404
他不要，让给我
He passes, give it to me

827
00:56:22,411 --> 00:56:23,742
他害羞啊
He's too shy

828
00:56:23,812 --> 00:56:25,905
我回头传他的电话号码给你
I'll text you his phone number later

829
00:56:26,115 --> 00:56:27,480
他是个…
He is…

830
00:56:27,550 --> 00:56:31,042
带纸巾，够细心，大好青年
a tender-loving-care young man  who brings along tissue paper

831
00:56:31,120 --> 00:56:32,417
你耍我呀？
Don't try to fooI me!

832
00:56:32,488 --> 00:56:35,480
不跟你说了，我要打麻将减压
I'm hanging up, I need to play mahjong  to relieve my stress

833
00:56:35,558 --> 00:56:36,855
再见…
Bye…

834
00:56:46,630 --> 00:56:50,000
(A tender-loving-care young man who brings)  (along tissue paper. Phone number: 64897123.)

835
00:57:01,317 --> 00:57:05,083
六对半！一双一对，真扎眼
6 pairs and a half! Suck! All in pairs

836
00:57:05,154 --> 00:57:06,678
那就做对对糊吧？
Go for “all pong hand” then?

837
00:57:06,755 --> 00:57:09,724
你是挪移还是挖苦？
我偏不做对对糊！
Are you teasing me?  I won't go for“ all pong hand” though

838
00:57:10,459 --> 00:57:12,552
有种你就拆散它们吧
Dare you break them up

839
00:57:15,264 --> 00:57:16,925
拆散你！     碰！
Break you up!       Pong!

840
00:57:28,177 --> 00:57:30,737
拆散你！     碰！南！
Break you up!       Pong! “South”!

841
00:57:30,813 --> 00:57:32,542
你不是吧？
Are you kidding?

842
00:57:32,615 --> 00:57:35,778
在我人生最悲伤的时候
你叫大四喜？
It's the saddest time in my life；  you are ready to claim for “big 4 winds”?

843
00:57:35,851 --> 00:57:38,479
你是不是串通他们一起来耍我？
Are you guys trying to set me up?

844
00:57:38,554 --> 00:57:41,022
没这种事…
Of course not…

845
00:57:41,090 --> 00:57:43,217
塘边鹤，他是不是做大四喜？
Bystander, is he claiming  for “big 4 winds”?

846
00:57:43,292 --> 00:57:44,816
是不是？
Isn't it?

847
00:57:44,893 --> 00:57:47,623
你们问我已经很不对了
It's not right for you to ask me

848
00:57:47,696 --> 00:57:50,028
我再回答，不就更错？
And it'll be wrong for me to answer you

849
00:57:52,601 --> 00:57:54,466
这位兄弟，等会儿…
Buddy, wait…

850
00:57:54,536 --> 00:57:56,766
如果有人打番子出来，你喊糊的话
If someone discards an honour tile  and you're claiming for a win

851
00:57:56,839 --> 00:57:58,636
记得要喊大声点，清楚点
then you have to  declare it loud and clear

852
00:57:58,707 --> 00:58:01,835
看这儿，记住要笑
And, look at the camera,  remember to smile

853
00:58:01,910 --> 00:58:03,104
笑呀
Smile

854
00:58:22,264 --> 00:58:25,028
别想了，拆了就拆吧
Don't think about that,  just break them up

855
00:58:25,100 --> 00:58:27,398
拆散你！
你怎么这么多事？
Break you up!       Are you that nosy?

856
00:58:38,714 --> 00:58:39,772
拆啦
Break them up

857
00:58:39,848 --> 00:58:42,282
是你打还是她打？
请问谁打呢？
Who's playing now?  May I know who is playing now?

858
00:58:42,351 --> 00:58:44,182
我打！拆散你！
I'm playing! Break you up!

859
00:58:56,598 --> 00:58:57,929
再拆吧
Again

860
00:58:59,134 --> 00:59:00,533
拆散你！
Break them up!

861
00:59:00,602 --> 00:59:02,900
现在是你打还是她打呀？…
Who's playing now? You or she?…

862
00:59:15,851 --> 00:59:16,977
六筒
“6 stones”

863
00:59:25,394 --> 00:59:26,827
我不拆啦！
I'm not gonna break these two up

864
00:59:28,263 --> 00:59:30,254
七筒     吃！
“7 stones”!       “Hu”! (Winning)

865
00:59:32,401 --> 00:59:34,528
吃回七筒这么狡猾？
You're so cunning to have  a “ready hand” for a “7 stones”

866
00:59:34,603 --> 00:59:36,764
我出冲了？
Huh? I have to pay double?

867
00:59:36,839 --> 00:59:39,501
还好，鸡糊来的
It's lucky that it's  just a “chicken hand”

868
00:59:39,641 --> 00:59:43,509
你错啦，这里一台花，加一张正花
You're wrong, here's a  “all flowers” and a “seat season”

869
00:59:43,579 --> 00:59:44,876
三番
Three “fans”. (points)

870
00:59:47,416 --> 00:59:48,883
又输啦！
Lost again

871
00:59:57,192 --> 01:00:00,787
我的纸巾给你用光了
You used up my tissues

872
01:00:00,863 --> 01:00:03,696
或者，要不要离开这个伤心地？
Should you leave such a grieving place?

873
01:00:04,633 --> 01:00:06,567
是啊，你还留在这儿干嘛？
Yeah, why should you stay here?

874
01:00:06,735 --> 01:00:09,727
何必让人在你的伤口上洒盐呢
Shouldn't let people  sow salt on your wound

875
01:00:10,139 --> 01:00:11,697
我来这里做事的
I'm here to “work”

876
01:00:11,774 --> 01:00:12,934
做什么？
What?

877
01:00:13,776 --> 01:00:16,939
你关掉摄影机，我告诉你们
You switched that off and I'll tell you

878
01:00:17,012 --> 01:00:18,036
好，我不拍
Okay, already off

879
01:00:22,017 --> 01:00:23,541
知不知道这瓶是什么？
Do you know what this is?

880
01:00:23,619 --> 01:00:25,086
什么来的？
What?

881
01:00:25,154 --> 01:00:26,985
肉毒杆菌
Botulinus

882
01:00:27,055 --> 01:00:28,317
名字这么毒？
What an awful name!

883
01:00:28,390 --> 01:00:29,789
也就是Botox
That's Botox

884
01:00:29,858 --> 01:00:33,851
是整容诊所帮人瘦面去皱纹用的
It's used in plastic surgery clinic  for wrinkle elimination

885
01:00:33,929 --> 01:00:35,590
就是你打的那种？
You have tried that?

886
01:00:35,664 --> 01:00:36,892
差不多
Kind of

887
01:00:36,965 --> 01:00:39,763
不过，这瓶是经过提炼
But this one's been refined

888
01:00:39,835 --> 01:00:42,099
高纯度的肉毒杆菌
It's highly concentrated

889
01:00:42,171 --> 01:00:45,470
要是吃进肚子里
绝对可以杀人于无形
It could kill if taken orally

890
01:00:45,541 --> 01:00:49,568
不过我现在烦恼着
应该把它放在第几道菜
I'm wondering in which dish  I should put this

891
01:00:49,645 --> 01:00:51,670
才不会伤及小朋友
so that no children will be hurt

892
01:00:52,915 --> 01:00:56,783
以我的经验
小朋友吃完鱼翅就到处跑
According to my experience, children run  around after having the shark's fins

893
01:01:12,134 --> 01:01:13,601
你不可以这样做！
You can't do that!

894
01:01:13,669 --> 01:01:14,863
为什么？
Why?

895
01:01:17,306 --> 01:01:18,466
让我来
Let me do it

896
01:01:19,975 --> 01:01:21,875
知不知道这瓶是什么？
Do you know what this is?

897
01:01:21,944 --> 01:01:23,844
可乐呗     当然不是
Coke.       Of course not

898
01:01:23,912 --> 01:01:26,039
这瓶可乐昨晚已经被我喝光了
I drank the coke last night

899
01:01:26,181 --> 01:01:27,978
这经典的可乐瓶子里面
Now, it's highly  concentrated flammable liquid

900
01:01:28,050 --> 01:01:30,245
装的是高度易燃液体
inside this classic coke bottle

901
01:01:30,319 --> 01:01:32,082
这么厉害？
So cooI

902
01:01:32,154 --> 01:01:33,086
有没有学名？
Is there any technical name for that?

903
01:01:33,155 --> 01:01:35,623
你懂个屁！化学你都不及格
You know shit about that!  You failed your chemistry though

904
01:01:35,691 --> 01:01:37,488
你只会勾人家的女人！
You just know luring other's girIfriend

905
01:01:37,559 --> 01:01:39,151
安吉莉娜宝贝呀！
Angelina Baby!

906
01:01:41,263 --> 01:01:45,029
待会你们找个安全地方躲一躲
When the time comes, you guys better  find a safe place to hide

907
01:01:45,100 --> 01:01:47,625
你呀，要把我拍得好看点
You must take good shot of me

908
01:01:48,637 --> 01:01:49,865
我会…
I will…

909
01:01:51,907 --> 01:01:54,535
谢谢各位来宾赏面出席
Thanks for coming to our banquet

910
01:01:54,610 --> 01:01:55,838
大家干杯！
Cheers!

911
01:01:56,812 --> 01:02:00,407
各位来宾，我的宝贝！
Ladies and gentlemen,  I loved Angelina Baby!

912
01:02:09,758 --> 01:02:11,783
我不是泼你冷水
I'm not trying to discourage you

913
01:02:11,860 --> 01:02:13,953
但我觉得你很蠢
But I think you're so stupid

914
01:02:14,029 --> 01:02:16,998
我把你拍得多帅也没用，你都看不到
You wouldn't be able to see it  even I've taken good shot of you

915
01:02:18,433 --> 01:02:21,061
他一直是这样，思想只有幼稚园程度
He's always like this,  he's just up to kindergarten level

916
01:02:22,871 --> 01:02:24,361
看看我吧
Watch me

917
01:02:26,074 --> 01:02:28,474
希望大家今晚多喝一杯！
Hope you will enjoy the dinner. Cheers!

918
01:02:31,780 --> 01:02:33,611
好，我们祝贺这对新人！
Okay, let's greet on the newlyweds

919
01:02:33,682 --> 01:02:35,172
恭喜…
Congratulations…

920
01:02:35,250 --> 01:02:37,946
先生女士们，小朋友和大人
Ladies and Gentlemen…

921
01:02:38,020 --> 01:02:40,614
我们一起欣赏这对新人的浪漫史
Let's share the romantic  story of the couple

922
01:02:40,689 --> 01:02:41,883
放片！
Here it goes!

923
01:03:00,442 --> 01:03:02,034
怎么不是新郎？
It's not the groom?

924
01:03:05,480 --> 01:03:07,311
宝贝…
Angelina Baby…

925
01:03:09,384 --> 01:03:09,873
正点
Great!

926
01:03:09,952 --> 01:03:13,217
你们俩待会什么都别做
You two, don't do anything

927
01:03:13,722 --> 01:03:17,180
我玛丽艾塔要做的事，谁也阻挡不了
No one can stop what  Marietta is going to do

928
01:03:17,259 --> 01:03:20,160
你这样活活杀光了观众
If you kill all my audience

929
01:03:20,228 --> 01:03:22,253
没有人看我殉情了
no one can see me  being the martyr of loved

930
01:03:22,564 --> 01:03:25,055
你那个光害人，你那个光害自己
Your way will only harm the others  while yours will only harm yourself

931
01:03:25,133 --> 01:03:26,566
我这个又害人又害己
Mine will do both

932
01:03:26,635 --> 01:03:29,001
当然首选我这个杀伤力最强的
My way is most harmful. Use mine

933
01:03:29,137 --> 01:03:32,004
大哥，你快说句公道话
Bro, you should say something

934
01:03:34,343 --> 01:03:37,744
你，搞生化战，涂炭生灵
You are deploying biochemical lethal stuff,  plunging people into abyss of misery

935
01:03:37,813 --> 01:03:40,179
你傻兮兮，自找苦吃
You are such a fooI,  kicking yourself against the pricks

936
01:03:40,248 --> 01:03:41,180
最坏是你
You are so evil

937
01:03:41,249 --> 01:03:44,150
非法强迫他人分享你的淫亵影片
You force others to  share your obscene clip

938
01:03:44,219 --> 01:03:46,619
缺德老套，天怒人怨！
Wicked, tacky and indignant

939
01:03:46,688 --> 01:03:49,156
摄影师哥哥，请问…
Bro, I'd like to ask…

940
01:03:49,224 --> 01:03:52,990
你口袋里那支笔怎么会有灯亮着？
Why is your pen having a light?

941
01:03:53,061 --> 01:03:55,359
你偷拍？     你偷拍我们？
You…  You are taking sneaky shot on us?

942
01:03:55,430 --> 01:03:56,920
偷拍？     放手…
Taking sneaky shot?       Let me go…

943
01:03:56,999 --> 01:03:58,967
我有你们三个的犯罪证据
I got the proof of you guys' crime

944
01:03:59,034 --> 01:04:00,934
你们三个的下场都会一样
You guys wilI have the same ending

945
01:04:01,003 --> 01:04:02,561
仆…
Damn…

946
01:04:02,637 --> 01:04:04,434
你有种再仆一次？
Dare you say that again?

947
01:04:04,506 --> 01:04:05,666
我不仆啦
I'm not

948
01:04:05,741 --> 01:04:06,799
我…
I fxxk you all fxxking bastards

949
01:04:06,875 --> 01:04:09,002
你…      我让你仆！
You…       Damn you!

950
01:04:11,513 --> 01:04:12,912
太失礼了！
Too shameful!

951
01:04:31,500 --> 01:04:33,263
什么事？
What's happening?

952
01:04:33,335 --> 01:04:35,599
上面是拍电影还是着火了？
Is it on show or on fire up there?

953
01:04:35,771 --> 01:04:37,432
是不是砍人呀？
Is someone got chopped up?

954
01:04:37,506 --> 01:04:41,101
麻烦让让…      陆仔…
Give way…       Luk…

955

走到哪都遇上坏事
I don't know why I'm so pissed today,  all the bad things are coming to me

965
01:05:15,243 --> 01:05:17,143
我可能开始倒楣了
I must be out of luck

966
01:05:18,246 --> 01:05:20,407
其实你走得真是时候
You left at good timing

967

我不想连累你

973
01:05:42,838 --> 01:05:45,068
是卡拉OK还是夜总会呀？
It's karaoke or club?

老板，我最近很失落

01:06:15,036 --> 01:06:18,733
妈妈病了，妹妹又要交学费
My mom is sick,  I've to pay for my sis' tuition fee

Yesterday, a boss asked me  to be his mistress for 3 months

981
01:06:22,611 --> 01:06:25,011
但是，我最舍不得是你
But I miss you so much

982
01:06:25,080 --> 01:06:27,514
所以还在考虑
So I'm still thinking about that…

983
01:06:27,582 --> 01:06:28,844
等会儿你就跟你的客人说
Then you'd tell your other clients  that you've been so down lately

984
01:06:28,917 --> 01:06:32,114
你很失落，妈妈病了
妹妹没钱交学费
your mom is sick and you've to  pay for your sis' tuition fee

Yesterday, a boss asked you  to be his mistress for 3 months

但你最舍不得他
But you miss him so much

987
01:06:35,490 --> 01:06:37,390
所以还在考虑，明白吗？
And you're still thinking  about that, okay?

988
01:06:55,443 --> 01:06:56,774
好不好听？
How's that?

989
01:06:58,180 --> 01:07:00,444
叫大声一点嘛，拍手
Louder! Clap hands!

990
01:07:01,516 --> 01:07:05,543
大声一点…老板唱得好！
Louder! Boss, you sing so well

991
01:07:06,855 --> 01:07:08,186
老板，是这边呀
Boss is over there

992
01:07:08,256 --> 01:07:09,587
怎样，有没有听我唱歌？
What's up? Did you listen to my singing?

993
01:07:09,658 --> 01:07:12,456
过儿哥，你唱得很好听
Don Guo, you sang so well

994
01:07:19,134 --> 01:07:20,362
当然好听     好听啊

995
01:07:20,435 --> 01:07:21,959
闪开…
Piss off…

996
01:07:22,037 --> 01:07:25,404
老板…

997
01:07:25,473 --> 01:07:28,772
怎样？
他就是那个画画的
What's it?       He's the cartoonist

998
01:07:28,843 --> 01:07:30,970
老板，你好！
Hi, boss

999
01:07:31,046 --> 01:07:33,310
你就是画画的？
You are the cartoonist?

1000
01:07:33,381 --> 01:07:35,315
样子长得挺卡通
Your look is funny though

1001
01:07:36,351 --> 01:07:37,648
今晚想怎样醉？
How would you like to get drunk tonight?

1002
01:07:37,719 --> 01:07:39,482
白兰地、红酒、女人、大麻
Brandy, red wine, women, cannabis…

1003
01:07:39,554 --> 01:07:41,146
什么都有，任君选择
We've everything here

1004
01:07:42,257 --> 01:07:44,487
老板问你想怎样醉呀
Boss is asking how  you would like to get drunk

1005
01:07:47,195 --> 01:07:49,959
老板…这样…
Boss… well…

1006
01:07:50,031 --> 01:07:52,898
听完故事才醉，行不行？
May I tell the story before I get drunk?

1007
01:07:54,569 --> 01:07:56,400
行，陈仔
Okay, Punk

1008
01:07:56,471 --> 01:07:59,702
学着吧，这就叫专业
you should learn this,  that's what we call professional

1009

倒杯酒给他
Give him a drink

1010
01:08:01,643 --> 01:08:03,975
还不谢谢老板
Shouldn't you thank boss?

1011
01:08:07,249 --> 01:08:09,945
喝吧！     谢谢…
Drink up.       Thanks…

1012
01:08:22,998 --> 01:08:25,466
老板，不介意的话，我就开始了
Boss, I'd like to start now

1013
01:08:25,533 --> 01:08:26,397
说吧…
Go ahead…

1014
01:08:26,468 --> 01:08:31,428
这故事是一个本来不应该死人
In this story,  there shouldn't be anyone die…

1015
01:08:31,506 --> 01:08:34,805
但最后死了很多人的故事
but so many people died at the end

1016
01:08:35,610 --> 01:08:39,046
这故事，一个开头亮闪闪
It's a story with  a bright and shiny beginning

1017
01:08:39,114 --> 01:08:42,140
后来就黑压压的
and with a dark and eerie ending

1018
01:08:43,385 --> 01:08:45,945
这故事讲述四种人
This story tells 4 kinds of people

1019
01:08:46,988 --> 01:08:50,185
第一种，以为自己很幸福
First kind, those who  think they are being well

1020
01:08:50,258 --> 01:08:52,226
其实是糊里糊涂
but in fact they are just too befuddled

1021
01:08:55,997 --> 01:09:00,764
第二种，幸福，因为他糊里糊涂
Second kind, they are being well  because they are befuddled

1022
01:09:06,574 --> 01:09:07,768
第三种…
Third kind…

1023
01:09:08,943 --> 01:09:12,743
身在福中…不知福
they fail to appreciate that  they have been being well

1024
01:09:16,251 --> 01:09:21,917
第四种，他不知道自己
是幸福还是不幸福
Lastly, they don't know whether  they are being well or not

1025
01:09:21,990 --> 01:09:23,287
因为他从没去想
because they've never thought of that

1026
01:09:30,165 --> 01:09:31,427
说完了
The End

1027
01:09:35,270 --> 01:09:36,498
好笑吧？
Funny?

1028
01:09:37,706 --> 01:09:39,333
好不好笑？
Is it funny?

1029
01:09:39,407 --> 01:09:40,738
好笑吧？
Funny?

1030
01:09:40,809 --> 01:09:41,969
行不行？
Is that good?

1031
01:09:42,043 --> 01:09:43,840
行，很好呢
Good, it's very good

1032
01:09:45,113 --> 01:09:46,978
好！明天上班！
Okay, get on to work tomorrow

1033
01:09:47,048 --> 01:09:49,380
把你的故事写成漫画
Make your story into comics

1034
01:09:49,451 --> 01:09:51,885
再拍卡通片都可以，是吧？
Or even cartoon movie will do, right?

1035
01:09:51,953 --> 01:09:54,922
还不谢谢老板
Shouldn't you say thanks to your boss?

1036
01:09:55,023 --> 01:09:56,581
喝吧     喝！
Drink it.        Drink up!

1037
01:09:56,658 --> 01:09:58,558

1045

但是我现在兴奋极了…

可以出书啦！

其实我不是很开心
In fact I'm so upset

1049

因为我不可以没有你

1050
01:11:23,645 --> 01:11:26,307
对不起
Sorry, man

你是想吵架？

1064
01:13:05,847 --> 01:13:09,248

If not? Why did you  kick me out of our home?

1067

我有话要跟你说

1084

能不能找个安静的地方？

我只是想找个安静的地方谈谈

本来是有话想说，但是…
I do have something to say, but…

1089
01:15:36,197 --> 01:15:38,028
还没想到重点
I can't think of the main point

1090
01:15:39,167 --> 01:15:40,725
那你怎么写书呀？
How could you be a writer?

1091
01:15:42,737 --> 01:15:44,671
因为我分了心
I could if I'm not distracted

1092
01:15:53,614 --> 01:15:55,047
现在我想到啦
Now I got it

1093
01:15:56,551 --> 01:15:58,382
你吃了什么药，这么可爱？
What drug did you take? You're so cute?

1094
01:16:01,055 --> 01:16:04,855
方美芳，别在这里做
Fong, don't do it here

1095
01:16:05,927 --> 01:16:07,451
那你想在哪里做？
Where do you want then?

1096
01:16:08,229 --> 01:16:10,254
不…你误会了…
No… don't get me wrong…

1097
01:16:10,331 --> 01:16:13,858
我意思是叫你别在这儿上班
I mean, don't work here anymore

1098
01:16:14,569 --> 01:16:16,002
那你有没有钱？
Do you have money then?

1099
01:16:17,438 --> 01:16:18,632
没有
No

1100
01:16:18,706 --> 01:16:20,503
你没钱，我不会跟你的
You've no money, I wouldn't be your girI

1101
01:16:22,443 --> 01:16:24,172
不如我说个故事给你听
Then let me tell you a story

1102
01:16:24,579 --> 01:16:25,841
什么故事？
What story?

1103
01:16:27,381 --> 01:16:31,283
从前，有个卖火柴的女孩
Once upon a time,  there's a little match girI

1104
01:16:31,352 --> 01:16:34,150
不是…是一个公主
No… should be a princess

1105
01:16:34,222 --> 01:16:37,385
但是她不知道自己是公主
But she doesn't know her true identity

1106
01:16:37,458 --> 01:16:41,155
这个公主上学读书
This princess goes to a bad schooI

1107
01:16:41,229 --> 01:16:44,357
同学全都是来自五湖四海
Her classmates are from alI walks of life

1108
01:16:44,432 --> 01:16:46,764
三山五岳，没有一个好人
None of them are good stuff

1109
01:16:46,834 --> 01:16:49,325
那些老师…也懒得理
The teachers there just won't give a damn

1110
01:16:50,204 --> 01:16:52,934
最有勇气的，就是提醒你交学费
What they care most is not the students,  but the tuition fee

1111
01:16:54,208 --> 01:16:56,904
公主很彷徨
The princess is so lost and miserable

1112
01:16:56,978 --> 01:16:59,344
很想找人帮助，但没有人帮助她
Hoping someone may help her,  but her hope is in vain

1113
01:16:59,413 --> 01:17:01,540
直到有一天
Until one day

1114
01:17:01,616 --> 01:17:03,811
她遇到一个王子
she's met a prince

1115
01:17:03,885 --> 01:17:08,845
这王子很好，什么都肯给她
The prince is so nice  and willing to give her everything

1116
01:17:08,923 --> 01:17:13,986
所以，公主也什么都肯给王子
So the princess is willing to  give whatever the prince wants

1117
01:17:15,830 --> 01:17:18,196
但是，有一天…
But, one day…

1118
01:17:19,133 --> 01:17:22,227
王子变成了青蛙
the prince turns into a frog

1119
01:17:22,303 --> 01:17:26,637
而公主就变成…援助交际
While the princess  turns to compensated-dating

1120
01:17:29,577 --> 01:17:32,705
不好意思，我不是援助交际
Excuse me, I'm not  into compensated-dating

1121
01:17:32,780 --> 01:17:34,441
我是性工作者
I'm a sex-worker

1122
01:17:37,652 --> 01:17:42,589
那我希望性工作者最后一夜上班
Then I do wish that…the sex worker

1123
01:17:42,657 --> 01:17:44,215
明天做回公主
will turn back into a princess tomorrow

1124
01:17:51,232 --> 01:17:52,859
凭什么要我听你的？
What makes you think I'll listen to you?

1125
01:17:55,336 --> 01:17:56,963
我的心
My heart

1126
01:18:03,411 --> 01:18:06,903
我想，这个愿望也不算过分
I guess, my wish is not that demanding

1127
01:18:08,182 --> 01:18:09,740
那你有没有过分的愿望？
Do you have demanding wishes?

1128
01:18:11,652 --> 01:18:12,812
有
Yes

1129
01:18:23,431 --> 01:18:26,525
抽完这包烟，戒掉它吧
I'd like you to quit smoking  after this pack

1130
01:18:54,996 --> 01:18:56,554
你是不是耍花样？
Are you trying to mess with me?

1131
01:18:58,232 --> 01:18:59,722
想干嘛？
What do you want?

1132
01:18:59,800 --> 01:19:01,665
想劈你呀！
I will chop you up!

1133
01:19:01,736 --> 01:19:04,000
还有人     你什么态度啊?
It's occupied.  What kind of attitude is this?

1134
01:19:04,205 --> 01:19:07,106
还有人…
Someone's still inside…

1135
01:20:01,062 --> 01:20:02,222
总编！
Mr. Chan

1136
01:20:03,464 --> 01:20:06,194
你慢慢…我回去开工啦
Take your time… I'm going back to work

1137
01:20:10,071 --> 01:20:12,005
那你想怎样？
What do you want then?

1138
01:20:12,073 --> 01:20:13,904
什么想怎样？
What do you mean?

1139
01:20:13,975 --> 01:20:16,170
这么多年来，你都没说让我
It's been so many years,  you've never given in to me once

1140
01:20:16,243 --> 01:20:18,006
我不让你，你还能站在这？
If I don't give in,  would you be standing here alive?

1141
01:20:18,079 --> 01:20:19,671
话不要反过来说，反骨仔
You, traitor,  shouldn't say the other way round

1142
01:20:19,747 --> 01:20:21,180
今天我就跟你算清这笔帐！
I'm gonna settle this with you

1143
01:20:21,248 --> 01:20:22,545
还不知道谁欠谁呢
Don't know who owes who

1144
01:20:22,616 --> 01:20:24,243
进房里算！     走啊！
Let's talk about that inside.  Let's go

1145
01:20:59,320 --> 01:21:00,719
弟兄们
Buddy!

1146
01:21:02,390 --> 01:21:06,520
今天我过儿哥有事要公告天下

1147
01:21:10,131 --> 01:21:16,695
多年来，我爱龙女姐爱得好痛苦
I've been loving Donna Dragon  for so many years

1148
01:21:18,039 --> 01:21:22,669
今天龙女姐终于答应我，再嫁给我
Today, Donna Dragon finally  promised to re-marry me

1149
01:21:22,743 --> 01:21:25,735
明天我和她举行婚礼！
We wilI have the  wedding ceremony tomorrow

1150
01:21:25,813 --> 01:21:28,145
干嘛要等到明天？今晚吧
Why tomorrow? Tonight's still young

1151
01:21:28,816 --> 01:21:30,078
好！
Okay!

1152
01:21:32,686 --> 01:21:35,849
从今晚开始，你老大就是我老大
Starting from tonight,  your boss is my boss

1153
01:21:35,923 --> 01:21:37,390
我老大就是你老大
My boss is your boss

1154
01:21:37,458 --> 01:21:39,585
大家就是兄弟姐妹啦
We are brothers and sisters then

1155
01:21:39,660 --> 01:21:42,458
我们两位老大水乳交融
Our bosses are having  a good time together

1156
01:21:42,530 --> 01:21:45,829
我们做小的，当然要欢乐今宵！
We small potatoes should  also enjoy ourselves

1157
01:21:49,670 --> 01:21:55,040
一时失志不免怨叹
It'd be frustrated

1158
01:21:55,109 --> 01:22:00,672
一时落魄不免胆寒
during the bad times

1159
01:22:00,748 --> 01:22:04,479
那通失去希望
Losing all the hope

1160
01:22:04,552 --> 01:22:07,214
每日醉茫茫
and fooling around

1161
01:22:07,288 --> 01:22:12,191
无魂有体亲像稻草人
Just like a dead man walking

1162
01:22:12,259 --> 01:22:17,959
人生可比是海上的波浪
Life is like the waves in the sea

1163
01:22:18,032 --> 01:22:22,560
有时起有时落
There would be ups and downs

1164
01:22:24,271 --> 01:22:26,865
好运，歹运
Good luck or bad luck

1165
01:22:27,274 --> 01:22:30,971
总嘛要照起工来行
You stilI have to live everyday anyway

1166
01:22:31,245 --> 01:22:34,646
三分天注定，七分靠打拼
30% depends on fate,  70% depends on effort

1167
01:22:34,715 --> 01:22:38,116
爱拼才会赢

这故事…可不可以有人死呀？
Could someone die in your story?

1173
01:25:05,065 --> 01:25:07,932
所以说，人生多么无常
That's why we say, life is impermanent

1174
01:25:16,443 --> 01:25:17,671
是不是赶着去死！
Are you rushing to hell?

1175
01:25:22,416 --> 01:25:23,576
喂
Hello?

但是我想这个世界美好一点
But I'd like a better world

1180
01:25:53,514 --> 01:25:55,482
那你自己美个够吧
You just go ahead then

1181

我把它留下来
你交给能拿主意的人看

没有了，就这些

留给别人吧

Where's the groom?       He's downstairs

1198

Isn't here Chan & Lee's Wedding?

It's such a coincidence, all three floors  are booked by “Chan & Lee's wedding”

别说我不给你机会
Don't say that I won't give you a chance

1206

再问你一次，你的故事肯不肯死人？
Will someone die in your story?
