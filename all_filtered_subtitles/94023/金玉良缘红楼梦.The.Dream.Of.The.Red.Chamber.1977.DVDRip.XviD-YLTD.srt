00:00:14,714 --> 00:00:17,239
"Rung Shi Hall,
by the order of His Majesty"

3
00:00:27,127 --> 00:00:38,595
Inside the Ning Kuo Mansion
of Jinling City

4
00:00:38,705 --> 00:00:51,015
...is the much-envied powerful Jia family

5
00:00:51,117 --> 00:01:02,995
Ancestors so patriotic;
while its descendants are rich

6
00:01:03,096 --> 00:01:09,592
There're 12 young maids in two ranks

7
00:01:09,702 --> 00:01:15,334
And many other maidens in the Da Guan Yuan

8
00:01:15,442 --> 00:01:23,247
that happened in the lives of
the female denizens

9
00:01:26,252 --> 00:01:28,777
Let me go, let me go

10
00:01:28,888 --> 00:01:30,219
Listen

11
00:01:31,157 --> 00:01:33,955
Hadn't I, Jiu Da,
carried your great grandfather...

12
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:37,029
from the heap of corpses long time ago

13
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:40,657
...you would not even exist

14
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:41,495
Yes...

15
00:01:41,601 --> 00:01:45,401
Even old great granny has to
give me some face

16
00:01:45,505 --> 00:01:46,802
Who do you think you are?

17
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:49,700
Lai Er? The Head housekeeper?

18
00:01:49,809 --> 00:01:51,936
What the hell do you think you are doing?

19
00:01:52,045 --> 00:01:55,310
You sent me for a no-good job
at the Ning residence

20
00:01:55,415 --> 00:01:57,906
why'd the affairs of the Rung mansion
concern me?

21
00:01:58,017 --> 00:02:01,851
And you send me out of the city
to get Miss Lin

22
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:05,482
I tell you, even if her mother
Jia Man were alive

23
00:02:05,592 --> 00:02:07,082
...she'd have to be nice to me

24
00:02:07,193 --> 00:02:09,161
Right...

25
00:02:09,262 --> 00:02:12,060
That Miss Lin, she could have stayed at...

26
00:02:12,165 --> 00:02:17,159
Soo Chow, yet she wants to get
mixed up with this lot

27
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:19,704
This mansion is full of bad elements

28
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:22,969
each one of them

29
00:02:23,076 --> 00:02:27,775
up to their own bad ways

30
00:02:27,881 --> 00:02:29,849
Out of my way, I'm coming over

31
00:02:29,949 --> 00:02:33,407
I have to go to old Master
at the ancestral temple

32
00:02:34,354 --> 00:02:35,821
Old Master

33
00:02:35,922 --> 00:02:38,914
Don't let Miss Lin come here

34
00:02:39,025 --> 00:02:41,255
No glory remains

35
00:02:41,361 --> 00:02:44,592
for the Ning & Rung mansion

36
00:02:44,697 --> 00:02:48,963
except these pristine lions'
two pairs at the gates...

37
00:04:01,841 --> 00:04:03,035
Grandmother

38
00:04:03,142 --> 00:04:04,541
Dai Yu

39
00:04:22,829 --> 00:04:25,730
Madam Lian, Miss Lin has arrived

40
00:04:26,165 --> 00:04:27,257
She's here already?

41
00:04:27,367 --> 00:04:28,334
She is in Old granny's room

42
00:04:28,434 --> 00:04:29,423
I'll change my clothes and come

43
00:04:30,236 --> 00:04:32,101
Bring ten broomsticks, ten dusters

44
00:04:32,205 --> 00:04:33,069
Alright...

45
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,670
You still on medicine now?

46
00:04:37,577 --> 00:04:38,669
Yes, second aunty

47
00:04:39,245 --> 00:04:42,578
I have been taking medicine since I born

48
00:04:43,249 --> 00:04:45,911
Then you need to take care of your health

49
00:04:46,252 --> 00:04:49,415
I'm late...

50
00:04:52,492 --> 00:04:55,586
Old granny, I'm late

51
00:04:57,363 --> 00:05:00,093
Dai Yu, meet cousin Lian

52
00:05:02,068 --> 00:05:02,932
Cousin Lian

53
00:05:03,036 --> 00:05:04,196
You're too kind, arise

54
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:11,337
No wonder you've been thought
of night and day

55
00:05:11,444 --> 00:05:13,742
You're like a great beauty in a painting

56
00:05:14,914 --> 00:05:17,212
Dai Yu, stay here from now on

57
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:18,215
Make yourself at home

58
00:05:18,951 --> 00:05:21,146
This is in fact your home

59
00:05:21,721 --> 00:05:24,451
Anything you want to eat or need

60
00:05:24,557 --> 00:05:26,252
...just tell me

61
00:05:26,359 --> 00:05:28,156
I'll make sure you get it

62
00:05:29,295 --> 00:05:31,286
Look at how you speak

63
00:05:32,732 --> 00:05:35,997
She is the famous shrew in the house

64
00:05:36,102 --> 00:05:38,263
Quite well-known in Nanking as Hot Chilly

65
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:40,599
Thank you, cousin Lian

66
00:05:42,909 --> 00:05:44,001
Madam Chow

67
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:46,101
get Miss Lin's entourage settled in

68
00:05:46,212 --> 00:05:47,076
Yes

69
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,040
Come with me

70
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:58,021
Dai Yu's chaperone is too young

71
00:05:58,124 --> 00:06:00,456
Take my...

72
00:06:03,496 --> 00:06:07,557
Ji Juan, you will serve Miss Lin
from now on

73
00:06:09,635 --> 00:06:10,465
Yes

74
00:06:13,706 --> 00:06:14,968
Greet Miss Lin

75
00:06:15,575 --> 00:06:16,439
Never mind

76
00:06:19,278 --> 00:06:20,540
Master Bao is back

77
00:06:54,113 --> 00:06:55,375
Greetings

78
00:06:56,549 --> 00:06:57,447
Good boy

79
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:11,222
Greetings, madams

80
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:12,228
Good boy

81
00:07:12,632 --> 00:07:13,894
Bao Yu

82
00:07:14,801 --> 00:07:16,598
We have a guest

83
00:07:16,702 --> 00:07:17,828
Come and meet cousin Lin

84
00:07:18,404 --> 00:07:19,336
Bao Yu

85
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:21,472
Sister Lin?

86
00:07:25,244 --> 00:07:27,269
- Sister Lin
- Bao Yu

87
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:33,978
Sister Lin

88
00:07:34,787 --> 00:07:37,119
I thought you looked familiar

89
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:39,588
Nonsense! Where have you seen her before?

90
00:07:39,692 --> 00:07:42,320
She's just come today,
how could you have seen her?

91
00:07:42,829 --> 00:07:45,764
I might not have met her
but she looks familiar

92
00:07:46,866 --> 00:07:48,527
It seems my heart has known her

93
00:07:49,168 --> 00:07:52,137
Good, then you'll get along fine

94
00:07:52,738 --> 00:07:54,672
Cousin Lin, have you studied before?

95
00:07:57,243 --> 00:07:58,175
Your name?

96
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:00,537
Dai Yu

97
00:08:00,646 --> 00:08:01,874
Any alias?

98
00:08:03,049 --> 00:08:03,981
None

99
00:08:06,219 --> 00:08:07,311
No alias?

100
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:19,455
Do you have any jade?

101
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:23,095
Your piece ofjade is a very precious one

102
00:08:23,202 --> 00:08:24,692
Not everybody could have one

103
00:08:32,612 --> 00:08:34,011
Bao Yu

104
00:08:36,749 --> 00:08:39,047
They say it's rare and has a spirit in it

105
00:08:39,151 --> 00:08:40,015
Well, I don't really care!

106
00:08:40,119 --> 00:08:41,051
Bao Yu...

107
00:08:41,153 --> 00:08:42,051
Brother Bao

108
00:08:42,455 --> 00:08:43,422
This kid

109
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:46,355
Bao Yu, wear it

110
00:08:46,459 --> 00:08:48,723
Come, brother Bao

111
00:08:52,164 --> 00:08:53,893
Wicked child

112
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,458
You can do whatever you like to
let off steam

113
00:08:57,570 --> 00:08:59,538
But not on that piece ofjade!

114
00:09:00,139 --> 00:09:02,004
None of the sisters got thatjade
except me

115
00:09:02,108 --> 00:09:04,576
Now the fairy-like cousin is here
& not even she's got

116
00:09:04,677 --> 00:09:05,837
So you can tell it's not a good thing

117
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:09,976
Brother Bao, come, wear it quickly

118
00:09:10,082 --> 00:09:11,071
No

119
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:12,044
Wear it quickly

120
00:09:12,151 --> 00:09:13,243
Bao Yu

121
00:09:13,352 --> 00:09:15,684
Brother Bao, Bao Yu, wear it quickly

122
00:09:15,988 --> 00:09:17,250
Brother Bao

123
00:09:17,356 --> 00:09:19,017
Brother Bao, come, wear it quickly

124
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:19,784
Bao Yu

125
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:21,757
Brother Bao, come, wear it quickly

126
00:09:21,861 --> 00:09:24,421
Brother Bao, be careful your dad
might know

127
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:31,196
Brother Bao, wear it quickly

128
00:09:32,104 --> 00:09:33,503
Hasn't old granny been saying all along?

129
00:09:33,606 --> 00:09:36,973
This family's asset depends on this child

130
00:09:52,692 --> 00:09:53,750
What is this?

131
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,987
It's the 26th of April today

132
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:57,619
This afternoon begins the festival
of summer

133
00:09:57,730 --> 00:09:59,493
After the festival summer will come

134
00:09:59,865 --> 00:10:02,527
Flowers will fade

135
00:10:02,635 --> 00:10:03,897
We have to bid the flower god farewell

136
00:10:05,071 --> 00:10:06,197
What is this then?

137
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:11,135
The water is pure,
I throw these petals in it

138
00:10:11,243 --> 00:10:12,369
and don't make these dirty

139
00:10:13,245 --> 00:10:15,270
They'll be dirty eventually

140
00:10:16,482 --> 00:10:17,608
I have a flower grave over there

141
00:10:17,717 --> 00:10:19,150
Put the petals in the gauze

142
00:10:19,251 --> 00:10:20,548
then bury them

143
00:10:20,653 --> 00:10:22,450
Flower grave? That's great

144
00:10:22,555 --> 00:10:23,579
Brother Bao

145
00:10:24,357 --> 00:10:25,688
Brother Bao, cousin Lin

146
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:27,114
Aunty Xue and Sister Bao Chai

147
00:10:27,226 --> 00:10:28,659
...have all moved in here

148
00:10:28,761 --> 00:10:31,127
Madam wants you to meet them

149
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:32,697
Sister Bao is here too

150
00:10:32,798 --> 00:10:34,026
Yes, now you have

151
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:35,464
...another play mate

152
00:10:35,835 --> 00:10:36,927
Go, quickly

153
00:10:39,071 --> 00:10:41,062
Ping Er, tidy up Lai Heung Room

154
00:10:41,173 --> 00:10:42,868
and bring Aunty Xue and Miss Bao
to stay there

155
00:10:42,975 --> 00:10:44,203
Yes, madam

156
00:10:48,414 --> 00:10:50,575
Come and meet aunty Xue and sister Bao

157
00:10:52,385 --> 00:10:54,216
Aunty Xue, Sister Bao

158
00:10:55,421 --> 00:10:56,479
Never mind

159
00:11:18,277 --> 00:11:24,614
Lose Not and Forget Not; Live a Long Life

160
00:11:25,217 --> 00:11:27,651
Leave Not and Abandon Not;
Keep a youthful mind

161
00:11:28,721 --> 00:11:30,279
Look like a real pair made in heaven

162
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:34,982
Lose Not and Forget Not; Live a Long Life

163
00:11:35,094 --> 00:11:37,927
Leave Not and Abandon Not;
Keep a youthful mind

164
00:11:38,464 --> 00:11:40,728
Indeed, a real pair made in heaven

165
00:12:07,827 --> 00:12:10,921
What fragrance, sister Bao, what is it?

166
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:14,131
It must be the aromatic pellet

167
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:15,632
...I took this morning

168
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:17,965
Does it really smell so good?

169
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:20,304
Sister Bao, let me try one

170
00:12:20,906 --> 00:12:21,873
Stop messing

171
00:12:21,974 --> 00:12:23,669
How could you take medicine
for the fun of it?

172
00:12:24,777 --> 00:12:26,711
Didn't you ask me to play chess with you?

173
00:12:27,146 --> 00:12:29,239
Come, let me take a pupil

174
00:12:29,615 --> 00:12:31,446
You should be my pupil

175
00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:45,497
Look

176
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:47,225
I picked up two pebbles

177
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:48,698
There are writings on them

178
00:12:48,801 --> 00:12:49,324
Writings?

179
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:50,993
What writings?

180
00:12:52,037 --> 00:12:55,495
Lose Not and Forget Not; Live a Long Life

181
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:58,569
I knew she has nothing good to say

182
00:12:58,677 --> 00:13:01,373
Really? This one has writings too

183
00:13:03,415 --> 00:13:09,376
Leave Not and Abandon Not;
Keep a youthful mind

184
00:13:12,057 --> 00:13:14,548
We're really a pair

185
00:13:15,427 --> 00:13:16,655
You...

186
00:13:21,767 --> 00:13:22,825
See if you dare again?

187
00:13:22,935 --> 00:13:24,835
Please...

188
00:13:43,889 --> 00:13:45,584
Smells good

189
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:54,428
It must be the aromatic pellet

190
00:13:54,533 --> 00:13:57,161
I took this morning

191
00:13:58,537 --> 00:13:59,561
You...

192
00:14:04,777 --> 00:14:06,642
See where you can run?

193
00:14:08,414 --> 00:14:10,974
Master Pao

194
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:15,650
Old master wants to see you

195
00:14:16,055 --> 00:14:17,022
What?

196
00:14:17,323 --> 00:14:18,415
Old master wants to see you

197
00:15:42,141 --> 00:15:47,807
Proper relations & virtues are
one's basic obligations

198
00:15:47,913 --> 00:15:51,280
To be loyal to the emperor

199
00:15:51,383 --> 00:15:54,318
To be filial to your father

200
00:15:54,987 --> 00:16:01,085
That is why loyal servants
come from filial families

201
00:16:02,928 --> 00:16:04,088
Bao Yu

202
00:16:04,196 --> 00:16:05,094
Yes

203
00:16:05,497 --> 00:16:08,625
Don't mess around with girls anymore

204
00:16:08,734 --> 00:16:10,634
You have to study hard and...

205
00:16:10,736 --> 00:16:14,103
you'll understand what proper
relations & virtues are

206
00:16:14,206 --> 00:16:14,968
Yes

207
00:17:51,403 --> 00:17:52,802
Sister

208
00:17:52,905 --> 00:18:03,304
I am so prone to illness and melancholy

209
00:18:03,415 --> 00:18:18,888
Your beauty is such that kingdoms
will fall for it

210
00:18:19,231 --> 00:18:21,563
Nonsense, you tease me

211
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:26,166
Good sister, don't, stop hitting me

212
00:18:26,338 --> 00:18:27,862
You are full of nonsense

213
00:18:27,973 --> 00:18:29,668
You've written this lustful rhyme

214
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:31,675
and say such nonsense to mock me

215
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:34,302
I'll tell uncle and aunty

216
00:18:34,413 --> 00:18:37,780
Good sister

217
00:18:37,883 --> 00:18:39,145
Give me a chance

218
00:18:39,251 --> 00:18:41,344
If I mean to mock you

219
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:43,254
Let me fall into the river

220
00:18:43,355 --> 00:18:44,754
be eaten by the turtle and

221
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:46,714
become a bastard

222
00:18:46,825 --> 00:18:48,656
When you become an official's lady
one day

223
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:50,523
and die in old age

224
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:53,826
Let me carry your tombstone
for my whole life

225
00:18:57,069 --> 00:19:01,733
Mr. Zhang has the guts to climb over
the wall

226
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:04,832
...and ask Hong Liang to send her
a letter

227
00:19:04,943 --> 00:19:09,573
Miss Cui dares to see him at night

228
00:19:09,681 --> 00:19:16,177
Wai Ming dares to wander around
the army camp

229
00:19:16,288 --> 00:19:21,282
I thought you were as bold

230
00:19:21,393 --> 00:19:28,526
but in fact you're only for show

231
00:19:29,535 --> 00:19:32,095
You said it, you said those words

232
00:19:32,404 --> 00:19:34,065
Fine, I'll tell on you

233
00:19:35,741 --> 00:19:36,969
Bao Yu

234
00:19:37,075 --> 00:19:38,133
Get out of my way

235
00:19:38,243 --> 00:19:40,438
Get out of my way. I have to go

236
00:19:42,981 --> 00:19:46,883
Go on...

237
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:51,082
Sister...

238
00:20:36,335 --> 00:20:42,797
My humble greetings

239
00:20:58,490 --> 00:21:00,754
Good sister, give this to me, okay?

240
00:21:03,695 --> 00:21:05,390
What good is it?

241
00:21:05,497 --> 00:21:07,089
In any event someone's bound to
give it to you

242
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:10,834
Someone's better than me at writing

243
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:13,632
and has treasures like gold and jade

244
00:21:13,739 --> 00:21:15,798
Look... there you go again

245
00:21:16,541 --> 00:21:17,906
You're are a wise person

246
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:20,604
you should know the philosophy of

247
00:21:20,712 --> 00:21:21,770
bonding with family first
rather than outsiders

248
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:24,041
Why would I distance you because of her?

249
00:21:24,783 --> 00:21:26,512
Have I told you to alienate her?

250
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:27,880
What kind of person would I be?

251
00:21:27,986 --> 00:21:29,351
I am only following my heart

252
00:21:29,454 --> 00:21:31,081
So am I

253
00:21:31,189 --> 00:21:33,453
Then you only know your heart

254
00:21:33,558 --> 00:21:35,219
and not mine?

255
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,428
Master Bao

256
00:21:47,205 --> 00:21:48,103
Master Bao

257
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:50,942
What is it?

258
00:21:51,043 --> 00:21:53,603
Master Fung has brought a box of fans
to sell to you

259
00:22:04,022 --> 00:22:08,618
You look familiar

260
00:22:09,561 --> 00:22:12,496
but I have forgotten your name

261
00:22:12,597 --> 00:22:16,465
I am Cheung Yu Han,
and I sang at your residence

262
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:20,369
No wonder

263
00:22:23,675 --> 00:22:27,441
then you should know the famous Chi Guan

264
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:30,477
That is my pseudonym

265
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:33,649
What a pleasure!

266
00:22:33,752 --> 00:22:34,719
It's my honour!

267
00:22:36,154 --> 00:22:39,180
I love your "Bai Mei Jiao" most

268
00:22:39,291 --> 00:22:41,054
I must learn it today

269
00:22:41,159 --> 00:22:42,649
Come, over here

270
00:22:43,495 --> 00:22:45,122
I haven't sang that for a long time

271
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:47,528
I might get out of tune

272
00:22:47,632 --> 00:22:50,795
You're too modest, I long to hear it

273
00:22:50,902 --> 00:22:52,995
Alright then, your wish is my command

274
00:22:58,310 --> 00:23:02,041
You are delightedly a born beauty

275
00:23:02,147 --> 00:23:05,844
like a fairy having come from the
blue heavens

276
00:23:05,951 --> 00:23:09,614
At such a tender age

277
00:23:09,721 --> 00:23:17,127
happy couples are timely made

278
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:18,787
looking at the milky way high up
in the sky

279
00:23:18,897 --> 00:23:21,092
listening to drums beating

280
00:23:21,199 --> 00:23:29,868
holding lamps as they draw
the curtains stealthily

281
00:23:29,975 --> 00:23:30,964
Excellent

282
00:23:32,144 --> 00:23:33,907
Master Bao is getting out of line

283
00:23:34,012 --> 00:23:35,479
How could he befriend an actor?

284
00:23:36,081 --> 00:23:38,049
So what? Is not an actor a human being?

285
00:23:44,523 --> 00:23:46,787
This is what I carry with me

286
00:23:46,892 --> 00:23:48,883
Please accept it as a token

287
00:23:55,801 --> 00:23:57,166
Are you going just like that?

288
00:23:57,269 --> 00:23:58,736
The prince would not let you
go this easily

289
00:24:04,576 --> 00:24:10,742
An actor is basically a lowly person

290
00:24:10,849 --> 00:24:17,550
who laughs on stage and cries in silence

291
00:24:17,656 --> 00:24:24,289
slightly better than a whore
and a musician

292
00:24:24,396 --> 00:24:32,132
and even less than a dog

293
00:24:47,152 --> 00:24:48,346
Yu Han

294
00:24:50,822 --> 00:24:53,689
Have a safe trip and take care

295
00:25:01,132 --> 00:25:04,898
I heard your son gave this to Chi Guan

296
00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:08,899
Chi Guan is the actor of
our Jung Shuen palace

297
00:25:09,007 --> 00:25:11,305
and best-loved by the prince

298
00:25:11,409 --> 00:25:14,901
He has not returned to palace
for days and...

299
00:25:15,013 --> 00:25:19,416
is understood to have been closely
related to your son

300
00:25:19,518 --> 00:25:22,783
It's also your son's idea
he should leave the palace

301
00:25:23,955 --> 00:25:26,116
Please therefore convey to your son

302
00:25:26,224 --> 00:25:28,215
that Chi Guan should return to us

303
00:25:28,326 --> 00:25:31,454
Firstly the prince will
appreciate this, and

304
00:25:31,563 --> 00:25:35,158
secondly, you'll avoid
unnecessary troubles

305
00:25:41,006 --> 00:25:41,597
Come, men

306
00:25:41,706 --> 00:25:42,468
Yes

307
00:25:42,574 --> 00:25:43,438
Ask Bao Yu to come here

308
00:25:43,542 --> 00:25:44,270
Yes

309
00:25:52,017 --> 00:25:52,813
Master Bao

310
00:25:52,918 --> 00:25:54,510
Old master is calling you
and is very angry

311
00:25:56,688 --> 00:25:57,677
Wicked child

312
00:26:03,895 --> 00:26:04,884
Kneel down

313
00:26:07,999 --> 00:26:09,398
Kneel properly

314
00:26:10,936 --> 00:26:12,733
You beast

315
00:26:13,171 --> 00:26:15,002
Come, tie him up

316
00:26:15,106 --> 00:26:15,731
Yes

317
00:26:16,975 --> 00:26:22,140
You... you fail to glorify your ancestors

318
00:26:22,247 --> 00:26:25,375
and meddle with actors

319
00:26:25,483 --> 00:26:28,213
and have caused a scandal

320
00:26:29,821 --> 00:26:32,915
I'll beat you to death today

321
00:26:33,024 --> 00:26:35,857
so you won't ruin our family

322
00:26:38,463 --> 00:26:39,487
Prepare our family's cardinal punishment

323
00:26:39,598 --> 00:26:40,690
Yes

324
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:41,458
Really?

325
00:26:55,847 --> 00:26:56,745
Tell Madam quickly

326
00:26:58,717 --> 00:27:00,014
Beat him hard

327
00:27:00,118 --> 00:27:00,743
Yes

328
00:27:08,059 --> 00:27:11,028
Master Bao, yell loudly, quick

329
00:27:11,129 --> 00:27:13,290
Yell, yell out now

330
00:27:13,398 --> 00:27:14,922
Shout louder

331
00:27:17,002 --> 00:27:19,129
Louder still

332
00:27:19,671 --> 00:27:22,799
Heavens, to think our Jia family

333
00:27:22,907 --> 00:27:25,671
with its deep-rooted tradition,
eruditeness

334
00:27:25,777 --> 00:27:28,712
reputation and wealth

335
00:27:28,813 --> 00:27:31,475
...has produced such a no-good bastard

336
00:27:35,453 --> 00:27:36,442
Master Bao, Shout louder

337
00:27:36,554 --> 00:27:38,021
Louder still

338
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:42,858
Get out of my way

339
00:27:59,044 --> 00:28:00,033
Master

340
00:28:01,179 --> 00:28:07,914
Master...

341
00:28:08,019 --> 00:28:11,921
Bao Yu is guilty, yet you should
take care as well

342
00:28:12,023 --> 00:28:13,581
If you beat Bao Yu to death
that is not as serious as

343
00:28:13,692 --> 00:28:16,991
causing great distress to old madam

344
00:28:18,730 --> 00:28:19,992
Bao Yu

345
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:25,802
I am not filial to have raised such a kid

346
00:28:25,904 --> 00:28:28,532
I must kill him to prevent
further troubles

347
00:28:29,207 --> 00:28:31,402
Master...

348
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:34,076
Please look upon our marriage

349
00:28:34,179 --> 00:28:35,737
I am advanced in years

350
00:28:35,847 --> 00:28:38,145
and only have this one child

351
00:28:41,586 --> 00:28:46,956
Bao Yu, let us die together

352
00:28:48,126 --> 00:28:49,457
It's all your fault

353
00:28:49,561 --> 00:28:51,995
...to spoil him like this

354
00:28:52,097 --> 00:28:54,327
I must strangle him today

355
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:58,899
Get me a rope...

356
00:28:59,003 --> 00:29:00,493
Get me a rope

357
00:29:00,805 --> 00:29:03,069
Alright, if you must strangle him

358
00:29:03,174 --> 00:29:04,505
strangle me first

359
00:29:04,609 --> 00:29:14,211
Beat me to death first...

360
00:29:14,319 --> 00:29:19,484
Beat me to death first... then kill him

361
00:29:23,595 --> 00:29:25,529
Bao Yu, quick...

362
00:29:25,630 --> 00:29:28,224
Open it, open it

363
00:29:28,333 --> 00:29:30,767
You treated him like a thief. Bao Yu

364
00:29:30,869 --> 00:29:32,029
Bao Yu...

365
00:29:32,137 --> 00:29:33,502
Master Bao

366
00:29:33,605 --> 00:29:35,698
Bao Yu

367
00:29:39,744 --> 00:29:44,408
Bao Yu...

368
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:50,817
What does old madam want

369
00:29:50,922 --> 00:29:53,186
Just ask me to go in

370
00:29:53,291 --> 00:29:56,089
Why bother old madam to come herself

371
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:07,732
So you're talking to me

372
00:30:09,941 --> 00:30:12,603
I have some instructions to give

373
00:30:12,710 --> 00:30:14,644
Unfortunately I have not raised
a good child

374
00:30:14,746 --> 00:30:17,579
...in my whole life

375
00:30:18,416 --> 00:30:24,286
Who should I talk to? Who indeed?

376
00:30:28,927 --> 00:30:30,792
Instructions?

377
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:33,991
To whom do I dare give instructions?

378
00:30:39,103 --> 00:30:43,631
I train him up to glorify our ancestors

379
00:30:44,008 --> 00:30:46,909
Old madam, if you say so...

380
00:30:47,011 --> 00:30:50,003
how can I take it up?

381
00:30:58,356 --> 00:31:00,221
I have only said one sentence

382
00:31:00,325 --> 00:31:02,259
and already you can't take it

383
00:31:02,827 --> 00:31:06,092
How do you think then that Bao Yu

384
00:31:06,197 --> 00:31:08,961
could take the beating from
the wooden plank?

385
00:31:09,334 --> 00:31:11,529
Granny

386
00:31:12,737 --> 00:31:18,334
Bao Yu...

387
00:31:21,112 --> 00:31:26,812
You naughty, no-good grand child

388
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:31,480
Dilute it with wine and dress his wounds

389
00:31:31,589 --> 00:31:33,887
When the bruising disappears
he'll be alright

390
00:31:33,992 --> 00:31:35,152
Yes, Miss Bao

391
00:31:42,433 --> 00:31:44,025
Thank you, sister Bao

392
00:31:47,805 --> 00:31:49,033
You have to mend your ways

393
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:50,835
How can you be-friend an actor?

394
00:31:52,510 --> 00:31:53,909
Miss Bao is right

395
00:32:01,352 --> 00:32:04,185
Bao Yu, rest well

396
00:32:04,289 --> 00:32:05,085
I'm going

397
00:32:06,891 --> 00:32:07,983
Wouldn't you stay for a while?

398
00:32:09,093 --> 00:32:12,085
No, remember the medicine

399
00:32:12,196 --> 00:32:12,992
I know

400
00:33:03,915 --> 00:33:05,246
When did you come?

401
00:33:09,921 --> 00:33:12,947
What's the big deal with
this physical pain?

402
00:33:18,262 --> 00:33:19,889
You've suffered much

403
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:23,829
Even if I die for these people

404
00:33:23,935 --> 00:33:25,334
I am convinced it's worth it

405
00:33:49,727 --> 00:33:50,659
Yin Yang

406
00:33:51,629 --> 00:33:53,426
It's just a casual visit

407
00:33:53,931 --> 00:33:55,057
When master Bao awakes

408
00:33:55,166 --> 00:33:57,066
second madam will come over with old madam

409
00:33:57,168 --> 00:33:58,157
I'm going back

410
00:34:05,276 --> 00:34:06,174
Farewell

411
00:34:08,246 --> 00:34:09,508
Stay longer

412
00:34:09,981 --> 00:34:12,176
I can't let people see my eyes

413
00:34:38,142 --> 00:34:40,235
Ching Man...

414
00:34:42,246 --> 00:34:43,440
Master Bao, can I help you?

415
00:34:45,316 --> 00:34:47,284
Send this to Miss Lin

416
00:34:49,854 --> 00:34:51,151
I...

417
00:34:51,255 --> 00:34:52,483
Go on

418
00:35:18,683 --> 00:35:27,216
Tears weld in my eyes

419
00:35:27,325 --> 00:35:35,596
For whom do they fall

420
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:44,267
Hair scarf as a gift

421
00:35:44,375 --> 00:35:52,749
Grieve for the loved one

422
00:36:00,625 --> 00:36:12,059
His love is like filigree on
a handkerchief

423
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:23,638
while my heavy heart cries out
between each line

424
00:36:23,748 --> 00:36:35,751
If we were not meant for each other

425
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:47,237
why then do our hearts and souls unite

426
00:36:48,139 --> 00:36:57,070
If we were meant for each other

427
00:36:57,181 --> 00:37:09,855
why then do walls and mountains
separate us

428
00:37:47,465 --> 00:37:49,262
I don't care Miss Whoever she is

429
00:37:49,367 --> 00:37:50,766
They come here for no reason whatsoever...

430
00:37:50,868 --> 00:37:52,563
and disturb my sleep at night

431
00:37:55,206 --> 00:37:56,195
Who is it?

432
00:37:56,307 --> 00:37:57,103
It's me

433
00:37:57,208 --> 00:37:57,970
They're all asleep

434
00:37:58,809 --> 00:37:59,867
By master Bao's instructions

435
00:37:59,977 --> 00:38:01,342
No one is allowed to come in

436
00:38:25,336 --> 00:38:26,428
Miss Bao, are you leaving?

437
00:38:26,537 --> 00:38:27,299
Won't you stay a while longer?

438
00:38:33,844 --> 00:38:35,175
Have a safe trip and take care

439
00:38:35,913 --> 00:38:36,709
Go back

440
00:38:36,814 --> 00:38:37,678
Yes

441
00:38:55,199 --> 00:38:56,188
Think

442
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:58,393
You've been sold as a maid

443
00:38:58,836 --> 00:39:00,827
Who do you think you are? A Miss?

444
00:39:01,739 --> 00:39:03,434
Frankly, in this mansion

445
00:39:03,541 --> 00:39:04,030
if you don't know

446
00:39:04,141 --> 00:39:06,132
...how to play politics

447
00:39:06,243 --> 00:39:08,302
you will be finished

448
00:39:08,412 --> 00:39:09,811
I tell you, sooner or later

449
00:39:09,914 --> 00:39:10,403
you lazy bones will

450
00:39:10,514 --> 00:39:12,914
...be driven out

451
00:39:23,761 --> 00:39:31,566
Ou Shang terrace full of
floral extravagance

452
00:39:31,669 --> 00:39:39,075
Laughter and jokes prevail in Da Guan Yuan

453
00:39:39,176 --> 00:39:46,912
Mellifluous words abound in abundance

454
00:39:47,017 --> 00:39:55,891
The flow of sweet wine is endless

455
00:40:05,669 --> 00:40:19,072
But there is someone else here

456
00:40:19,183 --> 00:40:32,688
...suffering in deep melancholy

457
00:41:16,340 --> 00:41:22,336
Flowers fade and fall everywhere

458
00:41:22,446 --> 00:41:28,578
Who will sing their elegy?

459
00:41:28,686 --> 00:41:35,057
Sorrow permeates and lingers

460
00:41:35,159 --> 00:41:42,122
I will hoe the earth for the flowers

461
00:41:42,233 --> 00:41:48,661
Flowers bloom in extravagance
but fade in silence

462
00:41:48,772 --> 00:41:55,234
Melancholy weighs down the one
burying the flowers

463
00:41:55,346 --> 00:42:01,876
Lonely and in silence she cries

464
00:42:01,986 --> 00:42:07,947
Blood stains in the branches

465
00:42:08,926 --> 00:42:15,525
Follow the flowers to the ends
of the heavens

466
00:42:15,633 --> 00:42:22,266
There is no resting place
at the end of the heavens

467
00:42:22,373 --> 00:42:28,778
for the beautiful that has died

468
00:42:28,879 --> 00:42:34,943
The earth will cover romance that has gone

469
00:42:35,886 --> 00:42:42,655
People laugh at me burying the flowers

470
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:49,188
Who will be the one buried years from now?

471
00:42:49,300 --> 00:42:56,069
Time and tide waits for no beauty

472
00:42:56,173 --> 00:43:11,316
Flowers fade and people pass away

473
00:43:22,399 --> 00:43:27,496
Sister Lin...

474
00:43:31,909 --> 00:43:36,505
Please listen to me

475
00:43:44,188 --> 00:43:45,780
I know you're ignoring me

476
00:43:45,889 --> 00:43:47,288
I just want to say one thing

477
00:43:48,459 --> 00:43:51,019
From now on we walk on our own way

478
00:43:53,931 --> 00:43:54,955
Go on, speak

479
00:44:05,743 --> 00:44:07,404
What if I speak more?

480
00:44:13,250 --> 00:44:16,083
It's the past actions which determine
our present

481
00:44:21,925 --> 00:44:26,419
So what's the issue with
the present and the past?

482
00:44:30,034 --> 00:44:36,940
When you first came to my place

483
00:44:37,041 --> 00:44:44,743
we slept in the same bed

484
00:44:44,848 --> 00:44:52,084
What I told you is truly from my heart

485
00:44:52,189 --> 00:44:57,718
And I let you take my beloved stuff

486
00:44:57,828 --> 00:45:03,391
I feared the maids did not serve you well

487
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:09,063
and I prepared everything for you

488
00:45:09,173 --> 00:45:14,201
As soon as I see you frown

489
00:45:14,311 --> 00:45:20,307
I cheered you up

490
00:45:20,417 --> 00:45:27,983
You've now out-grown all this

491
00:45:28,092 --> 00:45:35,726
and treat me like an enemy

492
00:45:35,833 --> 00:45:42,739
Beat me and scold me if I'm at fault

493
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:47,402
but why treat me with such aloofness?

494
00:45:47,511 --> 00:45:54,212
If you are sad, speak out
and be done with it

495
00:45:54,318 --> 00:45:58,652
Why suffer in silence?

496
00:45:58,756 --> 00:46:05,025
I really don't understand you

497
00:46:05,129 --> 00:46:07,063
Why? Why do you ignore me?

498
00:46:07,164 --> 00:46:08,188
Why hide from me?

499
00:46:08,298 --> 00:46:10,289
I have to know if it's the last thing I do

500
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:14,803
What is the reason?

501
00:46:17,274 --> 00:46:20,869
Why? I was just going to ask you

502
00:46:20,978 --> 00:46:21,945
When I came the other day

503
00:46:22,045 --> 00:46:23,740
why didn't you ask the maid to
open the door?

504
00:46:24,114 --> 00:46:25,672
What?

505
00:46:26,216 --> 00:46:28,275
What do you mean?

506
00:46:28,886 --> 00:46:31,446
I swear I didn't, if I did let me
die right now

507
00:46:32,489 --> 00:46:35,151
I didn't do it, how could I admit it?

508
00:46:35,259 --> 00:46:36,886
One shouldn't swear in the morning

509
00:46:37,127 --> 00:46:39,561
I really didn't see you

510
00:46:39,663 --> 00:46:41,722
Even sister Bao only sat for a while
and went away

511
00:46:44,201 --> 00:46:45,964
Maybe the maids were too lazy to move

512
00:46:46,470 --> 00:46:48,802
and said you were asleep

513
00:46:50,974 --> 00:46:52,168
Wait till I find out who they were

514
00:46:52,276 --> 00:46:53,300
and I'll teach them a lesson

515
00:46:54,745 --> 00:46:56,042
They deserve it

516
00:46:57,014 --> 00:46:59,346
To have infuriated me is a small matter

517
00:46:59,449 --> 00:47:02,145
but to have made other Miss mad

518
00:47:02,252 --> 00:47:03,344
then it is a big problem

519
00:47:05,155 --> 00:47:08,921
You... are you infuriating me
or cursing me?

520
00:47:20,671 --> 00:47:23,504
Look, is this worth being so angry over?

521
00:47:37,788 --> 00:47:41,519
Sister Lin, don't worry

522
00:47:44,261 --> 00:47:45,956
What's there to worry?

523
00:47:46,597 --> 00:47:47,894
You really don't realise this?

524
00:47:50,133 --> 00:47:53,000
It's because of your worry that
you're still sick

525
00:47:53,704 --> 00:47:55,171
If you understood me more

526
00:47:55,272 --> 00:47:56,569
wouldn't you be better?

527
00:48:02,212 --> 00:48:05,477
Sister, let me say one more thing, okay?

528
00:48:11,188 --> 00:48:12,780
What's there to say?

529
00:48:13,290 --> 00:48:15,952
I understand what you have say

530
00:48:18,362 --> 00:48:19,351
Sister

531
00:48:42,586 --> 00:48:44,417
Was sister's cough better last night?

532
00:48:44,855 --> 00:48:46,049
Much better

533
00:48:51,595 --> 00:48:53,290
Amitabha

534
00:48:55,966 --> 00:48:58,594
Master Bao, even you are
reciting prayers now?

535
00:49:00,370 --> 00:49:02,565
This is a sign of desperation

536
00:49:08,845 --> 00:49:11,211
Ji Juan, you wear such thin clothes

537
00:49:11,315 --> 00:49:13,977
Be careful you don't catch a cold,
sister Lin is sick

538
00:49:14,084 --> 00:49:15,642
and if you're sick, what should we do?

539
00:49:16,219 --> 00:49:17,709
Go, put on more clothing

540
00:49:20,057 --> 00:49:22,890
Master Bao, when you speak

541
00:49:22,993 --> 00:49:24,460
keep your hands to yourself

542
00:49:25,662 --> 00:49:27,254
You're now a grown-up

543
00:49:27,364 --> 00:49:29,389
if people saw it they'll gossip

544
00:49:29,933 --> 00:49:31,764
Miss Lin said the other day

545
00:49:31,868 --> 00:49:33,859
You can't be like a child anymore

546
00:49:33,971 --> 00:49:35,563
You ought to behave properly
with the ladies

547
00:49:35,672 --> 00:49:36,969
You must learn to respect propriety

548
00:49:37,741 --> 00:49:38,901
Look

549
00:49:39,009 --> 00:49:42,172
Miss Lin is staying away from you

550
00:51:25,382 --> 00:51:30,319
Ji Juan, Master Bao is sulking outside

551
00:51:30,420 --> 00:51:32,479
Go and see what's wrong

552
00:51:35,859 --> 00:51:37,918
Take it, I'll take a look

553
00:52:07,824 --> 00:52:11,282
Master Bao...

554
00:52:13,029 --> 00:52:15,395
What are you dong here all by yourself?

555
00:52:20,337 --> 00:52:21,770
Grown up

556
00:52:22,272 --> 00:52:23,296
Grown up?

557
00:52:25,308 --> 00:52:27,606
What's the big deal about having grown up?

558
00:52:29,546 --> 00:52:32,413
They get married and leave

559
00:52:37,487 --> 00:52:38,920
They don't bother with me any more

560
00:52:43,793 --> 00:52:49,129
Isn't that so true?

561
00:52:49,232 --> 00:52:53,362
Even Miss Lin is returning to Soo Chow

562
00:52:58,041 --> 00:52:59,531
Nonsense

563
00:53:02,812 --> 00:53:05,144
There's no one in her home now

564
00:53:05,248 --> 00:53:06,146
Why would she want to go back?

565
00:53:07,350 --> 00:53:08,977
Do you think I'm fooling you?

566
00:53:09,619 --> 00:53:13,555
Miss Lin will be going home next year

567
00:53:14,958 --> 00:53:18,860
You are lying

568
00:53:19,596 --> 00:53:21,621
I know

569
00:53:21,998 --> 00:53:27,959
You only have the Xue family in your heart

570
00:53:28,471 --> 00:53:34,876
You forget Lin is also a big family

571
00:53:34,978 --> 00:53:37,208
Miss Lin is not a member of the Jia family

572
00:53:37,314 --> 00:53:44,516
How can Miss Lin be married
from the Jia family

573
00:53:44,621 --> 00:53:47,249
A swallow must return to its old nest

574
00:53:47,357 --> 00:53:57,130
Besides, Miss Lin's marriage
has been pre-arranged

575
00:53:57,234 --> 00:53:59,031
Miss says

576
00:53:59,869 --> 00:54:04,829
...she is prepared to return
what you gave her

577
00:54:04,941 --> 00:54:12,712
and you should return what she gave you

578
00:54:33,536 --> 00:54:37,404
Master Bao...

579
00:54:38,208 --> 00:54:43,805
Master Bao...

580
00:54:44,981 --> 00:54:48,280
Master Bao...

581
00:54:48,385 --> 00:54:50,250
Master Bao, what's wrong with you?

582
00:54:50,353 --> 00:54:54,153
Master Bao...

583
00:54:54,257 --> 00:54:56,054
Bao Yu

584
00:54:57,727 --> 00:54:59,922
Bao Yu...

585
00:55:00,597 --> 00:55:04,795
Bao Yu...

586
00:55:04,901 --> 00:55:07,495
Brother Bao...

587
00:55:07,604 --> 00:55:08,901
Master Bao

588
00:55:09,005 --> 00:55:13,601
Master Bao...

589
00:55:14,611 --> 00:55:16,078
Ji Juan

590
00:55:16,179 --> 00:55:18,147
Ji Juan, you can't leave

591
00:55:18,248 --> 00:55:27,646
If you must, we'll leave together

592
00:55:29,993 --> 00:55:31,119
What's the matter?

593
00:55:32,095 --> 00:55:33,562
Ji Juan

594
00:55:33,663 --> 00:55:35,187
What's going on?

595
00:55:36,099 --> 00:55:37,396
Tell me what's going on

596
00:55:37,767 --> 00:55:41,703
I... I only joked with master Bao

597
00:55:41,805 --> 00:55:42,772
I said...

598
00:55:42,872 --> 00:55:46,103
Miss Lin will be returning to Soo Chow

599
00:55:46,209 --> 00:55:48,507
then he...

600
00:55:49,145 --> 00:55:50,737
So, it's like this

601
00:55:50,847 --> 00:55:52,075
Old madam

602
00:55:52,182 --> 00:55:54,480
Lin said Prince Bei Jing will give
master Bao a boat

603
00:55:54,584 --> 00:55:55,482
Ask them to carry it in

604
00:55:55,585 --> 00:55:56,609
Yes

605
00:55:57,487 --> 00:55:59,182
Oh no...

606
00:55:59,289 --> 00:56:02,019
The Lin family has come to
pick up Miss Lin

607
00:56:02,125 --> 00:56:03,956
Get them out...

608
00:56:04,060 --> 00:56:06,153
Okay... get them out...

609
00:56:06,262 --> 00:56:07,854
Quick...

610
00:56:07,964 --> 00:56:08,453
Yes

611
00:56:08,565 --> 00:56:10,590
Get them out...

612
00:56:10,700 --> 00:56:11,598
Go on

613
00:56:11,701 --> 00:56:15,000
Bao Yu, now you can relax

614
00:56:15,105 --> 00:56:16,902
Okay, Bao Yu will be fine

615
00:56:17,006 --> 00:56:18,803
From now on except sister Lin

616
00:56:18,908 --> 00:56:25,404
no one is allowed to go by the name of Lin

617
00:56:25,515 --> 00:56:28,006
No one by the name of Lin is allowed
in here

618
00:56:28,118 --> 00:56:30,086
and no one can say that name in here

619
00:56:30,186 --> 00:56:31,448
Do you hear?

620
00:56:31,554 --> 00:56:32,521
No one by the name of Lin is allowed
in here

621
00:56:32,622 --> 00:56:33,714
and no one can say that name in here

622
00:56:34,958 --> 00:56:36,118
Brother Bao

623
00:56:42,532 --> 00:56:44,432
Oh no, look...

624
00:56:44,534 --> 00:56:47,731
That boat has come to
fetch sister Lin, look

625
00:56:48,104 --> 00:56:56,978
The Lin family's boat has come to
pick up Miss Lin

626
00:56:57,614 --> 00:56:58,842
Depart

627
00:56:59,249 --> 00:57:00,614
Get the boat out of here quickly

628
00:57:00,717 --> 00:57:01,877
Get the boat out of here quickly

629
00:57:01,985 --> 00:57:03,646
Do it, quick

630
00:57:03,753 --> 00:57:06,586
Depart

631
00:57:11,127 --> 00:57:26,839
Sister Lin will never leave again

632
00:57:49,098 --> 00:57:51,999
Bao Yu has a strange illness

633
00:57:52,802 --> 00:57:55,930
Dai Yu 's condition is not stable either

634
00:57:57,774 --> 00:58:02,074
They were okay when they were
together as kids

635
00:58:02,178 --> 00:58:03,736
Now...

636
00:58:12,088 --> 00:58:15,114
Old madam you should let Bao Yu marry

637
00:58:15,225 --> 00:58:17,693
The auspicious event might bring
good fortune

638
00:58:19,729 --> 00:58:24,063
Bao Yu and Dai Yu are a good match, but...

639
00:58:24,167 --> 00:58:25,099
Right

640
00:58:25,201 --> 00:58:29,467
But sister Lin is too thin and frail

641
00:58:29,572 --> 00:58:34,373
Unlike Miss Bao who is healthy and proper

642
00:58:36,713 --> 00:58:39,614
Miss Bao is not bad

643
00:58:39,716 --> 00:58:41,081
If Bao Yu marries her

644
00:58:41,184 --> 00:58:44,449
maybe he'll recover and be mature

645
00:58:44,821 --> 00:58:46,288
Old madam you're right

646
00:58:49,125 --> 00:58:51,184
Good

647
00:58:51,294 --> 00:58:53,694
Since you think the Miss Bao is not bad

648
00:58:53,796 --> 00:58:54,990
It's decided then

649
00:58:58,768 --> 00:58:59,928
What, Yin Yang?

650
00:59:00,603 --> 00:59:01,831
Old madam

651
00:59:03,806 --> 00:59:05,205
Go ahead

652
00:59:06,743 --> 00:59:08,472
If Miss Lin know this

653
00:59:08,578 --> 00:59:10,546
she might not be able to take it

654
00:59:10,647 --> 00:59:13,241
Besides master Bao is impotent

655
00:59:13,349 --> 00:59:16,079
When Ji Juan said Miss Lin has to go home

656
00:59:16,185 --> 00:59:19,086
He already became like mad

657
00:59:22,125 --> 00:59:24,184
A family like ours

658
00:59:24,294 --> 00:59:27,195
if people knew

659
00:59:27,297 --> 00:59:29,094
...our children are like that

660
00:59:29,198 --> 00:59:31,029
we'll have no face

661
00:59:33,836 --> 00:59:39,468
Dai Yu is alright, but Bao Yu...

662
00:59:41,644 --> 00:59:43,009
This is a problem

663
00:59:44,581 --> 00:59:46,981
Not really, I have an idea

664
00:59:48,618 --> 00:59:49,880
Go ahead

665
00:59:57,293 --> 00:59:58,351
Leave us, all of you

666
00:59:58,461 --> 00:59:59,553
Yes

667
01:00:05,134 --> 01:00:06,260
Stop

668
01:00:07,837 --> 01:00:09,566
I tell you all

669
01:00:09,672 --> 01:00:11,902
whoever leaks this out

670
01:00:12,008 --> 01:00:13,498
I'll rip out your lips

671
01:00:13,610 --> 01:00:14,508
Yes

672
01:00:22,418 --> 01:00:23,350
Go on, speak

673
01:00:26,255 --> 01:00:33,286
We will use a plan

674
01:00:33,396 --> 01:00:40,734
...to switch the bride

675
01:00:40,837 --> 01:00:48,073
...by covering her face at the wedding

676
01:00:48,177 --> 01:00:55,515
asking Ji Juan to help her at the side

677
01:00:55,618 --> 01:01:03,047
Deceive Bao Yu that the bride
is sister Lin

678
01:01:03,159 --> 01:01:10,565
Hiding the truth for the time being

679
01:01:10,667 --> 01:01:18,438
When the situation is irreversible

680
01:01:18,541 --> 01:01:28,075
then nobody can do anything about it

681
01:01:55,545 --> 01:01:56,978
I forgot my handkerchief

682
01:01:57,080 --> 01:01:57,944
I'm going back to get it

683
01:02:14,330 --> 01:02:16,298
What's the matter with you?

684
01:02:17,233 --> 01:02:18,723
Even if I said something wrong

685
01:02:18,835 --> 01:02:20,496
my sister shouldn't have smacked me

686
01:02:21,237 --> 01:02:22,932
What did you say?

687
01:02:23,239 --> 01:02:25,673
They forbade me to tell you
but I'm bent on doing so

688
01:02:25,775 --> 01:02:27,402
It's nothing bad, what's to fear?

689
01:02:27,510 --> 01:02:28,909
It's a good match

690
01:02:29,979 --> 01:02:31,207
A good match?

691
01:02:31,314 --> 01:02:33,874
Yes, master Bao is going to marry Miss Bao

692
01:02:38,821 --> 01:02:39,651
What?

693
01:02:39,756 --> 01:02:41,587
Master Bao is going to marry Miss Bao

694
01:02:45,361 --> 01:02:58,866
The news has shocked her so much

695
01:02:59,942 --> 01:03:08,873
that she became weak

696
01:03:11,721 --> 01:03:24,862
All became silent

697
01:03:32,542 --> 01:03:34,942
Miss...

698
01:03:36,012 --> 01:03:38,412
Miss, where are you going?

699
01:03:40,783 --> 01:03:46,312
I... l'm going to ask Bao Yu

700
01:03:47,623 --> 01:03:48,817
Miss

701
01:04:34,637 --> 01:04:35,399
Miss

702
01:04:35,504 --> 01:04:36,869
Miss Lin...

703
01:04:39,508 --> 01:04:41,533
Miss

704
01:05:07,870 --> 01:05:12,170
Miss, please go back to take your medicine

705
01:05:16,612 --> 01:05:20,048
Bao Yu, you're sick

706
01:05:22,685 --> 01:05:23,913
I'm sick

707
01:05:25,721 --> 01:05:27,211
Why are you sick?

708
01:05:27,323 --> 01:05:30,622
I...

709
01:05:34,397 --> 01:05:36,422
I am sick because of Miss Lin

710
01:05:40,036 --> 01:05:41,367
Your heart?

711
01:05:41,470 --> 01:05:44,166
My heart...

712
01:05:45,841 --> 01:05:52,610
my heart is with Miss Lin

713
01:05:57,353 --> 01:06:04,088
Everything is a sham

714
01:06:04,193 --> 01:06:09,995
One dolefully lamenting

715
01:06:10,099 --> 01:06:17,562
The other full of cares

716
01:06:18,941 --> 01:06:26,370
One like the reflection of the moon
in the water

717
01:06:26,482 --> 01:06:33,320
The other like a flower's reflection
in the mirror

718
01:06:52,274 --> 01:06:55,334
Miss...

719
01:07:16,432 --> 01:07:24,703
How much can you cry?

720
01:07:24,807 --> 01:07:39,586
How can one stop nature take its course?

721
01:07:47,496 --> 01:07:48,520
Are you all clear?

722
01:07:48,631 --> 01:07:49,689
Yes

723
01:07:49,799 --> 01:07:50,766
Remember

724
01:07:51,734 --> 01:07:52,530
Yes

725
01:08:03,646 --> 01:08:06,444
Really? I can marry sister Lin?

726
01:08:07,149 --> 01:08:09,811
Yes, but madam Lien said

727
01:08:09,919 --> 01:08:11,819
if you keep displaying your antics

728
01:08:11,921 --> 01:08:13,013
then you'll not be allowed to do so

729
01:08:13,422 --> 01:08:16,755
Who says I'm sick or mad?

730
01:08:16,859 --> 01:08:19,760
My heart is with sister Lin

731
01:08:19,862 --> 01:08:21,727
Now that I can marry her

732
01:08:21,831 --> 01:08:23,628
my heart is returned and I'm well again

733
01:08:26,202 --> 01:08:30,138
You don't believe it?

734
01:08:32,141 --> 01:08:34,439
Okay, I'll recite the books for you

735
01:08:37,113 --> 01:08:39,172
Proper relations & virtues are
one's basic obligations

736
01:08:39,281 --> 01:08:41,272
To be loyal to your emperor

737
01:08:41,383 --> 01:08:43,317
To be filial to your father

738
01:08:44,854 --> 01:08:46,685
Am I recovered?

739
01:08:49,425 --> 01:08:51,188
Am I?

740
01:08:52,294 --> 01:08:55,821
I tell you I'm not sick

741
01:08:56,432 --> 01:08:58,263
My sickness is because of their pressure

742
01:08:58,901 --> 01:09:02,530
I tell you I'm not sick,
they caused my sickness

743
01:09:13,716 --> 01:09:14,705
Ji Juan

744
01:09:16,452 --> 01:09:18,283
Master Bao is really going to marry...

745
01:09:24,193 --> 01:09:26,184
Master Bao is really going to
marry Miss Bao

746
01:09:26,862 --> 01:09:28,420
lt'll take place tonight

747
01:09:28,531 --> 01:09:30,658
The couple's room is separately arranged

748
01:09:32,368 --> 01:09:33,926
Everyone is aware

749
01:09:34,036 --> 01:09:35,594
I only heard of this indirectly

750
01:09:35,704 --> 01:09:38,195
The orders were that we are not
supposed to know

751
01:09:41,610 --> 01:09:45,376
These people are so cruel

752
01:09:48,551 --> 01:09:52,954
Bao Yu, I think if she's dead tomorrow

753
01:09:53,055 --> 01:09:54,716
You are shameless to come to see me

754
01:09:55,324 --> 01:09:56,723
Miss Ji Juan

755
01:10:00,429 --> 01:10:01,657
What is it? Madam Chow

756
01:10:01,764 --> 01:10:02,992
How is Miss Lin?

757
01:10:06,802 --> 01:10:09,635
Second madam and old madam
discussed this just now

758
01:10:09,738 --> 01:10:11,672
You are needed over there

759
01:10:12,575 --> 01:10:16,568
Sure, no problem

760
01:10:16,679 --> 01:10:20,274
Madam Chow you go first.
After Miss Lin was dead

761
01:10:20,382 --> 01:10:22,407
We'll wait on you

762
01:10:23,719 --> 01:10:27,678
It's just that Miss Lin is still alive

763
01:10:27,790 --> 01:10:28,688
Miss

764
01:10:31,393 --> 01:10:34,055
You can say this to me

765
01:10:34,163 --> 01:10:36,063
but how am I going to report this?

766
01:10:36,565 --> 01:10:37,725
Report it as it is

767
01:10:38,100 --> 01:10:40,159
What? There'll be big trouble

768
01:10:40,269 --> 01:10:41,998
What trouble?

769
01:10:47,343 --> 01:10:48,605
Suet Ngan, come with me

770
01:10:49,178 --> 01:10:49,803
No

771
01:10:49,912 --> 01:10:51,311
What, no one will go?

772
01:10:51,714 --> 01:10:53,841
They will not spare us, come

773
01:10:53,949 --> 01:10:57,749
Sister Ji Juan...

774
01:11:13,302 --> 01:11:18,535
I spend nights and days with you

775
01:11:18,641 --> 01:11:23,738
How could I bear seeing you like this

776
01:11:23,846 --> 01:11:29,079
I prepare your medicine, and you reject it

777
01:11:29,184 --> 01:11:34,383
I prepare your food, yet you refuse it

778
01:11:34,490 --> 01:11:45,424
Look at you, you're faded like a flower

779
01:11:45,534 --> 01:11:55,068
Your tears on the pillow are heavy
as the Autumn rain

780
01:11:55,944 --> 01:12:06,343
Miss, melancholy has caused your illness

781
01:12:06,455 --> 01:12:13,952
You dote too much

782
01:12:14,697 --> 01:12:25,540
The icy wind chills the leaves

783
01:12:25,641 --> 01:12:33,571
and night embraces the milky way

784
01:12:33,682 --> 01:12:41,987
Cease shedding tears

785
01:12:42,091 --> 01:12:50,328
Keep yourself well

786
01:12:50,432 --> 01:12:58,305
Nurture your frail spirit

787
01:12:58,407 --> 01:13:06,109
Groom your beautiful self

788
01:13:06,215 --> 01:13:14,384
Smooth your frowning brows

789
01:13:14,490 --> 01:13:25,799
Close your book of distress

790
01:13:31,306 --> 01:13:42,046
What's the use of food and medicine?

791
01:13:42,151 --> 01:13:53,153
Even a panacea will not cure me

792
01:13:53,262 --> 01:14:03,638
I was born more evanescent than dew

793
01:14:03,739 --> 01:14:14,513
My frail body is like a candle in the wind

794
01:14:14,616 --> 01:14:25,254
Flowers falling with one sweep of the wind

795
01:14:25,360 --> 01:14:34,598
Beauty and colour are gone with one
fell swoop

796
01:14:34,703 --> 01:14:46,843
Sister, do not miss me

797
01:14:46,949 --> 01:14:58,656
We meet and depart like the rising
and ebbing tide

798
01:15:03,198 --> 01:15:19,445
Miss, why say such sad things

799
01:15:19,548 --> 01:15:30,391
A good person like you should have
a good ending

800
01:15:30,492 --> 01:15:41,027
There must be good medicine for sickness

801
01:15:41,136 --> 01:15:51,376
Besides, the whole family loves you

802
01:15:51,480 --> 01:16:04,689
and great granny loves you like treasure

803
01:16:04,793 --> 01:16:14,725
All sisters treat you as one of their own

804
01:16:14,836 --> 01:16:17,805
Ji Juan, Stop it

805
01:16:19,474 --> 01:16:27,176
Stop talking about this family

806
01:16:28,850 --> 01:16:44,460
they are all insensitive to
others' feelings

807
01:17:09,558 --> 01:17:11,685
Congratulations...

808
01:17:35,484 --> 01:17:36,883
Miss

809
01:17:39,788 --> 01:17:41,153
Chafer

810
01:17:58,140 --> 01:18:05,342
Looking back at our old dreams

811
01:18:05,447 --> 01:18:12,683
I regretted to send letter to Bao Yu

812
01:18:12,788 --> 01:18:20,092
We setup the Begonia Club

813
01:18:20,195 --> 01:18:26,725
for us to write poems

814
01:18:27,769 --> 01:18:35,073
Playing games over at Yi Hung Mansion

815
01:18:35,177 --> 01:18:42,481
Scoring old songs at the
Shiau Shiang Mansion

816
01:18:42,584 --> 01:18:50,252
Tears persist though love has ended

817
01:18:50,358 --> 01:18:57,321
The silk worm regrets to leave
its silk when it died

818
01:19:07,576 --> 01:19:15,642
You can't tell the tear
and ink marks on the paper

819
01:19:15,751 --> 01:19:23,920
Who say lovers are more sentimental

820
01:19:24,025 --> 01:19:31,090
Let my heart and blood become ashes

821
01:19:31,199 --> 01:19:37,934
Even the heaven and the mortals
unaware of it

822
01:19:56,892 --> 01:19:58,883
Miss

823
01:20:05,467 --> 01:20:13,101
I mourn Spring's farewell
and flowers' fading

824
01:20:13,208 --> 01:20:20,979
I mourn the coming of Fall's deluge

825
01:20:21,082 --> 01:20:29,319
two lonely hearts

826
01:20:29,424 --> 01:20:37,422
tears drown the heart of Ji Juan

827
01:22:06,988 --> 01:22:09,456
Great granny, the bride and groom are here

828
01:22:49,431 --> 01:22:54,733
Miss...

829
01:22:59,407 --> 01:23:03,070
Miss...

830
01:23:36,711 --> 01:23:40,738
Sister Lin...

831
01:23:40,849 --> 01:23:42,407
Are you better?

832
01:23:48,690 --> 01:23:50,715
Why are you covered in this?

833
01:23:50,825 --> 01:23:52,452
Why do we use such trite politeness?

834
01:23:52,994 --> 01:23:54,484
Brother Bao

835
01:24:01,002 --> 01:24:02,469
Come here

836
01:24:02,904 --> 01:24:06,237
Aren't you concerned others might
laugh at you?

837
01:24:06,608 --> 01:24:08,838
You should know what is propriety

838
01:24:08,943 --> 01:24:10,934
Be gentle

839
01:24:11,046 --> 01:24:13,514
You're not shy but the bride does

840
01:24:13,615 --> 01:24:15,344
Right, Bao Yu

841
01:24:15,450 --> 01:24:17,611
You're a man now

842
01:24:17,719 --> 01:24:21,917
I wish you both long life and happiness

843
01:24:22,023 --> 01:24:23,149
Be gentle

844
01:24:23,425 --> 01:24:24,858
My heart is with her already

845
01:24:24,959 --> 01:24:26,551
Would I not be gentle with her?

846
01:24:26,661 --> 01:24:29,221
Bao Yu, come

847
01:24:33,635 --> 01:24:36,399
You must remember this

848
01:24:36,504 --> 01:24:38,472
It's for your own good

849
01:24:38,573 --> 01:24:39,801
I know

850
01:24:47,849 --> 01:24:49,248
Be careful

851
01:25:10,805 --> 01:25:16,368
My mother died when I was a mere child!

852
01:25:16,478 --> 01:25:22,576
My father was sacrificed in Kwong Lin

853
01:25:22,684 --> 01:25:28,623
I'm seeking shelter at grandmother's home

854
01:25:28,723 --> 01:25:33,888
Someone from a different family
is treated differently

855
01:25:34,262 --> 01:25:39,928
Thank you for taking care of me

856
01:25:40,034 --> 01:25:46,064
If it weren't for you

857
01:25:46,174 --> 01:25:52,010
who would keep me company day and night

858
01:25:52,113 --> 01:25:58,279
Doing sewing and embroidery early
in the morning

859
01:25:58,386 --> 01:26:10,423
Having a close relation during
our childhood

860
01:26:10,532 --> 01:26:22,637
But the west wind brings me
to the spirit world

861
01:26:22,744 --> 01:26:28,580
Don't burn for me paper money
at the Ghost festival

862
01:26:28,683 --> 01:26:34,815
Neither would I need respects
at Ching Ming occasion

863
01:26:34,923 --> 01:26:40,691
Each year this time when it becomes quiet

864
01:26:40,795 --> 01:26:46,290
Call my name a few times
at the bamboo forest

865
01:26:46,401 --> 01:26:48,164
Miss

866
01:26:55,810 --> 01:26:59,610
Ji Juan, I have to ask you for a favour

867
01:26:59,948 --> 01:27:04,612
I have no family here

868
01:27:04,719 --> 01:27:07,950
Till now I am honest and chaste

869
01:27:08,056 --> 01:27:11,355
No matter what, you ask them
to send me back

870
01:27:11,559 --> 01:27:17,555
I'd rather die in a virtuous place

871
01:27:17,665 --> 01:27:29,441
I don't want to be buried in an
immoral surrounding

872
01:27:30,144 --> 01:27:35,241
I don't want to be buried in a dirty place

873
01:28:18,059 --> 01:28:23,463
Bao Yu... you...

874
01:28:24,832 --> 01:28:27,494
Miss...

875
01:28:30,071 --> 01:28:32,733
Miss!

876
01:28:43,518 --> 01:28:49,582
It's difficult to search for a potion
for love

877
01:28:49,691 --> 01:28:56,255
The heavens should weep for
star-crossed lovers

878
01:28:56,364 --> 01:29:02,667
Dai Yu died at the Shiau Shiang Mansion

879
01:29:02,770 --> 01:29:09,073
Life's grievances are lengthy as the river

880
01:30:15,276 --> 01:30:18,404
Where am I? Where am I?

881
01:30:18,946 --> 01:30:21,437
Am I dreaming?

882
01:30:21,549 --> 01:30:23,380
What are you talking about?

883
01:30:23,484 --> 01:30:24,746
Granny is sitting right here

884
01:30:24,852 --> 01:30:27,047
Old master and guests are
in the Rung Shi Hall

885
01:30:28,856 --> 01:30:30,289
What are you doing?

886
01:30:32,026 --> 01:30:35,086
You tell me

887
01:30:35,196 --> 01:30:36,163
Who is that?

888
01:30:36,831 --> 01:30:38,355
Your new bride

889
01:30:39,133 --> 01:30:42,102
I'm confused. Who is my bride?

890
01:30:48,509 --> 01:30:49,635
Miss Bao

891
01:30:51,145 --> 01:30:52,271
Miss Bao

892
01:30:54,248 --> 01:30:55,579
So what about Miss Lin?

893
01:30:55,683 --> 01:30:57,742
Old master arranged your marriage
to Miss Bao

894
01:30:58,352 --> 01:31:00,081
Yes...

895
01:31:00,188 --> 01:31:02,349
It had been Miss Bao all along

896
01:31:06,427 --> 01:31:08,486
You're married to Miss Bao

897
01:31:09,897 --> 01:31:11,558
It's Miss Bao

898
01:31:11,666 --> 01:31:12,564
Yes

899
01:31:12,667 --> 01:31:13,827
Miss Bao?

900
01:31:14,769 --> 01:31:16,202
Miss Bao?

901
01:31:17,572 --> 01:31:20,598
Granny, what is going on here?

902
01:31:20,708 --> 01:31:22,232
What is going on here?

903
01:31:23,578 --> 01:31:26,775
Bao Yu, you're married Miss Bao

904
01:31:28,049 --> 01:31:31,485
Why are you mad like this?

905
01:31:32,687 --> 01:31:34,279
It's Miss Bao

906
01:31:35,256 --> 01:31:38,316
I am sure I married sister Lin

907
01:31:38,426 --> 01:31:40,792
Suet Ngan helped her

908
01:31:42,330 --> 01:31:44,161
How could she have become someone else?

909
01:31:45,333 --> 01:31:46,823
Why?

910
01:31:47,969 --> 01:31:54,204
Oh why?

911
01:31:56,644 --> 01:31:58,407
Bao Yu

912
01:32:01,048 --> 01:32:02,015
Great granny

913
01:32:02,116 --> 01:32:02,639
Old madam

914
01:32:02,750 --> 01:32:03,842
Great granny

915
01:32:03,951 --> 01:32:04,747
Old madam...

916
01:32:04,852 --> 01:32:07,912
Never mind

917
01:32:08,022 --> 01:32:10,013
Things will work themselves out

918
01:32:13,928 --> 01:32:17,261
Sister Lin

919
01:32:20,301 --> 01:32:24,431
Bao Yu...

920
01:32:32,179 --> 01:32:33,146
Bao Yu

921
01:32:33,247 --> 01:32:34,305
Brother Bao

922
01:32:34,749 --> 01:32:41,279
I thought this wedding night
was auspicious

923
01:32:41,989 --> 01:32:49,919
but it is a tragedy of errors

924
01:32:50,031 --> 01:32:56,527
Who made the swap

925
01:32:57,271 --> 01:33:04,973
Why has the turtledove occupied
the magpie's nest

926
01:33:05,079 --> 01:33:13,578
Granny loves me like treasure

927
01:33:14,221 --> 01:33:24,790
why has she deceived me too?

928
01:33:26,100 --> 01:33:34,906
Sister Bao knew I was in love
with sister Lin

929
01:33:35,009 --> 01:33:44,509
Why has she forced me into such suffering?

930
01:33:45,886 --> 01:33:55,693
Sister Lin, my love for you hasn't changed

931
01:33:55,796 --> 01:33:56,854
Brother Bao

932
01:33:57,298 --> 01:33:58,629
Master Bao

933
01:33:58,733 --> 01:33:59,893
Bao Yu

934
01:34:00,501 --> 01:34:00,967
Brother Bao

935
01:34:01,068 --> 01:34:02,194
Master Bao

936
01:34:03,104 --> 01:34:03,900
Bao Yu

937
01:34:04,005 --> 01:34:13,471
Born in the same bed and die
in the same coffin

938
01:34:15,583 --> 01:34:20,077
Granny, I want to die...

939
01:34:20,187 --> 01:34:21,347
Bao Yu

940
01:34:22,823 --> 01:34:26,919
Granny, there's something I must say

941
01:34:27,028 --> 01:34:30,191
Alright, go on...

942
01:34:30,297 --> 01:34:31,696
Great granny

943
01:34:34,235 --> 01:34:36,863
Sister Lin and I are sick

944
01:34:36,971 --> 01:34:39,439
and for the same reason

945
01:34:39,540 --> 01:34:44,773
One is full of melancholy,
the other full of hate

946
01:34:44,879 --> 01:34:50,044
Please put us together in one room

947
01:34:50,151 --> 01:34:55,521
so we could be with each other

948
01:34:55,623 --> 01:34:59,081
and spend our days together

949
01:34:59,193 --> 01:35:04,529
And we want to bury together after we died

950
01:35:05,099 --> 01:35:18,911
Oh, Great granny

951
01:35:19,013 --> 01:35:28,445
There is nothing else I want

952
01:35:31,625 --> 01:35:37,791
Just to live and die with sister Lin

953
01:35:40,067 --> 01:35:46,529
Bao Yu... this is your auspicious day

954
01:35:46,640 --> 01:35:49,040
Yet you're sick like this

955
01:35:49,477 --> 01:35:52,605
I feel such pain for you!

956
01:35:57,585 --> 01:35:59,610
Bao Yu, where are you going?

957
01:36:03,457 --> 01:36:04,981
Miss

958
01:36:07,962 --> 01:36:08,986
Bao Yu

959
01:36:14,702 --> 01:36:15,930
I'm going to find sister Lin

960
01:36:17,138 --> 01:36:21,905
Bao Yu, sister Lin is...

961
01:36:22,009 --> 01:36:24,136
She is already dead

962
01:36:28,783 --> 01:36:33,652
Bao Yu...

963
01:36:35,156 --> 01:36:39,616
- Master Bao...
- Bao Yu...

964
01:36:50,437 --> 01:36:53,531
"Spiritual Tablet of Dai Yu"

965
01:36:58,078 --> 01:37:11,219
Who? Who set this cruel trap

966
01:37:11,325 --> 01:37:17,195
...to separate us both

967
01:37:17,298 --> 01:37:24,363
Separating the two of us

968
01:37:24,471 --> 01:37:33,277
Sister Lin

969
01:37:34,081 --> 01:37:40,884
Sister Lin

970
01:37:41,355 --> 01:37:56,259
Until eternity I can call yet
there won't be response

971
01:37:58,172 --> 01:38:07,774
I grieve you're asleep alone in death

972
01:38:07,882 --> 01:38:20,625
I regret I could not even say farewell

973
01:38:20,728 --> 01:38:33,232
I feel remorse I could not be
your pall bearer

974
01:38:33,340 --> 01:38:35,672
Sister Lin

975
01:38:35,776 --> 01:38:50,680
Our love was like brother and sister

976
01:38:50,791 --> 01:38:58,357
it was sweet and innocent

977
01:38:58,465 --> 01:39:08,306
Bao Yu's love is true and sincere

978
01:39:08,409 --> 01:39:21,379
Sister you were full of woes
and yet you kept silent

979
01:39:21,488 --> 01:39:31,659
I pined for our wedding night and...

980
01:39:31,765 --> 01:39:41,970
thought our love would be
auspiciously consummated

981
01:39:42,076 --> 01:39:52,611
Little did I expect you would
become sister Bao

982
01:39:52,720 --> 01:40:05,861
and Shiau Shiang Mansion has become
Heng Wu Yuan

983
01:40:05,966 --> 01:40:14,897
My heart tripped and fell

984
01:40:15,009 --> 01:40:28,082
and realised you were forced to your death

985
01:40:28,188 --> 01:40:35,594
I was deceived by Suet Ngan

986
01:40:35,696 --> 01:40:43,762
who lured me to the nuptial room

987
01:40:43,871 --> 01:40:54,304
The scheme has caused your death

988
01:40:54,415 --> 01:41:04,518
I tear down the curtain fiercely

989
01:41:04,625 --> 01:41:15,058
Your tears are like blood
becoming the azalea flower

990
01:41:15,169 --> 01:41:30,108
Shiau Shiang Mansion remains the same

991
01:41:30,217 --> 01:41:49,058
but you the fairy of
Shiau Shiang Mansion are gone

992
01:42:11,024 --> 01:42:14,152
Miss was deeply saddened by the poems

993
01:42:17,531 --> 01:42:25,905
What elegant poetry!

994
01:42:26,006 --> 01:42:32,241
It has a lofty character

995
01:42:32,346 --> 01:42:38,512
It's written in blood and tears

996
01:42:38,619 --> 01:42:44,990
Why burn it?

997
01:42:45,092 --> 01:42:51,224
It's saturated with self-pity

998
01:42:51,331 --> 01:43:00,000
Nobody appreciates it, so why keep it?

999
01:43:10,751 --> 01:43:19,250
The jade zither is sister's bosom friend

1000
01:43:19,359 --> 01:43:25,764
it can interpret the melancholic rain

1001
01:43:25,866 --> 01:43:32,135
and play a tune with the clouds and moon

1002
01:43:32,239 --> 01:43:41,113
Now its strings are broken

1003
01:43:41,215 --> 01:43:52,092
so is my heart, and I have no more words

1004
01:43:52,192 --> 01:43:56,390
There is no audience for my sad song

1005
01:44:09,443 --> 01:44:15,404
The broomstick & the hoe
are used to bury flowers

1006
01:44:15,515 --> 01:44:21,511
Flowers fade and flowers bloom

1007
01:44:21,622 --> 01:44:29,859
Sister, you're like a white jade
buried in dirt

1008
01:44:29,963 --> 01:44:38,268
From now on I can only see
the flowers but not you

1009
01:44:38,372 --> 01:44:40,135
Master Bao, please go back

1010
01:44:40,741 --> 01:44:42,504
Your wife is waiting for you

1011
01:44:42,943 --> 01:44:51,681
This is a day for newly weds

1012
01:45:07,200 --> 01:45:12,866
Bao Yu... how are you?

1013
01:45:13,206 --> 01:45:15,834
Bao Yu...

1014
01:45:24,017 --> 01:45:27,180
Bao Yu... how are you?

1015
01:45:28,155 --> 01:45:39,293
Even the parrot knows of the love

1016
01:45:39,399 --> 01:45:43,301
The people simply cannot be compared

1017
01:45:52,512 --> 01:45:58,075
Master Bao, please go back,
it's almost dawn

1018
01:46:02,055 --> 01:46:03,920
It's almost dawn

1019
01:46:10,897 --> 01:46:12,694
It's almost dawn

1020
01:46:23,377 --> 01:46:25,743
The royal decree, kneel and receive it

1021
01:46:25,846 --> 01:46:28,212
Long live the king

1022
01:46:30,317 --> 01:46:33,343
Official Jia has been delinquent in duty

1023
01:46:33,453 --> 01:46:36,320
He failed the Emperor's trust
& shamed the ancestors

1024
01:46:36,423 --> 01:46:38,050
He is now dismissed from his post

1025
01:46:41,294 --> 01:46:44,457
The assets of the Jia family

1026
01:46:44,564 --> 01:46:47,727
...will now be confiscated by officials

1027
01:46:59,079 --> 01:47:06,315
Fate does not govern lovers' destinies

1028
01:47:06,420 --> 01:47:13,258
Clearly it's the red chamber dream's
mourning & sorrow

1029
01:47:13,827 --> 01:47:22,030
All debts are paid

1030
01:47:22,135 --> 01:47:27,368
Those who transcend joy and pain
take the monastic vow

1031
01:47:27,474 --> 01:47:35,540
Those yearning for love lose their lives

1032
01:47:36,783 --> 01:47:44,246
Like a forest where the birds are gone

1033
01:47:44,357 --> 01:47:55,996
...all that's left is a land forlorn!
