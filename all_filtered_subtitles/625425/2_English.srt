1
00:07:50,583 --> 00:07:52,291
Help!

2
00:08:24,666 --> 00:08:27,166
We need your father's email address.

3
00:08:27,916 --> 00:08:28,875
Stay calm.

4
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,416
Your father's email address.

5
00:08:33,458 --> 00:08:34,750
Do you understand?

6
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:43,333
Breathe calmly. In and out.

7
00:08:44,458 --> 00:08:46,708
Your father's email address.

8
00:08:48,541 --> 00:08:51,666
Your father's email address.

9
00:08:53,416 --> 00:08:55,833
Martin... M...

10
00:08:57,791 --> 00:08:59,833
at aol.de.

11
00:09:03,916 --> 00:09:07,375
And the mobile phone number.
Mobile phone number.

12
00:09:08,208 --> 00:09:09,666
0160...

13
00:09:10,583 --> 00:09:11,666
928...

14
00:09:12,958 --> 00:09:15,666
40184.

15
00:09:15,958 --> 00:09:16,791
Again.

16
00:09:17,833 --> 00:09:21,541
0160928...

17
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:25,333
40184.

18
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:55,791
Is everything okay?

19
00:09:55,875 --> 00:09:56,750
Yes.

20
00:10:04,791 --> 00:10:07,791
Put her cell with the other stuff.
We might still need it.

21
00:10:16,833 --> 00:10:19,083
COPYING FILES TO REMOVABLE MEDIA

22
00:10:24,375 --> 00:10:25,875
Check every ten minutes.

23
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:26,875
Okay.

24
00:10:37,375 --> 00:10:38,583
Lock the door behind me.

25
00:11:19,625 --> 00:11:22,208
Help. Help me!

26
00:11:54,625 --> 00:11:55,750
Was the email correct?

27
00:11:56,958 --> 00:11:58,083
No reply.

28
00:12:02,125 --> 00:12:03,541
Is she all right?

29
00:12:03,625 --> 00:12:04,541
Yes, all good.

30
00:12:28,291 --> 00:12:29,291
She needs to drink.

31
00:12:58,125 --> 00:12:59,166
You need fluids.

32
00:12:59,916 --> 00:13:01,916
We'll take out the gag so you can drink.

33
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,333
When we do that,
we don't want you to bite, spit or scream.

34
00:13:05,416 --> 00:13:07,875
Otherwise, we'll have to sedate you
and do it a different way.

35
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:09,875
Nod if you've understood this.

36
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:14,166
We don't want to hurt or kill you.

37
00:13:15,416 --> 00:13:17,333
But we're ready to do so at any time.

38
00:13:18,333 --> 00:13:19,166
You got that?

39
00:13:23,708 --> 00:13:26,333
I will now take the gag out.
Are you going to scream?

40
00:13:32,958 --> 00:13:34,958
Help! Hey!

41
00:13:35,041 --> 00:13:38,291
Nobody will hear you.
Nobody will help you.

42
00:13:38,375 --> 00:13:40,833
We're the only ones
who can get you out of here.

43
00:13:40,916 --> 00:13:43,125
We're your only friends now.

44
00:13:43,208 --> 00:13:44,500
Look at me.

45
00:13:45,875 --> 00:13:46,791
You understand?

46
00:13:50,583 --> 00:13:51,958
Will you scream
when I move my hand?

47
00:14:15,375 --> 00:14:16,250
Very good.

48
00:14:25,416 --> 00:14:27,125
We'll look after you.

49
00:14:27,208 --> 00:14:29,291
When you need to use the bathroom,
do this:

50
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:31,958
One finger for peeing, two for number two.

51
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:41,916
Eat. You need energy.

52
00:16:43,583 --> 00:16:45,583
-I'm not hungry.
-Doesn't matter, eat.

53
00:16:50,833 --> 00:16:51,666
Tom, please eat.

54
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:52,916
No, I really can't.

55
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:04,583
What?

56
00:17:09,291 --> 00:17:10,125
Eat.

57
00:17:11,666 --> 00:17:12,791
I said I'm not hungry.

58
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,666
You'll eat now.

59
00:17:19,583 --> 00:17:22,291
Okay.

60
00:17:34,583 --> 00:17:35,750
I said I'm not hungry.

61
00:17:35,833 --> 00:17:39,458
You haven't eaten in nine hours.
You worked hard, but you're not hungry?

62
00:17:39,541 --> 00:17:40,375
No.

63
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,041
-What's wrong?
-Nothing.

64
00:17:44,791 --> 00:17:47,166
You have to be honest or this won't work.

65
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:49,541
-Yes.
-You know how long I've planned this.

66
00:17:49,625 --> 00:17:50,666
I'm just not hungry.

67
00:17:55,833 --> 00:18:00,375
If you're not hungry, your emotions
are suppressing your appetite.

68
00:18:00,458 --> 00:18:02,375
Which means you're thinking too much.

69
00:18:03,458 --> 00:18:05,125
About whether we're doing
everything right.

70
00:18:06,625 --> 00:18:09,083
Whether we've made a mistake
that will send us back to prison.

71
00:18:10,166 --> 00:18:12,958
Whether she can identify us,
because then we're screwed.

72
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:14,875
We'd have to kill her.

73
00:18:18,041 --> 00:18:20,875
Or you're becoming soft,
now that we're really doing it.

74
00:18:20,958 --> 00:18:24,125
You have doubts. You wonder
whether we should let her go. Now.

75
00:18:25,791 --> 00:18:29,250
End it before it gets too complicated
to stop. Now while we still can.

76
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:34,166
Forget it, okay?

77
00:18:35,166 --> 00:18:36,000
Forget it.

78
00:18:36,625 --> 00:18:38,291
You and I will push through this.

79
00:18:39,208 --> 00:18:41,833
It's like prison.
You can't get out anymore.

80
00:18:41,916 --> 00:18:43,916
This is the plan
and the plan is happening now.

81
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,250
Doubting it is bullshit
and you know that. Say it.

82
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:50,583
What?

83
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,125
We will do this.

84
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:55,375
-We will do this.
-Say it again.

85
00:18:58,333 --> 00:18:59,291
We will do this.

86
00:19:03,666 --> 00:19:04,500
Good.

87
00:19:05,708 --> 00:19:07,375
Now eat. It will be a long night.

88
00:19:23,916 --> 00:19:25,541
What will you do with the money?

89
00:19:32,208 --> 00:19:33,166
None of your business.

90
00:19:39,625 --> 00:19:41,791
Okay. It's starting.

91
00:19:44,666 --> 00:19:46,083
Check every ten minutes, okay?

92
00:19:46,166 --> 00:19:49,125
The gag isn't safe
and we don't want her to choke, right?

93
00:19:55,958 --> 00:19:57,041
And lock the door behind me.

94
00:23:46,916 --> 00:23:47,750
I can't!

95
00:23:51,625 --> 00:23:53,041
Please give me some privacy.

96
00:23:55,083 --> 00:23:56,291
Could you go outside?

97
00:23:57,875 --> 00:23:59,083
Then turn around.

98
00:24:02,416 --> 00:24:03,250
Please.

99
00:24:08,708 --> 00:24:09,541
Please.

100
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,625
Stop. Give me the gun.

101
00:24:25,458 --> 00:24:27,291
Set me free or I'll shoot you.

102
00:24:27,375 --> 00:24:28,375
Okay, calm down.

103
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,458
I'll give you the keys.

104
00:24:30,541 --> 00:24:32,500
-Throw them over here.
-Wait.

105
00:24:32,583 --> 00:24:36,000
-Throw them over here.
-Calm down. I'll give them to you.

106
00:24:36,083 --> 00:24:38,416
-Stop right there.
-Take them, here.

107
00:24:39,458 --> 00:24:40,291
Take them.

108
00:24:40,375 --> 00:24:42,125
No! Stop right there!

109
00:24:42,208 --> 00:24:43,500
-Take them.
-Stop!

110
00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:50,750
Tom?

111
00:24:51,250 --> 00:24:52,666
Give me the gun.

112
00:24:52,750 --> 00:24:55,208
What are you doing here?

113
00:24:55,291 --> 00:24:56,250
Give it to me.

114
00:24:56,666 --> 00:24:59,250
Wait. You did this?

115
00:25:00,625 --> 00:25:01,833
Why?

116
00:25:03,541 --> 00:25:04,458
Are you serious?

117
00:25:05,791 --> 00:25:08,750
You know exactly why.
You ruined my life.

118
00:25:10,166 --> 00:25:11,291
So you kidnap me?

119
00:25:13,541 --> 00:25:14,500
Let me go.

120
00:25:15,083 --> 00:25:15,916
No.

121
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,083
Let me go!

122
00:25:18,166 --> 00:25:20,791
No, the plan has started.
Now give me the gun.

123
00:25:22,583 --> 00:25:23,791
Okay, Tom.

124
00:25:23,875 --> 00:25:25,208
-Wait a second.
-Give me the gun.

125
00:25:25,291 --> 00:25:27,875
Wait, I have to tell you something. Tom!

126
00:25:32,666 --> 00:25:33,500
No!

127
00:26:09,291 --> 00:26:12,916
It's your fault. You left me alone.

128
00:26:22,583 --> 00:26:23,583
And shut your face.

129
00:26:24,166 --> 00:26:28,083
If Vic finds out that we know each other,
if he notices anything, you're dead.

130
00:26:56,750 --> 00:26:57,750
Shit.

131
00:27:05,375 --> 00:27:07,583
Hey. Did everything work out?

132
00:27:07,833 --> 00:27:08,666
Yes.

133
00:27:12,541 --> 00:27:13,583
Is she okay?

134
00:27:14,833 --> 00:27:16,291
She's fine, I was just in there.

135
00:27:16,708 --> 00:27:17,541
Okay.

136
00:27:20,250 --> 00:27:21,208
He doesn't want to pay.

137
00:27:23,708 --> 00:27:24,666
Shit.

138
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:26,916
He will.

139
00:27:28,458 --> 00:27:29,375
You have to sleep.

140
00:27:29,625 --> 00:27:31,541
What? I can't sleep now.

141
00:27:31,625 --> 00:27:34,250
You need to rest.
Tomorrow will be exhausting.

142
00:27:36,125 --> 00:27:37,083
And who will check?

143
00:27:37,666 --> 00:27:38,500
Me.

144
00:27:40,250 --> 00:27:41,083
Lie down.

145
00:27:44,333 --> 00:27:45,166
If you say so.

146
00:28:11,541 --> 00:28:12,375
Sleep well.

147
00:28:28,333 --> 00:28:29,250
Tom.

148
00:28:32,625 --> 00:28:33,625
Wake up.

149
00:28:34,250 --> 00:28:36,625
Get up, I need you now.

150
00:28:39,125 --> 00:28:40,291
She might bleed.

151
00:28:41,208 --> 00:28:42,083
Stay focused.

152
00:28:42,583 --> 00:28:43,416
Okay, but...

153
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:44,875
Just stay focused.

154
00:28:47,750 --> 00:28:48,708
Get the camera.

155
00:29:20,458 --> 00:29:24,833
No matter how well you're prepared,
unexpected things can happen at any time.

156
00:29:25,833 --> 00:29:28,916
You then have to improvise
and make the best out of the situation.

157
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,125
Or you have a plan B.

158
00:29:32,958 --> 00:29:34,166
We have a plan B.

159
00:29:35,083 --> 00:29:36,791
Your father doesn't want to pay.

160
00:29:37,958 --> 00:29:39,958
So, we will show him again exactly

161
00:29:40,625 --> 00:29:41,625
what this is about.

162
00:29:42,458 --> 00:29:43,708
We will...

163
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:47,250
amputate your left pinky finger
just above the middle joint.

164
00:29:47,333 --> 00:29:48,750
No!

165
00:29:49,833 --> 00:29:51,041
-No!
-It will hurt.

166
00:29:51,541 --> 00:29:52,958
But it's not life-threatening.

167
00:29:54,625 --> 00:29:57,875
You won't lose much blood
and we will store the finger

168
00:29:59,208 --> 00:30:00,583
in here, cooled.

169
00:30:02,125 --> 00:30:05,125
The finger can be sewn on again
within 24 hours.

170
00:30:05,833 --> 00:30:06,666
If your father pays.

171
00:30:08,791 --> 00:30:10,625
No! No!

172
00:30:11,916 --> 00:30:13,000
Turn the camera on.

173
00:30:19,333 --> 00:30:22,500
Please don't!

174
00:30:22,583 --> 00:30:24,375
Tell your father.

175
00:30:26,125 --> 00:30:27,666
Tell your father.

176
00:30:28,833 --> 00:30:30,625
No!

177
00:30:31,416 --> 00:30:36,208
They'll cut my finger off.
Please do as they say.

178
00:30:36,958 --> 00:30:39,041
Help me, Dad.

179
00:30:40,750 --> 00:30:42,833
Please don't. No.

180
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:49,333
Dad, I love you and I'm sorry
we fought so often.

181
00:30:50,583 --> 00:30:52,375
Please help me.

182
00:30:52,916 --> 00:30:56,791
Dad! Dad, I'm pregnant.

183
00:30:57,708 --> 00:30:59,333
Four months pregnant.

184
00:31:00,625 --> 00:31:03,291
Please don't leave me alone.

185
00:31:04,625 --> 00:31:06,375
Please don't leave me alone.

186
00:31:06,750 --> 00:31:07,875
Please help me.

187
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,208
Please don't!

188
00:31:12,291 --> 00:31:13,833
No!

189
00:31:13,916 --> 00:31:14,916
I think that's enough.

190
00:31:22,583 --> 00:31:24,208
Please...

191
00:31:49,041 --> 00:31:51,000
-Don't do that again.
-What?

192
00:31:51,625 --> 00:31:52,458
I decide.

193
00:31:53,166 --> 00:31:54,000
Okay.

194
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,458
But we had what we needed.

195
00:32:10,458 --> 00:32:11,833
<i>No!</i>

196
00:32:12,458 --> 00:32:13,416
<i>No!</i>

197
00:32:14,333 --> 00:32:17,500
<i>Hello... Hello, Dad--</i>

198
00:32:24,791 --> 00:32:26,041
<i>No!</i>

199
00:32:26,791 --> 00:32:31,500
<i>No! Dad... I'm pregnant.</i>

200
00:32:32,708 --> 00:32:34,208
<i>Four months pregnant.</i>

201
00:32:34,875 --> 00:32:36,083
<i>Please!</i>

202
00:32:36,833 --> 00:32:39,375
<i>Help me!</i>

203
00:32:42,833 --> 00:32:46,750
<i>Please don't! Please! Do as they say.</i>

204
00:32:54,583 --> 00:32:55,416
It works.

205
00:32:56,875 --> 00:32:57,708
Okay.

206
00:32:59,250 --> 00:33:00,416
She was a great choice.

207
00:33:02,708 --> 00:33:03,833
Yes.

208
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:09,458
You need vitamins.

209
00:33:29,125 --> 00:33:30,166
Tom.

210
00:33:30,833 --> 00:33:31,666
What?

211
00:33:32,041 --> 00:33:32,916
Your mask.

212
00:33:35,166 --> 00:33:36,000
Right.

213
00:34:08,583 --> 00:34:09,666
You need to eat.

214
00:34:16,958 --> 00:34:17,958
This is minestrone.

215
00:34:21,375 --> 00:34:22,291
It's still hot.

216
00:34:30,625 --> 00:34:31,666
I want him to feed me.

217
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:39,333
No.

218
00:34:40,708 --> 00:34:41,541
I'll do it.

219
00:34:48,666 --> 00:34:49,583
Come on.

220
00:35:02,250 --> 00:35:03,541
This will be over soon.

221
00:35:23,041 --> 00:35:24,166
What is it?

222
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:26,833
What's up?

223
00:35:28,375 --> 00:35:29,250
Nothing.

224
00:35:47,250 --> 00:35:48,125
You see?

225
00:35:51,083 --> 00:35:52,458
If you play along, it's easier.

226
00:35:58,625 --> 00:35:59,708
What are you doing?

227
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:04,500
Go back.

228
00:36:40,166 --> 00:36:41,000
What are you doing?

229
00:36:48,666 --> 00:36:49,708
Give me that.

230
00:36:59,416 --> 00:37:01,000
I told you to give me that.

231
00:37:06,250 --> 00:37:07,250
Tie her up again.

232
00:37:32,291 --> 00:37:33,125
What's wrong?

233
00:37:34,208 --> 00:37:35,041
Nothing.

234
00:37:35,958 --> 00:37:36,791
Sure?

235
00:37:36,875 --> 00:37:37,958
Yes.

236
00:37:38,833 --> 00:37:39,666
Something's wrong.

237
00:37:39,750 --> 00:37:42,083
No, I'm just a little nervous.

238
00:37:42,166 --> 00:37:43,000
Why?

239
00:37:43,083 --> 00:37:44,791
Because of the excitement.

240
00:37:48,041 --> 00:37:49,250
You need to stay focused, Tom.

241
00:37:51,708 --> 00:37:52,583
I am.

242
00:37:53,541 --> 00:37:55,333
-Completely.
-You sure?

243
00:37:58,583 --> 00:38:00,083
I'm 100 percent fine.

244
00:38:04,833 --> 00:38:05,833
Pull yourself together.

245
00:38:07,125 --> 00:38:08,041
Sure.

246
00:38:18,625 --> 00:38:19,541
Where are you going?

247
00:38:21,291 --> 00:38:22,666
For a piss. Is that okay?

248
00:39:21,541 --> 00:39:22,375
Tom?

249
00:39:22,458 --> 00:39:23,416
Yes?

250
00:39:28,958 --> 00:39:30,208
Tom?

251
00:39:33,416 --> 00:39:34,541
Tom, what's wrong?

252
00:39:35,250 --> 00:39:36,583
Nothing. Everything's okay.

253
00:39:37,041 --> 00:39:37,875
You sure?

254
00:39:38,541 --> 00:39:40,458
Yes. I'll be done in a second.

255
00:39:47,208 --> 00:39:48,041
Tom!

256
00:39:48,791 --> 00:39:50,291
Open the door!

257
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,041
What are you doing?

258
00:39:53,125 --> 00:39:54,125
Nothing.

259
00:39:55,666 --> 00:39:57,625
Open the goddamn door!

260
00:39:58,708 --> 00:39:59,541
Tom!

261
00:40:01,916 --> 00:40:02,791
Tom!

262
00:40:03,833 --> 00:40:04,875
I'm coming in.

263
00:40:09,625 --> 00:40:10,541
What the fuck?

264
00:40:11,083 --> 00:40:12,833
Why didn't you open the door?
I was worried.

265
00:40:13,333 --> 00:40:14,500
I told you. I was almost done.

266
00:40:18,916 --> 00:40:20,041
I couldn't get rid of it.

267
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,875
I thought you only had to pee.

268
00:40:22,958 --> 00:40:24,083
I thought so, too.

269
00:40:24,458 --> 00:40:25,666
I can't smell anything.

270
00:40:27,416 --> 00:40:28,625
My digestion is fine.

271
00:40:30,750 --> 00:40:32,500
Damn, my shit just doesn't stink.

272
00:41:01,416 --> 00:41:02,500
It's the adrenaline.

273
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:08,500
Having to shit suddenly and the bitter
taste in your mouth. It's the adrenaline.

274
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:11,208
I used to have it. All the time.

275
00:41:12,666 --> 00:41:13,791
Really?

276
00:41:15,416 --> 00:41:17,333
It will stop. Relax.

277
00:41:20,166 --> 00:41:21,291
I'll send him the video,

278
00:41:21,375 --> 00:41:23,041
then I'll call him
and tell him the details.

279
00:41:24,583 --> 00:41:25,750
Then it will start.

280
00:41:30,708 --> 00:41:32,375
Once I'm back, we have to act quickly.

281
00:41:34,625 --> 00:41:36,541
We'll take her out
and downstairs to the van.

282
00:41:38,875 --> 00:41:41,041
In two days, this shit will be over.

283
00:41:43,291 --> 00:41:44,458
For good.

284
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,000
It will be over.

285
00:42:05,291 --> 00:42:08,041
We'll be free and rich.

286
00:42:11,416 --> 00:42:12,416
Sounds good.

287
00:42:15,708 --> 00:42:16,750
We'll pull it off.

288
00:42:18,458 --> 00:42:20,291
-Yes.
-Sure?

289
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:22,958
Sure.

290
00:43:10,166 --> 00:43:11,375
Why are you lying?

291
00:43:12,416 --> 00:43:13,500
-What?
-The pregnancy.

292
00:43:13,583 --> 00:43:14,958
Why should I believe that shit?

293
00:43:16,250 --> 00:43:17,291
Forget it.

294
00:43:18,458 --> 00:43:19,708
Tom, wait.

295
00:43:23,625 --> 00:43:24,583
Feel it.

296
00:43:30,041 --> 00:43:30,958
Come.

297
00:43:33,083 --> 00:43:34,000
Come.

298
00:43:36,541 --> 00:43:37,458
Feel it.

299
00:43:56,666 --> 00:43:57,541
Feel it.

300
00:44:04,166 --> 00:44:05,000
Properly.

301
00:44:13,625 --> 00:44:15,083
Sometimes I can already feel it.

302
00:44:17,083 --> 00:44:18,083
A little.

303
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,166
Can you feel something?

304
00:44:26,208 --> 00:44:27,125
I feel nothing.

305
00:44:29,375 --> 00:44:31,625
Because there is nothing.
Because you are lying again.

306
00:44:31,708 --> 00:44:33,458
-Tom.
-Shut up.

307
00:44:34,583 --> 00:44:36,375
And why didn't you tell me?

308
00:44:38,375 --> 00:44:39,458
Because I didn't want to.

309
00:44:40,833 --> 00:44:44,833
Because you had disappeared again.
Running around with someone, as always?

310
00:44:45,333 --> 00:44:48,083
And then you were gone for good.
In prison.

311
00:44:51,416 --> 00:44:52,250
Tom.

312
00:44:53,375 --> 00:44:54,375
Where is the other guy?

313
00:44:56,166 --> 00:44:57,083
He's gone.

314
00:44:58,208 --> 00:44:59,125
Calling someone.

315
00:44:59,208 --> 00:45:00,416
When will he be back?

316
00:45:01,666 --> 00:45:02,916
Half an hour. Maybe sooner.

317
00:45:04,875 --> 00:45:07,500
-You didn't tell him we know each other?
-Of course not.

318
00:45:09,333 --> 00:45:12,166
I told him I read your name
in an article about your father.

319
00:45:12,250 --> 00:45:13,083
What?

320
00:45:13,166 --> 00:45:15,208
He loved it and said you were perfect.

321
00:45:16,250 --> 00:45:19,291
Wealthy father, female, young, only child.

322
00:45:19,375 --> 00:45:20,208
What?

323
00:45:20,791 --> 00:45:23,208
-You fulfilled all the criteria.
-Criteria?

324
00:45:23,291 --> 00:45:26,833
Vic has been planning this forever.
He talked about nothing else in jail.

325
00:45:27,458 --> 00:45:29,333
When we got out,
we started looking for a victim.

326
00:45:30,875 --> 00:45:32,166
And you suggested me?

327
00:45:32,583 --> 00:45:33,500
Yes.

328
00:45:34,083 --> 00:45:37,875
Have you gone completely mad? What? Why?

329
00:45:37,958 --> 00:45:42,791
I was in jail.
I was waiting for you every fucking day.

330
00:45:42,875 --> 00:45:46,583
No visit, no explanation, nothing!
Fuck you, Stella!

331
00:45:46,666 --> 00:45:48,416
I should have known not to trust you.

332
00:45:48,500 --> 00:45:50,250
Exactly!

333
00:45:51,375 --> 00:45:54,541
Open your eyes for once, Tom!
It's always somebody else's fault.

334
00:45:55,541 --> 00:45:58,541
You promised
you would stop with all this shit.

335
00:45:58,625 --> 00:46:00,916
The burglaries, your fucked-up friends.

336
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,375
And then suddenly the cops
come to my place and arrest you.

337
00:46:03,458 --> 00:46:05,250
That's when you said you'd help me.

338
00:46:05,333 --> 00:46:07,000
Well, what should I have done?

339
00:46:08,541 --> 00:46:10,166
When I found out I was pregnant,

340
00:46:10,250 --> 00:46:13,041
I knew you were not good for me
or the child.

341
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:17,458
And I know you. You can't be trusted, Tom.

342
00:46:17,916 --> 00:46:20,416
As soon as there is a problem,
you're gone.

343
00:46:20,500 --> 00:46:23,416
Exactly. But with that kind of money,
I can leave for good.

344
00:46:23,500 --> 00:46:25,625
That's the plan? That's shit.

345
00:46:25,708 --> 00:46:26,833
Really?

346
00:46:27,500 --> 00:46:30,458
Shall I apply for something
with prison on my CV and work my way up?

347
00:46:31,041 --> 00:46:32,041
Forget it.

348
00:46:33,541 --> 00:46:37,208
But your father is a rich asshole who
doesn't even spend money on his daughter.

349
00:46:37,291 --> 00:46:39,250
Not even for her ransom.

350
00:46:39,833 --> 00:46:41,083
How will we get out of here?

351
00:46:45,291 --> 00:46:47,666
Tom, what about our child?

352
00:46:47,916 --> 00:46:50,666
Stop it. You don't even
believe it yourself.

353
00:46:50,750 --> 00:46:52,041
Okay, then take a look.

354
00:46:52,416 --> 00:46:54,958
Look at the doctor's appointments
on my cell phone.

355
00:47:20,041 --> 00:47:21,416
Forget it.

356
00:47:22,500 --> 00:47:24,875
If I put the battery in there,
the police can locate it.

357
00:47:25,458 --> 00:47:26,750
But obviously you know that, too.

358
00:47:28,541 --> 00:47:29,458
Tom!

359
00:47:35,333 --> 00:47:36,208
Stella!

360
00:47:39,208 --> 00:47:40,333
Stella.

361
00:47:45,125 --> 00:47:46,583
Wait a second.

362
00:48:01,791 --> 00:48:02,666
Stella?

363
00:48:04,458 --> 00:48:05,625
Stella, are you okay?

364
00:48:07,583 --> 00:48:09,041
Come on, sit up.

365
00:49:06,708 --> 00:49:09,583
No, please don't!

366
00:49:10,625 --> 00:49:12,583
Stella, please don't do that.
I'm sorry, okay?

367
00:49:14,541 --> 00:49:16,916
No. Stella! Please don't!

368
00:49:17,791 --> 00:49:18,875
Stella, stay here!

369
00:49:25,583 --> 00:49:28,000
Stella, come back!

370
00:49:34,750 --> 00:49:36,125
Help!

371
00:49:36,708 --> 00:49:38,208
Stella!

372
00:49:48,166 --> 00:49:49,041
Stella!

373
00:49:49,458 --> 00:49:50,291
Shit.

374
00:49:50,375 --> 00:49:51,333
Stella, stay here!

375
00:49:53,625 --> 00:49:54,916
No!

376
00:50:00,541 --> 00:50:02,375
Stella, you're killing both of us!

377
00:50:02,958 --> 00:50:03,791
<i>Berlin Police.</i>

378
00:50:03,875 --> 00:50:05,166
-Hello?
-Stella!

379
00:50:05,250 --> 00:50:07,583
I was kidnapped.
My name is Stella Mertens.

380
00:50:07,666 --> 00:50:08,541
Shit!

381
00:50:08,625 --> 00:50:09,708
I'm locked up.

382
00:50:11,166 --> 00:50:13,375
Can you locate the call?

383
00:50:14,083 --> 00:50:15,875
I don't know where I am.

384
00:50:15,958 --> 00:50:18,291
No, you have to come now! Right away.

385
00:50:18,375 --> 00:50:20,625
He'll come back soon. He'll kill me.

386
00:50:20,708 --> 00:50:23,666
No! There is no time.

387
00:50:27,833 --> 00:50:28,666
<i>Hello?</i>

388
00:50:28,750 --> 00:50:30,166
-Stella?
-<i>Can you hear me?</i>

389
00:50:30,250 --> 00:50:31,708
Okay. I think I can get to the key.

390
00:50:47,250 --> 00:50:48,958
Stella, I know I screwed up.

391
00:50:49,875 --> 00:50:50,916
Shut up.

392
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:53,625
I was just so angry.

393
00:50:57,833 --> 00:50:59,125
You are mad.

394
00:51:00,291 --> 00:51:03,375
You kidnap me
and want to cut off my finger?

395
00:51:05,333 --> 00:51:06,458
I don't know you.

396
00:51:15,791 --> 00:51:16,833
Lie down.

397
00:51:21,583 --> 00:51:22,416
Shit!

398
00:51:23,458 --> 00:51:24,291
Stella?

399
00:51:42,583 --> 00:51:43,666
Shit.

400
00:51:59,833 --> 00:52:01,208
Okay...

401
00:52:10,083 --> 00:52:11,541
Just do as we say.

402
00:52:12,708 --> 00:52:13,750
Then nothing will happen.

403
00:52:15,500 --> 00:52:16,708
Just stop lying.

404
00:52:56,583 --> 00:52:58,958
-I thought you weren't coming back.
-What?

405
00:52:59,750 --> 00:53:00,583
Nonsense.

406
00:53:14,625 --> 00:53:15,458
Everything okay?

407
00:53:16,916 --> 00:53:18,666
She puked with the gag in her mouth.

408
00:53:20,416 --> 00:53:21,541
Probably because of the food.

409
00:53:22,958 --> 00:53:24,333
But I realized early enough.

410
00:53:26,500 --> 00:53:27,416
She's sleeping now.

411
00:53:29,291 --> 00:53:30,125
Okay.

412
00:53:31,166 --> 00:53:33,791
Did you talk to the father?
Did he get the video?

413
00:53:38,833 --> 00:53:39,958
Tell me.

414
00:53:45,666 --> 00:53:46,750
Vic.

415
00:53:48,041 --> 00:53:48,958
The time has come.

416
00:53:50,916 --> 00:53:52,208
He has the money?

417
00:53:52,291 --> 00:53:53,541
All we need are the coordinates.

418
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:56,875
Shit.

419
00:53:58,333 --> 00:53:59,750
We need to get her to the boathouse.

420
00:54:03,250 --> 00:54:04,083
When will it start?

421
00:54:05,250 --> 00:54:06,083
Now.

422
00:54:07,500 --> 00:54:08,333
Now?

423
00:54:08,416 --> 00:54:10,791
Now. The father will pay.

424
00:54:13,333 --> 00:54:14,166
Okay.

425
00:54:17,791 --> 00:54:18,625
Great.

426
00:54:20,500 --> 00:54:21,333
Yes.

427
00:54:23,291 --> 00:54:24,125
Yes, great.

428
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,500
I was really nervous.
I didn't expect that.

429
00:54:34,250 --> 00:54:36,500
But we pulled it off together. Straight.

430
00:54:41,166 --> 00:54:42,625
And tomorrow we'll have four million.

431
00:54:43,791 --> 00:54:46,916
We'll never see each other again. A pity
almost. But can you imagine four million?

432
00:54:49,333 --> 00:54:50,166
Not really.

433
00:55:01,916 --> 00:55:03,000
I'm going to go to Mexico.

434
00:55:05,083 --> 00:55:05,958
With the money.

435
00:55:07,666 --> 00:55:09,916
I know someone there. An old friend.

436
00:55:12,583 --> 00:55:16,208
He showed me a picture once.
He lives right on the Pacific Ocean.

437
00:55:18,166 --> 00:55:19,291
It's always sunny there.

438
00:55:23,125 --> 00:55:24,041
Sounds good.

439
00:55:30,375 --> 00:55:31,416
If you want to...

440
00:55:33,125 --> 00:55:34,041
Think about it.

441
00:55:42,291 --> 00:55:43,375
Let's end this.

442
00:56:21,416 --> 00:56:24,291
PREGNANCY RECORD

443
00:56:29,041 --> 00:56:32,166
SURNAME: MERTENS
FIRST NAME: STELLA

444
00:56:39,541 --> 00:56:40,375
It's starting.

445
00:57:09,708 --> 00:57:10,791
Where did you get this?

446
00:57:15,125 --> 00:57:16,375
Where did you get this? Tell me.

447
00:57:19,291 --> 00:57:20,458
I don't know.

448
00:57:24,625 --> 00:57:25,458
The police.

449
00:57:26,750 --> 00:57:29,875
You called the police.
Will the fucking police come?

450
00:57:30,708 --> 00:57:31,958
You called the fucking police.

451
00:57:32,750 --> 00:57:34,500
-No.
-Tell me the truth.

452
00:57:34,583 --> 00:57:35,416
No.

453
00:57:35,500 --> 00:57:36,958
Tell me the truth.

454
00:57:37,041 --> 00:57:38,791
No! How? I'm tied up.

455
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:47,500
Why would he give you the cell phone?

456
00:57:48,250 --> 00:57:49,291
I don't know.

457
00:57:49,833 --> 00:57:50,875
Tell me.

458
00:57:51,791 --> 00:57:52,791
Tell me the truth.

459
00:57:56,500 --> 00:57:59,000
-Why would he give you the cell phone?
-I don't know.

460
00:58:01,166 --> 00:58:02,083
Tom!

461
00:58:04,833 --> 00:58:06,208
How do you know his name?

462
00:58:18,750 --> 00:58:22,541
EXIT

463
00:58:23,250 --> 00:58:25,166
<i>-You know each other.</i>
<i>-No.</i>

464
00:58:25,250 --> 00:58:29,083
No, he only told me his name
to calm me down.

465
00:58:29,166 --> 00:58:30,375
He gave you the cell.

466
00:58:30,458 --> 00:58:31,375
No.

467
00:58:31,458 --> 00:58:34,041
I didn't give it to you
and you're tied up.

468
00:58:37,375 --> 00:58:38,250
Please.

469
00:58:38,333 --> 00:58:40,041
Shut up. I need to think.

470
00:59:06,750 --> 00:59:07,791
What happened here?

471
00:59:15,666 --> 00:59:16,583
How did this get here?

472
00:59:19,208 --> 00:59:20,708
How did the bullet end up in the wall?

473
00:59:26,208 --> 00:59:27,166
Who shot here?

474
00:59:33,875 --> 00:59:35,708
Tell me who shot here or I'll kill you.

475
00:59:42,041 --> 00:59:44,708
I did. I shot.

476
00:59:46,500 --> 00:59:48,583
I had to go to the bathroom
and he uncuffed me.

477
00:59:48,666 --> 00:59:52,083
We had a fight and I managed
to take the gun away from him.

478
00:59:53,583 --> 00:59:55,041
So why are you still here then?

479
00:59:55,958 --> 00:59:59,875
Because he overpowered me
and cuffed me to the bed again.

480
01:00:06,375 --> 01:00:08,375
He is my ex-boyfriend.

481
01:00:13,541 --> 01:00:15,291
He didn't tell you, right?

482
01:00:37,875 --> 01:00:39,000
Do you know my name?

483
01:00:41,791 --> 01:00:42,625
No.

484
01:00:43,375 --> 01:00:44,208
No.

485
01:00:45,416 --> 01:00:46,250
What's my name?

486
01:00:46,916 --> 01:00:48,208
I don't know.

487
01:00:48,875 --> 01:00:50,000
He told you.

488
01:00:51,083 --> 01:00:52,583
He didn't tell me your name.

489
01:00:52,666 --> 01:00:53,833
-Yes, he did.
-No.

490
01:00:54,166 --> 01:00:55,125
Say my name.

491
01:00:57,333 --> 01:00:59,375
Say my name.

492
01:01:26,833 --> 01:01:27,750
You're out of breath.

493
01:01:29,125 --> 01:01:30,375
I ran up the stairs.

494
01:01:32,916 --> 01:01:34,333
Shall we check her gag again?

495
01:01:36,791 --> 01:01:37,625
I just did.

496
01:01:39,083 --> 01:01:39,916
You did?

497
01:01:43,041 --> 01:01:43,875
Is she okay?

498
01:01:47,041 --> 01:01:48,000
What are you doing?

499
01:01:51,666 --> 01:01:52,791
Checking.

500
01:01:54,583 --> 01:01:55,500
What?

501
01:01:56,833 --> 01:01:59,000
We want it to work when we need it, right?

502
01:02:05,875 --> 01:02:07,291
Tom, explain something to me...

503
01:02:09,750 --> 01:02:10,875
Why did you pick her?

504
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:15,500
I didn't pick her. You did.

505
01:02:15,583 --> 01:02:17,750
But you suggested her. Why?

506
01:02:18,166 --> 01:02:19,166
You know exactly why.

507
01:02:20,750 --> 01:02:22,208
I saw the newspaper article.

508
01:02:23,500 --> 01:02:24,625
You saw it as well.

509
01:02:25,291 --> 01:02:26,250
What is this about?

510
01:02:27,333 --> 01:02:28,500
Something is not right.

511
01:02:30,791 --> 01:02:31,666
What do you mean?

512
01:02:35,458 --> 01:02:38,750
Well, she was acting weird.

513
01:02:41,125 --> 01:02:42,041
What did she say?

514
01:02:42,416 --> 01:02:43,250
Say?

515
01:02:44,166 --> 01:02:45,791
Why should she have said anything?

516
01:02:48,208 --> 01:02:49,625
You just said she was weird.

517
01:02:49,708 --> 01:02:51,541
But I didn't say that she said something.

518
01:02:52,708 --> 01:02:53,833
What would she say?

519
01:02:56,250 --> 01:02:57,166
Probably nothing.

520
01:03:04,416 --> 01:03:05,250
Come here.

521
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:12,833
Tom, come here.

522
01:03:25,583 --> 01:03:27,291
Tell me that we're honest with each other.

523
01:03:35,458 --> 01:03:37,166
Tell me that we're honest with each other.

524
01:03:41,916 --> 01:03:43,250
We're honest with each other.

525
01:03:51,958 --> 01:03:53,041
Okay.

526
01:03:58,416 --> 01:03:59,583
Get the anesthetic.

527
01:05:26,166 --> 01:05:27,666
Are you checking the coordinates again?

528
01:05:29,291 --> 01:05:30,125
Yeah.

529
01:05:30,958 --> 01:05:31,875
Let's go.

530
01:07:32,041 --> 01:07:33,000
Give me your keys.

531
01:07:34,916 --> 01:07:36,250
Why? You have your own.

532
01:07:36,333 --> 01:07:37,500
You don't need them anymore.

533
01:07:39,041 --> 01:07:39,958
Is that a problem?

534
01:07:44,916 --> 01:07:45,875
No, no problem.

535
01:07:46,708 --> 01:07:47,625
Fine.

536
01:07:51,291 --> 01:07:52,500
Let's go.

537
01:07:53,750 --> 01:07:54,583
Where?

538
01:07:54,666 --> 01:07:55,625
To get the money.

539
01:07:57,291 --> 01:07:59,000
The plan was that I stay here.

540
01:07:59,083 --> 01:08:01,166
I need you at the handoff
in case of any surprises.

541
01:08:01,541 --> 01:08:02,708
What kind of surprises?

542
01:08:04,166 --> 01:08:06,041
Tom, if I knew,
they wouldn't be surprises.

543
01:08:07,166 --> 01:08:08,708
-But...
-What?

544
01:08:09,250 --> 01:08:11,416
What if something happens to us
and we don't come back?

545
01:08:11,958 --> 01:08:12,916
We will come back.

546
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:14,875
But what if we won't? She'd die here.

547
01:08:16,041 --> 01:08:18,166
If we don't make it,
who cares what happens to her?

548
01:08:20,666 --> 01:08:22,000
It's better if we kill her anyway.

549
01:08:22,750 --> 01:08:25,416
Because if not, she will always
be able to identify our voices.

550
01:08:25,500 --> 01:08:29,000
If she's dead, she can't. Right?

551
01:08:31,375 --> 01:08:32,416
Right.

552
01:08:34,291 --> 01:08:35,125
Let's go.

553
01:09:52,750 --> 01:09:53,583
Wait.

554
01:09:54,875 --> 01:09:55,958
What?

555
01:09:56,500 --> 01:09:57,333
My shoe.

556
01:10:10,041 --> 01:10:10,875
Okay.

557
01:10:45,958 --> 01:10:47,000
Is the money already there?

558
01:10:49,208 --> 01:10:50,125
It is.

559
01:10:51,916 --> 01:10:53,041
Go get it.

560
01:10:53,750 --> 01:10:54,583
Me?

561
01:10:55,708 --> 01:10:57,666
-What if they're waiting for us?
-They're not.

562
01:10:58,166 --> 01:10:59,208
-But...
-Go.

563
01:11:00,250 --> 01:11:01,208
Get the money.

564
01:11:51,750 --> 01:11:52,583
Vic!

565
01:11:54,625 --> 01:11:56,916
Vic, the money isn't here.

566
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:00,000
They screwed us over.

567
01:12:03,250 --> 01:12:04,083
Shit.

568
01:12:07,500 --> 01:12:08,583
They didn't screw us over.

569
01:12:10,125 --> 01:12:11,625
But why is the money not here then?

570
01:12:12,291 --> 01:12:13,625
I sent them different coordinates.

571
01:12:20,291 --> 01:12:21,125
Vic, wait!

572
01:12:22,708 --> 01:12:23,708
What did she tell you?

573
01:12:25,333 --> 01:12:26,166
Please...

574
01:12:27,708 --> 01:12:28,541
I'm sorry.

575
01:12:28,625 --> 01:12:30,458
No, I'm sorry.

576
01:12:33,500 --> 01:12:34,583
Please don't do this.

577
01:12:38,458 --> 01:12:39,625
She's pregnant with my baby.

578
01:12:42,166 --> 01:12:43,208
What did you say about me?

579
01:12:45,083 --> 01:12:46,333
Did you tell her my name?

580
01:12:48,250 --> 01:12:51,500
Only your first name
and that we know each other from prison.

581
01:12:54,583 --> 01:12:56,916
I asked you whether we're honest
with each other.

582
01:12:58,625 --> 01:12:59,625
You don't have to do this.

583
01:13:00,291 --> 01:13:03,833
We'll go ahead as planned. We'll pick up
the money and you'll never see me again.

584
01:13:03,916 --> 01:13:06,916
Forget it. You screwed up.
This is the consequence.

585
01:13:07,375 --> 01:13:09,333
-Close your eyes.
-Wait, Vic!

586
01:13:09,416 --> 01:13:11,208
-Close your eyes.
-Wait!

587
01:13:13,083 --> 01:13:15,291
Do you remember
when we first met in prison?

588
01:13:16,541 --> 01:13:20,500
I was so scared and you protected me.
You helped me.

589
01:13:24,375 --> 01:13:25,625
I'll never forget that.

590
01:13:36,375 --> 01:13:37,375
Tom!

591
01:14:36,791 --> 01:14:37,625
Tom!

592
01:14:40,625 --> 01:14:41,666
Tom!

593
01:15:46,083 --> 01:15:46,916
Help!

594
01:15:52,291 --> 01:15:54,625
Help!

595
01:17:14,125 --> 01:17:15,166
Help!

596
01:17:15,625 --> 01:17:16,583
Help!

597
01:17:16,875 --> 01:17:18,875
Help me! Help!

598
01:17:20,875 --> 01:17:21,958
Let's end this.

599
01:17:32,666 --> 01:17:33,583
It's almost over.

600
01:17:35,750 --> 01:17:36,833
Everything will be over.

601
01:17:40,666 --> 01:17:42,291
The poison will stop your breathing.

602
01:17:48,625 --> 01:17:49,916
Then you'll die quickly.

603
01:17:52,291 --> 01:17:53,208
Stay calm.

604
01:17:55,125 --> 01:17:56,041
Stay calm.

605
01:17:56,583 --> 01:17:58,416
Stay calm.

606
01:18:00,125 --> 01:18:01,250
Calm down!

607
01:18:04,041 --> 01:18:07,208
It'll hurt for a brief moment
and then you won't feel anything anymore.

608
01:18:24,500 --> 01:18:25,583
What do you still want here?

609
01:18:28,458 --> 01:18:29,541
Her death is your fault.

610
01:18:31,583 --> 01:18:34,333
And her child's death, too.

611
01:18:37,375 --> 01:18:38,375
No!

612
01:18:43,833 --> 01:18:45,166
I don't understand you, Tom.

613
01:18:47,458 --> 01:18:49,125
I thought we'd do this together.

614
01:18:50,250 --> 01:18:51,375
I trusted you.

615
01:18:52,250 --> 01:18:53,375
I liked you.

616
01:18:55,458 --> 01:18:56,958
But you ruined everything.

617
01:18:59,666 --> 01:19:00,500
Vic...

618
01:19:03,541 --> 01:19:04,750
I have something to tell you.

619
01:19:05,333 --> 01:19:06,625
I don't care anymore.

620
01:19:06,708 --> 01:19:07,541
Yes, you do.

621
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:11,000
Screw you.

622
01:19:32,875 --> 01:19:33,875
Tom!

623
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:35,958
Tom!

624
01:19:37,208 --> 01:19:38,416
Tom!

625
01:19:42,875 --> 01:19:45,291
Tom! The keys, Tom.

626
01:19:46,833 --> 01:19:48,291
Tom.

627
01:19:52,458 --> 01:19:53,833
The keys, Tom!

628
01:20:14,125 --> 01:20:15,708
Yes.

629
01:20:18,708 --> 01:20:20,166
Hey!

630
01:20:24,041 --> 01:20:24,875
Tom!

631
01:20:41,500 --> 01:20:42,333
Yes.

632
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:45,833
Tom!
