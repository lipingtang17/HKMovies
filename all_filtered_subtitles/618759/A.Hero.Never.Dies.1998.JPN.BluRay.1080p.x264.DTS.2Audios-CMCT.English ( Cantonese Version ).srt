A Hero Never Dies (1998)
English subtitle - Cantonese version

2
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
( Jack / Martin )

3
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,500
Slowly.

4
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,300
Water.

5
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:31,700
Mr. Fortune Teller,

6
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:34,500
since Mr. Fong wanted to
occupy all of our possession last year,

7
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,800
both of our gangs have been
fighting all the time,

8
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:38,700
and this war hasn't been stopped once.

9
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:40,900
A lot of my people were killed,

10
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I feel really bad about it.

11
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,500
I told you very clearly last year.

12
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:51,650
Regardless how people has died,

13
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:54,750
don't let the fighting
go on until after July.

14
00:03:55,050 --> 00:03:58,950
Now I can't do anything
to help you.

15
00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:01,650
Mr. Fortune Teller,
I've already tried my best.

16
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:05,800
It's not possible.

17
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:07,900
With that many casualties,

18
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,300
you still haven't
destroyed Mr. Fong.

19
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:14,400
It's because you guys
are afraid to die!

20
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:16,900
If you want to be
the most powerful one,

21
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,500
you need to have
the strongest army.

22
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Be able to get back
all that you've lost.

23
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:26,550
You'll lose this battle.

24
00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:28,550
Your men will betray you,

25
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:30,000
and you'll die painfully.

26
00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:32,050
This is gonna be your destiny.

27
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:33,200
Mr. Fortune Teller,

28
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:35,800
please save me.

29
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:43,500
Then you must follow my guidance.

30
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,600
Of course, of course.

31
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,800
How can you treat
Mr. Fortune Teller this way?!

32
00:04:54,850 --> 00:04:56,300
How dare you!

33
00:04:56,350 --> 00:04:58,250
Tell him to drop his gun!

34
00:04:58,350 --> 00:05:00,150
Jack,
what the hell are you doing?!

35
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:26,550
Mr. Fortune Teller,

36
00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:28,350
your mind can
read through the future,

37
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,600
you can calculate everything
that hasn't yet happened.

38
00:05:29,650 --> 00:05:31,200
Can you tell whether
you'll be shot today?

39
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:32,950
Jack,
are you out of your mind?!

40
00:05:33,050 --> 00:05:34,950
You dare to shot me?

41
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:36,850
Can't you?

42
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:42,850
Can't you?

43
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:45,100
No!

44
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:47,100
Mister.

45
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:49,400
Jack, how dare you!

46
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:50,900
Mr. Yam,

47
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,900
nobody in our gang
is afraid to die.

48
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,150
If you want to win,

49
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:56,250
we all will sacrifice our lives
for your victory.

50
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:58,750
Why do you want your life
to be decided by someone else?

51
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:00,900
God is the one that carries a gun.

52
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:03,100
Am I right,
Mr. Fortune Teller?

53
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,000
Mr. Yam's hand is bleeding.

54
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,200
Jack,

55
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:53,000
how many of our brothers do you think
can go back to Hong Kong this time?

56
00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:55,250
You don't need to ask God for the answer.

57
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:58,250
As long as you know who your enemy is,
you'll know the result.

58
00:07:22,450 --> 00:07:23,950
Jack, the line is busy.

59
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,500
Keep dialing.

60
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,300
Jack, it's getting through.

61
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:43,000
Michael, turn back.

62
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Mr. Yam,

63
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:48,100
Jack told us to turn back.

64
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:49,750
Ignore him.

65
00:07:51,850 --> 00:07:54,050
Are we supposed to wait and die here?

66
00:07:59,650 --> 00:08:01,050
Drive faster.

67
00:08:13,850 --> 00:08:14,950
Back off!

68
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:28,300
Stop him,
don't let him get away.

69
00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:41,150
Mr. Yam, get off the car now!

70
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,000
Run them over!

71
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:17,100
Michael,

72
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:18,850
take Mr. Yam to the dock.

73
00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:20,150
Mr. Yam,

74
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:21,750
get inside the car!

75
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:41,800
Get in here! Joe!

76
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:49,450
Joe!

77
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:22,600
Wong.

78
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:24,000
Martin.

79
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:26,300
Leave Jack a message for me.

80
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:28,600
Tell him I'm gonna tear down
his mother fucking ancestor's home.

81
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:30,800
If you miss one word,
I'm gonna kill you.

82
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:44,150
Martin said he was gonna...

83
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:45,750
Te...

84
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:49,450
Tear down your
mother fucking ancestor's home.

85
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:51,150
Tell Martin to stick his shit face
into his asshole.

86
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,700
If you miss one word,
I'm gonna kill you.

87
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,250
I'm gonna crack
his mother's ass with a bat.

88
00:13:54,350 --> 00:13:55,800
You tell him to suck my dick.

89
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:57,650
He dared to come up here
but not dared to kill me,

90
00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:58,400
tell him to go to hell,

91
00:13:58,450 --> 00:13:59,450
suck my dick!

92
00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:00,750
Aiming for that long
but still didn't shoot,

93
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,200
too chicken shit that
he knew he was gonna miss?

94
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:03,800
Please don't put me on the spot.

95
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:05,650
I...
I am old,

96
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:07,300
and my memory is not so good.

97
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:08,750
You...

98
00:14:08,850 --> 00:14:10,650
you guys should get together,

99
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:12,950
and clear things out yourselves.

100
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:55,700
Martin.

101
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:59,800
Yo-yo-yo, hey!

102
00:16:02,050 --> 00:16:03,550
Come on, come on, come on.

103
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:06,100
Come on.

104
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:09,250
Yeah.

105
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:14,750

- Fiona.
- How are you, Po?

139
00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:24,150
Yo Yo.

140
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:36,700
Did you really
have to take this one?

141
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:38,900
This is for our guest.

142
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:44,800
My wine...

143
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:48,300
Is the very best.

144
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,600
Fair enough.

145
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:52,300
Compare yours to mine...

146
00:20:52,850 --> 00:20:54,300
There's a big difference.

147
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,400
Mine is the best.

148
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:01,850
- Po.
- Yes.

149
00:21:01,950 --> 00:21:03,100
You know something about wine,
right?

150
00:21:03,150 --> 00:21:04,350
Just a little.

151
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,050
Which one is good?

152
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,500
Both are good.

153
00:21:07,550 --> 00:21:09,350
Which one is better?

154
00:21:09,450 --> 00:21:11,150
Both are equally good.

155
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:15,700
Pick up his bottle
with your left hand.

156
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:18,700
Grab mine with your right hand.

157
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:20,450
Get back one step.

158
00:21:20,650 --> 00:21:22,350
Straighten both arms.

159
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:24,550
Straighten both arms!

160
00:21:27,150 --> 00:21:28,950
Drop one of them onto the floor.

161
00:21:29,650 --> 00:21:30,950
Are you gonna beat me?

162
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,500
I'll kill you!

163
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:42,200
Jack has saved his for a long time.

164
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:46,050
Po, why don't you try this?

165
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:47,550
Store this bottle first,

166
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:48,950
we'll come back for this
in a couple of days.

167
00:21:49,050 --> 00:21:50,600
We'll drink this tonight.

168
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:51,700
Put a tag on,

169
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:54,350
write the names of Jack
and Martin on it.

170
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,500
So, here you go.

171
00:21:57,700 --> 00:21:59,200
Thank you, Fiona.

172
00:23:16,050 --> 00:23:17,250
Won't you get going?

173
00:23:19,850 --> 00:23:21,850
You've been with Martin
for a long time?

174
00:23:22,450 --> 00:23:24,450
Before I was even eighteen.

175
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:26,700
It doesn't seem like you've
been with Jack for very long.

176
00:23:26,950 --> 00:23:28,750
It's been almost a year.

177
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:31,300
But till now I still don't know
how I'm supposed to be his woman.

178
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:33,100
Can you teach me?

179
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:37,500
Wear high heels.

180
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:39,600
As a top man's wife,
you have to at least look powerful,

181
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:41,400
your voice always comes first
even before you arrive.

182
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:45,850
So when your man is screwing around
he'll hear your voice in advance.

183
00:23:45,950 --> 00:23:49,550
So it'll give him more time
to think of an excuse to lie to you.

184
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:52,600
Understand?

185
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:57,550
Can't we find sometime to
get together just to chat?

186
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
It's not possible for us to be friend,
you know?

187
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:05,100
Either Jack or Martin will die
on the other's hand.

188
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:09,400
They seem like friends.

189
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:11,700
This is where they stand,
can't help it.

190
00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:13,150
Men are like that,

191
00:24:13,250 --> 00:24:15,750
they treat their brothers
better than their women.

192
00:24:15,850 --> 00:24:17,850
I knew this since day one.

193
00:24:34,650 --> 00:24:36,450
Where's Mr. Yam?

194
00:24:36,550 --> 00:24:38,050
Mr. Yam is in Bangkok.

195
00:24:38,150 --> 00:24:40,250
I told you to take him
over to the general.

196
00:24:40,450 --> 00:24:42,100
He wanted to meet the Fortune Teller.

197
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:43,750
Didn't you hear me?

198
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:45,950
Are you the boss or Mr. Yam?

199
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:49,000
Stop the car.

200
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,800
Hung, airport.

201
00:25:01,850 --> 00:25:03,050
Yes, Jack.

202
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:15,750
Hi.

203
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:21,000
Martin,
Mr. Fong is waiting for you in there.

204
00:25:21,450 --> 00:25:23,950
How generous!
Three of them.

205
00:25:24,150 --> 00:25:26,150
Mr. Fong is afraid to get bore.

206
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:30,100
Hi, Miss.

207
00:25:31,150 --> 00:25:33,150
Is this real or what,
can I rub it off?

208
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:34,700
Try it.

209
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:35,900
So this is real.

210
00:25:35,950 --> 00:25:37,950
What are you laughing at,
you've got something to be rubbed?

211
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,500
Guess where that is?

212
00:25:59,550 --> 00:26:01,450
Martin, how have you been?

213
00:26:01,550 --> 00:26:04,050
I haven't been too well.

214
00:26:04,150 --> 00:26:06,000
I had to go around detours,

215
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:08,000
and make sure nobody was
following us before I get here.

216
00:26:08,050 --> 00:26:09,050
Mr. Fong.

217
00:26:10,350 --> 00:26:11,550
I've been waiting for you
for a long time,

218
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:13,100
how's out there?

219
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:14,750
It's a mess out there.

220
00:26:14,850 --> 00:26:16,650
When I tried to kill Yam last time,

221
00:26:16,750 --> 00:26:18,050
I failed.

222
00:26:18,150 --> 00:26:20,250
Three of our guys got killed.

223
00:26:20,450 --> 00:26:23,050
It adds up to eighteen already.

224
00:26:23,150 --> 00:26:24,150
So,

225
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:26,700
do you need me to take charge now?

226
00:26:27,450 --> 00:26:28,950
Probably not,

227
00:26:29,050 --> 00:26:31,050
you should be pretty safe in here.

228
00:26:31,450 --> 00:26:32,950
In addition,

229
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:34,600
Yam ran off.

230
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:36,000
Where did the asshole go?

231
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:37,750
Maybe to go see the general.

232
00:26:37,850 --> 00:26:38,850
Fuck!

233
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:41,400
Now he's crying for mama,
what a useless piece of shit.

234
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:42,700
This time I have to
straighten things out with him,

235
00:26:42,750 --> 00:26:44,600
I won't do general a favor anymore.

236
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:46,700
Then we all gonna die.

237
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:48,700
We made a deal last year,

238
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:50,400
we both were gonna co-operate
to control the entire Hong Kong.

239
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:53,500
That bastard kicked me out,
he even tried to kill me.

240
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:57,100
The battle went on until today,
whoever gives up first loses.

241
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:58,850
Martin,

242
00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:00,850
you had helped me for more than a decade,

243
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:02,950
regardless what you have to
help me this time.

244
00:27:03,050 --> 00:27:04,200
However,

245
00:27:04,250 --> 00:27:05,600
you have to kill that bastard to me.

246
00:27:05,650 --> 00:27:07,650
Before he finds the general.

247
00:27:08,650 --> 00:27:09,950
Of course.

248
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:13,300
Take a rest.

249
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:15,950
Martin, good luck.

250
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:17,600
Go have a haircut.

251
00:27:23,150 --> 00:27:24,150
Boss,

252
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:26,200
- do you want me to
find you a several girls?
- No.

253
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:28,300
What was Martin thinking?
This is a country side.

254
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:29,600
Fuck!

255
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:31,550
Mr. Fortune Teller
doesn't usually meet visitor.

256
00:28:31,650 --> 00:28:33,150
You're very honored today,

257
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:34,700
what do you want to ask?

258
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:39,000
Here.

259
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:43,000
I've heard something about a person...

260
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:45,000
whom I'm looking for.

261
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:49,800
So I came over to
find out what happened.

262
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:52,800
But...

263
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:56,300
Now, it doesn't matter anymore.

264
00:29:00,850 --> 00:29:03,350
Mr. Fortune Teller gives you advice...

265
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:05,450
just because you're Mr. Fong's guy.

266
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:07,500
What do you do this for?!

267
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:10,300
Thank you.

268
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:13,900
Mr. Fortune Teller,
if you can read through the future that well.

269
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,850
Then you should check it out,
if you're gonna get shot today?

270
00:29:19,450 --> 00:29:20,950
Yes or no?

271
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:22,200
Yes!

272
00:29:22,250 --> 00:29:23,250
You got it.

273
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:26,700
I curse that
you will die so painfully!

274
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:29,000
Your body will be dumped on the street,

275
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:31,300
you won't even have your own grave!

276
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:59,500
This place is really for
swimming and meeting girls.

277
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:00,900
We should be having a holiday in here.

278
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:02,300
Martin,

279
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:04,800
who do you think will win this time?

280
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:08,200
Why didn't you ask that Fortune Teller
when you just had a chance 5 minutes ago.

281
00:30:11,750 --> 00:30:13,900
You only need to know who your opponent is,

282
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:16,300
then you'll know the result.

283
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:57,500
Mr. Yam,

284
00:30:57,550 --> 00:30:59,250
we can't go any further on this road,
it's very dangerous.

285
00:30:59,350 --> 00:31:00,650
There's a motel in the front,

286
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:02,300
let's stay there for tonight.

287
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:51,600
Don't move!

288
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:14,300
You guys must be tired by now.

289
00:32:14,750 --> 00:32:16,450
Thanks for your hard work.

290
00:32:16,750 --> 00:32:19,550
Jack is smart and loyal,

291
00:32:19,750 --> 00:32:21,750
he had saved me a several times.

292
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:24,600
But I can feel that things are
a little chaotic this time,

293
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:26,600
do you think Jack is scared?

294
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:28,600
What hasn't Jack been through before?

295
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:30,600
Things are gonna be okay.

296
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:33,250
Then you guys are lucky to
have him as a big brother,
no worries, right?

297
00:32:33,350 --> 00:32:34,550
Of course.

298
00:32:34,650 --> 00:32:36,150
Need I say more?

299
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:46,800
Have a good rest first.

300
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:36,900
I'll take it as long as
they're cooked alright,

301
00:34:36,950 --> 00:34:38,950
- but don't make them taste too awful.
- Okay, Jack.

302
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:43,400
You must find out whether
it's gonna rain tomorrow.

303
00:34:43,450 --> 00:34:44,650
Okay.

304
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:58,100
Have a cup of tea first.

305
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:13,800
I went to see the doctor last month,

306
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:16,600
he told me to quit smoking.

307
00:35:17,750 --> 00:35:19,350
I'm getting old,

308
00:35:19,550 --> 00:35:21,550
can't bear with this any longer.

309
00:35:21,950 --> 00:35:24,450
I shouldn't go see
the Fortune Teller.

310
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:28,000
Ask those imaginative spirits
instead of real people,

311
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:30,500
can't decide anything on my own.

312
00:35:31,950 --> 00:35:33,450
I think it's about time...

313
00:35:33,550 --> 00:35:35,250
I have asked you a several times,

314
00:35:35,350 --> 00:35:37,500
were you gonna wage a war with Fong?

315
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:39,100
You said yes,

316
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:41,500
you were gonna fight him,
till the very end,
there's no turning back.

317
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:43,700
Our gang's spirit is very important now,

318
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:45,800
you shouldn't say things like that.

319
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:47,800
I've heard that you've seen Martin?

320
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:49,650
He has arrived in Thailand...

321
00:35:49,750 --> 00:35:51,750
and went to see the Fortune Teller.

322
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:54,700
So,

323
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:55,900
are we just gonna sit here
and wait for him?

324
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,550
It's better to fight
against people than God.

325
00:35:57,650 --> 00:35:58,900
It's very late now
and it's pouring outside,

326
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,200
if we go up the hill,
all of us will be taking a very high risk.

327
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:01,800
I want a gun.

328
00:36:23,950 --> 00:36:25,150
You can kick me out after tonight,

329
00:36:25,250 --> 00:36:26,750
but it's the best for you
to trust me now.

330
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:14,000
I can't find my gun!

331
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:18,900
Don't get out!

332
00:37:39,950 --> 00:37:41,150
Stay!

333
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:45,200
Close your eyes.

334
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:20,000
General.

335
00:45:16,100 --> 00:45:20,300
You guy's been fighting for a year.

336
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:24,100
A lot of people got killed.

337
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:28,650
But you let it carry on.

338
00:45:28,850 --> 00:45:33,650
Now I'm here to be the witness.

339
00:45:34,100 --> 00:45:37,600
All of your possession will...

340
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:42,300
remain the same as a year ago.

341
00:46:37,850 --> 00:46:39,650
You can't enter this area,

342
00:46:39,750 --> 00:46:41,550
please leave. Go!

343
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:47,350
I know now how to be your woman.

344
00:46:47,850 --> 00:46:49,650
Please wake up.

345
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:04,850
I didn't even to see Hung's face
for the last time,

346
00:50:04,950 --> 00:50:06,450
how could you cremate him
just like this.

347
00:50:06,550 --> 00:50:08,550
Give me back his ashes!

348
00:50:08,700 --> 00:50:10,700
Mr. Yam doesn't want you all
to worry about anything.

349
00:50:11,150 --> 00:50:12,650
That is my husband!

350
00:50:12,750 --> 00:50:13,750
I don't care!

351
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:15,600
I have to see Mr. Yam.

352
00:50:15,750 --> 00:50:16,750
Where's Jack?

353
00:50:16,850 --> 00:50:17,950
Why isn't he here?

354
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:19,300
Doesn't he want to see us?

355
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:20,900
Go find Jack for me.

356
00:50:24,450 --> 00:50:27,050
Mr. Yam doesn't want anyone to mention
anything about it from now on.

357
00:50:29,750 --> 00:50:31,950
Here's some money for the kids.

358
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:37,800
You too hope the children
can grow up fast.

359
00:50:52,950 --> 00:50:54,250
I'm sorry,

360
00:50:54,350 --> 00:50:56,350
there is nothing we can do.

361
00:50:56,900 --> 00:51:00,100
If we don't amputate the infection may spread,

362
00:51:00,600 --> 00:51:02,950
this could cost him his life.

363
00:51:03,350 --> 00:51:05,350
Then amputate them.

364
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:39,000
( Gang leaders make peace and rule Hong Kong together )

365
00:51:51,850 --> 00:51:53,350
I want the one up there.

366
00:51:53,450 --> 00:51:55,250
The one up there?
Sure.

367
00:51:55,550 --> 00:51:57,550
- Is it aspirin?
- Yes.

368
00:53:13,500 --> 00:53:15,500
You pissed your pants again?

369
00:53:16,500 --> 00:53:18,000
I'm a cripple.

370
00:55:49,450 --> 00:55:51,250
I've made arrangement
with the ship company,

371
00:55:51,350 --> 00:55:52,850
that bastard...

372
00:56:00,050 --> 00:56:02,050
They can smuggle us
back to Hong Kong.

373
00:56:34,100 --> 00:56:35,600
Why did you hand up on me?!

374
00:56:35,700 --> 00:56:37,450
Why did you hand up on me?!

375
00:56:37,900 --> 00:56:39,450
Martin and I are at the dock,

376
00:56:39,500 --> 00:56:41,200
send someone over to pick us up!

377
00:57:35,050 --> 00:57:36,850
People always win!

378
00:57:36,950 --> 00:57:39,750
Yeah! Mr. Fong is the greatest!

379
00:57:43,250 --> 00:57:45,450
Mr. Fong, you can stop
even the biggest rain storm.

380
00:57:45,550 --> 00:57:47,250
The whole world should belong to you.

381
00:57:47,350 --> 00:57:48,600
Mr. Fong,
you're the greatest.

382
00:57:48,700 --> 00:57:50,200
When are you gonna
open the third nightclub?

383
00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:51,800
That depends on my mood.

384
00:57:52,300 --> 00:57:54,100
Mr. Fong and Mr. Yam are now partners,
who else can be more powerful.

385
00:57:54,200 --> 00:57:55,500
There's only you two in the world.

386
00:57:55,600 --> 00:57:57,200
Then you should come more often.

387
00:57:57,300 --> 00:57:58,600
Thanks a lot.

388
00:57:58,700 --> 00:58:00,200
- Of course.
- Cheers.

389
00:58:15,100 --> 00:58:16,800
Chris, Martin's back.

390
00:58:21,600 --> 00:58:22,600
Chris.

391
00:58:22,700 --> 00:58:23,700
Fiona.

392
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:25,000
We need to see Fong.

393
00:58:25,100 --> 00:58:26,600
I think it's not a good time now.

394
00:58:26,700 --> 00:58:28,700
Can't you see Martin's here?

395
00:59:02,100 --> 00:59:03,900
Craig, can you hear?

396
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:07,800
Craig, can you hear?

397
00:59:09,500 --> 00:59:10,500
I'm Bob,

398
00:59:10,550 --> 00:59:12,250
can anyone pick up?

399
00:59:12,800 --> 00:59:13,900
Martin's back.

400
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:15,300
He's coming up.

401
00:59:24,800 --> 00:59:25,850
Boss.

402
00:59:25,950 --> 00:59:26,950
Boss.

403
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:30,000
Boss,

404
00:59:30,100 --> 00:59:31,900
Martin is downstairs.

405
00:59:36,100 --> 00:59:37,900
What the fuck did you say?

406
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:41,000
How can he be back?

407
00:59:42,350 --> 00:59:43,550
Boss, what's the matter?

408
00:59:43,650 --> 00:59:44,650
You...

409
00:59:45,550 --> 00:59:47,550
Get over here!

410
00:59:48,050 --> 00:59:50,050
How can he come back?

411
00:59:50,150 --> 00:59:51,150
Come here!

412
00:59:52,100 --> 00:59:54,300
Dare you to move out...

413
00:59:59,550 --> 01:00:01,550
Boss, what's wrong?

414
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:05,200
You go and take care of it.

415
01:00:06,500 --> 01:00:08,000
Go downstairs first!

416
01:00:08,200 --> 01:00:10,100
It's okay,
all go downstairs.

417
01:00:10,200 --> 01:00:11,200
Come on, come on.

418
01:00:11,300 --> 01:00:12,800
Drink again,
drink again, come!

419
01:00:36,800 --> 01:00:38,600
- I have to see Fong!
- Fong gives you and Martin some money.

420
01:00:38,700 --> 01:00:40,700
- What the fuck? You thought I came to beg?!
- He'll contact you later.

421
01:00:40,900 --> 01:00:43,100
Craig, you dare to lift Martin up?!

422
01:00:46,650 --> 01:00:47,650
See that?!

423
01:00:47,750 --> 01:00:49,750
This is all because of
your asshole boss.

424
01:00:50,300 --> 01:00:52,300
You mother fucker!
Get over here to see me!

425
01:00:53,200 --> 01:00:55,400
This is how it ends up
to be your brother.

426
01:00:55,500 --> 01:00:58,800
Have you ever take a look at them,
concern about them for once?

427
01:00:58,900 --> 01:01:00,900
When we both were stuck in Thailand with absolutely nothing,

428
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:04,300
we called you for help,
you dared to hang up on me!

429
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:06,800
We were there for you ever since we were kids,
now this is how you're treating us!

430
01:01:06,850 --> 01:01:08,050
What kind of person are you?

431
01:01:08,150 --> 01:01:09,750
Craig,
do I have to get down there
and fix it myself?!

432
01:01:09,800 --> 01:01:11,100
Boss, I'm taking care of it.

433
01:01:11,200 --> 01:01:13,100
- I'm sorry, Fiona.
Grab her.
- Let go!

434
01:01:13,200 --> 01:01:15,200
Craig, who makes you become,
who you are today,

435
01:01:15,300 --> 01:01:16,800
who has been helping you all these years.

436
01:01:16,900 --> 01:01:18,950
Come out! You bastard!

437
01:01:19,050 --> 01:01:20,850
What a piece of shit!

438
01:01:20,900 --> 01:01:22,100
- You coward!
- Louder!

439
01:01:22,150 --> 01:01:23,450
You don't even dare to
take a look at your brother.

440
01:01:23,500 --> 01:01:25,000
What kind of boss are you?

441
01:01:25,050 --> 01:01:26,450
Fuck you!

442
01:01:36,650 --> 01:01:39,650
Come out! Come out!

443
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:44,500
Go to hell!

444
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:46,500
Let's go!

445
01:01:48,200 --> 01:01:49,500
You traitor!

446
01:02:18,400 --> 01:02:20,400
Thank you all for your shares
and partnership.

447
01:02:20,500 --> 01:02:22,400
This business is surely profitable.

448
01:02:22,500 --> 01:02:24,300
The most important thing is that we all
will have good business relationship.

449
01:02:24,400 --> 01:02:26,900
We will make a lot of money.

450
01:02:30,300 --> 01:02:31,900
I don't have much to say,

451
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:33,900
opportunity is for everybody.

452
01:02:38,050 --> 01:02:39,850
Fong, you loyaless son of a bitch!

453
01:02:39,950 --> 01:02:42,200
Without Martin's help,
you'd still be parking people's cars.

454
01:02:42,250 --> 01:02:43,450
You wouldn't be here today!

455
01:02:43,500 --> 01:02:45,000
Aren't you gonna get another one?

456
01:02:45,050 --> 01:02:46,100
Your brother is going down
while you're taking all this glory!

457
01:02:46,200 --> 01:02:48,100
- Get out here if you dare!
- Fiona, please don't do this.

458
01:02:48,200 --> 01:02:49,300
Are you gonna beat me?

459
01:02:49,400 --> 01:02:50,900
Are you?

460
01:02:51,300 --> 01:02:53,300
Whenever you dump me,
I'll come right back here,

461
01:02:53,500 --> 01:02:54,800
unless you kill me.

462
01:02:54,900 --> 01:02:56,200
Kill me if you dare.

463
01:02:56,300 --> 01:02:57,700
Fong said he didn't want to see you.

464
01:02:57,800 --> 01:02:59,450
If you go one with this fuss
he's gonna kill us all.

465
01:02:59,550 --> 01:03:00,850
Did you hear that?

466
01:03:01,750 --> 01:03:03,450
Did you hear that?

467
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:05,500
What kind of animal is he?

468
01:03:05,600 --> 01:03:06,800
You've worked for him
for more than half of your lifetime.

469
01:03:06,850 --> 01:03:08,150
Now this is how he treats you.

470
01:03:08,250 --> 01:03:09,550
Wake up!

471
01:03:09,950 --> 01:03:11,250
Wake up!

472
01:03:13,300 --> 01:03:15,000
This business for me is so small,

473
01:03:15,100 --> 01:03:16,450
I'll share
what I've earned with everybody.

474
01:03:16,550 --> 01:03:19,150
- Fong, you betrayed Martin.
- I like this combination.

475
01:03:19,250 --> 01:03:21,850
- Everyone's happy, I'm happy...
- How is it fair to those who died!

476
01:03:21,950 --> 01:03:24,650
- Everyone's happy, I'm happy...
- How is it fair to Martin!

477
01:03:24,900 --> 01:03:26,400
Asshole!

478
01:03:26,850 --> 01:03:28,550
- Come down, you bastard!
- Boss is coming down.

479
01:03:33,800 --> 01:03:35,100
Taking care of it?!

480
01:03:35,200 --> 01:03:36,500
Taking care of it...

481
01:03:37,500 --> 01:03:39,500
Didn't you understand
what I was telling you to do?

482
01:03:49,600 --> 01:03:51,100
God damn you!

483
01:03:51,500 --> 01:03:54,150
You dared to betray your brother
but afraid of me?

484
01:03:54,250 --> 01:03:55,550
What a useless piece of shit!

485
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:59,500
Boss, she's our friend,
dont't do this!

486
01:04:02,500 --> 01:04:04,500
Boss, no!

487
01:04:04,650 --> 01:04:05,650
Let go!

488
01:04:06,800 --> 01:04:08,600
Don't let me see her ever again!

489
01:06:27,500 --> 01:06:30,500
( Former gangster become a beggar )

490
01:10:12,700 --> 01:10:14,700
He's back. Come out.

491
01:10:26,500 --> 01:10:28,000
Go talk to him.

492
01:10:28,500 --> 01:10:30,000
Don't be shy!

493
01:11:08,100 --> 01:11:09,300
Come on.

494
01:11:10,500 --> 01:11:12,000
Go upstairs.

495
01:11:19,500 --> 01:11:21,300
He lives in that room.

496
01:11:21,800 --> 01:11:23,300
He's so handsome!

497
01:11:23,400 --> 01:11:24,900
Have a good chat with him.

498
01:11:55,650 --> 01:11:58,150
Why did you come in here?
Get out!

499
01:11:58,900 --> 01:12:00,100
Get out! Go!

500
01:12:42,800 --> 01:12:45,800
( I am not coming back )

501
01:13:18,400 --> 01:13:19,800
Jack!

502
01:13:26,450 --> 01:13:28,650
This fax doesn't have a sender's name.

503
01:13:28,750 --> 01:13:32,550
But the fax number is the one which you
dialed to fax Hong Kong yesterday.

504
01:13:34,300 --> 01:13:35,800
Thank you.

505
01:16:58,900 --> 01:17:00,900
Over there! Up there!

506
01:18:52,200 --> 01:18:53,400
Martin.

507
01:18:55,500 --> 01:18:57,300
Could you treat me a drink?

508
01:18:57,400 --> 01:18:58,400
Sure.

509
01:19:19,350 --> 01:19:20,350
Martin.

510
01:19:40,650 --> 01:19:42,650
Fong is looking for you everywhere,

511
01:19:42,800 --> 01:19:44,100
I have a house in Mainland China...

512
01:19:44,150 --> 01:19:45,850
I want to listen to that song.

513
01:19:46,050 --> 01:19:47,050
Okay.

514
01:19:48,250 --> 01:19:49,150
Hey...

515
01:19:49,250 --> 01:19:50,350
stop that for a second.

516
01:19:50,400 --> 01:19:51,400
Quick.

517
01:19:51,500 --> 01:19:53,000
Play that song "Sukiyuki" first.

518
01:19:53,100 --> 01:19:54,750
- Which song?
- It's Sukiyuki.

519
01:19:54,850 --> 01:19:56,650
- That Japanese folk song.
- Sukiyuki?

520
01:19:56,750 --> 01:19:57,950
What the hell!

521
01:19:58,050 --> 01:20:00,050
- How can you guys make a living out of this?
- Can't recall, I don't really know.

522
01:20:00,150 --> 01:20:01,300
You listen to me, look at me.

523
01:20:01,350 --> 01:20:02,850
- Look at me...
- Okay.

524
01:21:03,100 --> 01:21:05,100
I don't like this many people around
when I'm drinking!

525
01:21:10,500 --> 01:21:11,800
Mr. Fong, Mr. Yam.

526
01:21:11,900 --> 01:21:12,900
Is everything okay?

527
01:21:13,300 --> 01:21:16,300
I've heard that you had kept
a very good bottle of wine here.

528
01:21:17,700 --> 01:21:18,700
Sure.

529
01:21:27,650 --> 01:21:28,650
Mr. Fong.

530
01:21:31,750 --> 01:21:33,550
I want that one.

531
01:22:02,350 --> 01:22:03,850
Brilliant!

532
01:22:04,450 --> 01:22:06,350
Do you know where Jack is?

533
01:22:06,450 --> 01:22:07,550
I don't know.

534
01:22:07,650 --> 01:22:08,650
Boss,

535
01:22:08,750 --> 01:22:10,750
I've found a fax from Thailand.

536
01:22:12,700 --> 01:22:13,700
Asshole!

537
01:22:13,800 --> 01:22:15,300
Such a waste of wine.

538
01:22:15,400 --> 01:22:16,900
Can't you find anything else
to beat him with?

539
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:18,700
Don't worry about that
if you have money!

540
01:22:18,800 --> 01:22:20,700
Get me a dozen tomorrow,

541
01:22:20,800 --> 01:22:22,600
otherwise you better watch out!

542
01:22:43,800 --> 01:22:47,250
This place has the
most beautiful sunset.

543
01:22:47,300 --> 01:22:48,800
If you want,

544
01:22:48,900 --> 01:22:51,400
I can build you a house here.

545
01:22:52,050 --> 01:22:55,450
The sky will get dark
sooner or later.

546
01:22:55,600 --> 01:22:59,000
If I could stay here forever,

547
01:22:59,200 --> 01:23:02,150
I wish it would be
sunset time every day.

548
01:23:02,250 --> 01:23:03,750
That I can't help you.

549
01:23:04,800 --> 01:23:11,200
I knew that I was born pretty
ever since I was twelve.

550
01:23:11,300 --> 01:23:13,100
When I grew a little older,

551
01:23:13,200 --> 01:23:18,000
I was afraid one day
I would have a chubby belly.

552
01:23:18,100 --> 01:23:21,300
Then I would scare
the person I love away.

553
01:23:21,600 --> 01:23:25,400
Once I had a very silly thought.

554
01:23:25,500 --> 01:23:29,400
I wish I would die before thirty,

555
01:23:29,500 --> 01:23:32,650
then my most beautiful moment
would stay forever.

556
01:23:32,850 --> 01:23:36,150
I really wish
could stay here forever,

557
01:23:36,250 --> 01:23:39,150
the sunset would hang like this
in the sky every day.

558
01:23:39,250 --> 01:23:44,250
Can you help me
solve this problem?

559
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:17,400
What is all these craps,

560
01:27:17,500 --> 01:27:18,700
you guys are like this
all the time.

561
01:27:18,800 --> 01:27:20,500
You can never get that right!

562
01:27:20,600 --> 01:27:22,100
It's like that...

563
01:27:26,100 --> 01:27:28,400
Okay?
Start again!

564
01:27:29,600 --> 01:27:31,400
You guys just didn't get it.
God damn it.

565
01:27:39,400 --> 01:27:40,400
Jack.

566
01:27:40,550 --> 01:27:41,550
Po.

567
01:27:41,850 --> 01:27:44,150
Martin couldn't wait for you
to come back for the wine.

568
01:27:52,850 --> 01:27:54,850
He just wanted to kill Fong himself.

569
01:27:58,700 --> 01:27:59,900
Wong,

570
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:01,500
this is Jack.

571
01:28:01,950 --> 01:28:04,850
Martin and I are going to
find Fong and Yam.

572
01:28:05,250 --> 01:28:06,850
Go tell everyone,

573
01:28:07,050 --> 01:28:09,550
if we're still brothers
then they should give away.

574
01:28:14,650 --> 01:28:16,000
Where did you hear that?

575
01:28:16,050 --> 01:28:17,400
- Go check out that guy from Thailand.
- Was it Wong who told you this?

576
01:28:17,450 --> 01:28:19,250
- Ask him if he knows the assassin has been paid.
- Go find him for me now!

577
01:28:19,450 --> 01:28:21,000
Mr. Fong,
those share holders said
this is our internal business,

578
01:28:21,050 --> 01:28:22,150
they won't get involved.

579
01:28:22,200 --> 01:28:23,200
What a bunch of jerks!

580
01:28:23,250 --> 01:28:25,050
Mr. Yam,
something happened at the nightclub.

581
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:02,900
A lot of people said
something big is gonna happen tonight.

582
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:05,000
Watch out for yourself.
Leave it you had a chance.

583
01:29:05,200 --> 01:29:06,400
Wasn't Martin dead,

584
01:29:06,500 --> 01:29:08,000
how can he be back?

585
01:29:08,100 --> 01:29:10,300
Someone said he was dead too
when we were in Thailand.

586
01:29:45,450 --> 01:29:46,550
How could this get in here?!

587
01:29:46,600 --> 01:29:47,500
Who put it here?!

588
01:29:47,550 --> 01:29:48,400
What were you guys doing?!

589
01:29:48,450 --> 01:29:50,450
- How could you let this happen?!
- I know!

590
01:29:50,650 --> 01:29:52,650
I let him put it there.

591
01:29:52,750 --> 01:29:54,250
What the fuck are you talking about?

592
01:29:54,300 --> 01:29:55,800
I give way.

593
01:29:56,100 --> 01:29:57,900
Martin's back.

594
01:30:12,100 --> 01:30:13,250
What are you looking at?

595
01:30:13,300 --> 01:30:14,400
Why are you scared?

596
01:30:14,500 --> 01:30:15,500
He's dead!

597
01:30:15,600 --> 01:30:17,000
Not yet.

598
01:30:17,500 --> 01:30:19,800
You take care of this yourself,
baldy Fong.

599
01:32:51,450 --> 01:32:52,950
Not yet dead?

- Scot, listen to me...
- You wait a minute.

608
01:35:39,300 --> 01:35:41,300
I'm positively certain
this bottle of wine is fake.

609
01:35:41,400 --> 01:35:44,500
The real one had been consumed
by Fong and Yam already.

610
01:35:44,600 --> 01:35:47,100
- John, you listen to me...

611

My friend's friend

613

For the sake of keeping that wine,

614
01:35:53,350 --> 01:35:54,850
he swapped this with
another one for them.

615
01:35:54,900 --> 01:35:56,100
So this one must be real.

616
01:35:56,200 --> 01:35:57,400
You finish?
It's my turn now.

617
